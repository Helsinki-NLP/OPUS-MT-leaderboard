A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat the fraud of elections.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by confirming that election fraud in the USA is rarer than the number of people killed by the flash.
By the way, the lawyers of the Republicans have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the USA in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of elections.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for the implementation of the elections in each country.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009, which make the registration or initial process difficult.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the November 2010 elections, where 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 drafts of law were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of election law in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require the voters to present a photo ID and evidence of the US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for the premature voting, the right to register as voters on the day of election, and the right to vote for a court act.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. State has requested the voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities hurried to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the last two years, they promoted drafts of laws in 34 Bundesstaaten, with which the voters are forced to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, that is, 21 million electorate, do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new selectors do not have such a certificate in 2012.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to obtain the necessary ID.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and low income.
In fact, 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of the people with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the electors between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary photo ID.
This is still enough.
Students who are considered to be electoral who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more for the Republican side to use the maps issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state has requested proof of citizenship for choosing.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting hispanese votes.
Because it is obvious that two of three hispanese electors prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislatures in 2011 promoted laws in eight states with which the registration of voters was abolished on the day of election.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to register voters at general elections in 2004 contributed to registering about 10 million citizens.
Because by the measures adopted since 2009, the share of the registration of new selectors in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislatures in five other federal states have adopted laws aiming at shortening the period for the premature voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida 33% of the voters elected in advance were Afro-Americans, although they represent only 13% of the electors of the state.
The same applies to the hispanese population.
The latter made only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who chose in advance.
On the other hand, the Whites, who represented 76% of the voters, made only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their adherents have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several drafts of law were blocked by the Vetos of the democratic governors.
The U.S. Advocate General has committed to suspending the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 federal states have adopted laws that require the display of a photo model.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of election law difficult.
The democratic critics plead the political nature of the laws adopted and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those States that have adopted these laws are 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral body to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation on the election system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of elections.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostata cancer early detection: should the test be made or not?
In fact, the PSA test points out sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to stronger distress of the men already unclosed to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be made or not?
We have received the opinion of two specialists.
In the U.S. studies, there were numerous disturbance factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that in a post-12-year post-observation, the probability of the formation of metastasis is increased by 30 to 40% if no early detection has been performed.
That is why I recommend the test from a age of 50 or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who has already been ill to prostate cancer.
In men of afro-American origin there is also a higher risk.
The most important is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been recognized.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others who are indolent.
The patient must be made truly understandable of the risk of its cancer by showing him the possible options that prostate cancers can remain untreated if they do not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, they are rather determined to monitor the disease actively.
Today, many men who recognize cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to their lives.
They are suggested active monitoring and offer them treatment in progression of the disease.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for a decision to be taken and who should not.
That is why I still recommend the execution of the test.
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the international urology society, Movember has developed a tool to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous means to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk to suffer from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if everyone would eat well and move enough.
"If there were no smokers anymore, this value would rise at least to 50%," emphasises André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, about 10% of cancer diseases are expected to be caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclean.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages the health of people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after abandoning the cigarette, the risk of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and adipositas also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast-, influenza-, maize-intestinal, food tube, abdominal glands and breast-intestinal cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity protects from influenza cancer throughout life," he adds.
Diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of an influenza or mastic intestinal cancer.
Worst goods should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoke, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their studies are not inconsistent at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another showed a higher level.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of speaking to his doctor about his concerns and family preloading.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson analyzed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs-Bosons has excited some reputation last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, one believes that this Boson is involved in nothing less than in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence of the standard model - our best or "the least false" explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter - was foretold, but was not yet empirically observed.
But for the physicists it is not completely certain that it really is the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is strongly similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large Physics Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be perfectly certain about it.
Still, we assume that this is actually the Higgs, since it seems that there is only a small risk of deceiving, and we are looking at what it is.
There is an imperative law in this world that does not allow two objects to be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too strongly as you become hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it is clear that such a law also applies to them: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "Quant State", with this "Sustainment" in the majority and all of them consists of some of their properties.
From that, the physicists share the particles in two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione and who like to obey the Pauli Principle.
And in the others, the Bosons move, a evil band of anarchists who are nothing holy - at least not this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same time at the same place.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to the website The Particle Adventure from the Berkeley Laboratories (which is absolutely amazing), the mesons we are not going to treat here and the "power particles" by which the great forces of nature are spreading and with which the Higgs Boson would somehow be related.
However, it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, only thanks to a Boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bot" of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle is accelerated with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this place, such as a pebblestone thrown into a pond.
This "distortion" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "drivers of power".
Stabile field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, needs to be "disturbed" so that this Boson shows itself.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the ignorance must reach very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be crushed by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself in the refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it possess a mass, while the others (as the photon by the way) do not possess mass.
For what can all these research be "good," Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists to examine precisely all the differences between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are many physicists who are desirable to hope that such deviations will be found, as the least difference opens a door to a "new physics" and could stop some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter is still large defects, as it does not explain the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (renew ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these research on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would not be any.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell Labour did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first long-term laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser at the beginning was considered a "Labor Playing".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also be derived from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle in 1969 developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "auge" and has introduced it in 2009 the Nobel Prize for Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the LHC's activities will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can really never know it...
Palliative Care - the best way to die...
With her Committee on Death in Würde, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon, even though a draft law is being prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that rose to him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived in the day before.
"Everything, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
At the table sitting in front of a delicious lunch, he resigns to be helpful in eating.
He can even smile and speak to the strangers who are busy around him, bring his medicines to him, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is to heal my diarrhoea because this is humiliating," he tells.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man ping in the stairs," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the home Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some.
"That depends on the ability of the person", he establishes a return step.
Because several people who work in palliative care are considered to take place great events in the middle of these steps.
The patients who are assigned to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who care for them will no longer overtake them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by stealing".
But because of the disease, I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no longer desires in life," she says before she accepts her a mask that helps her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy in the next days.
At the home Victor-Gadbois you offer a group of volunteers care and helping to take food.
Palliative care is then used if there are no other possibilities anymore.
To make the death more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care at 11.700 inhabitants.
This is very little if you take into account that we will all die one day.
Here life is continued under best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on the desire, the dying person grants a mouthcare with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetes no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
Today morning his son will drown the beer at the feet of the dead one.
"We help relatives and patients in the same way," reports Care Director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor Gadbois is not a day like the other one.
In addition to an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family meeting in the courtyard and is well supported by his head cushion while struggling to his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies in a tragic way after he has tried everything to survive.
"Since six months, three to five beds are always employed with cancer patients less than 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel distressed.
53% of patients who are assigned to Victor Gadbois are from their home, 47% are from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to provide care to reduce the suffering of patients when the latter reached the final stage of their life, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the company for domestic palliative care in Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
Exactly this great inadequacy in the health care of Quebec ensures that several physicians specialised in palliative care meet the adoption of a law to regulate death aid and assisted suicide with concern.
Since October, a manifest has been in circulation signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to demonstrate their contradiction to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all the right to high-quality palliative care has before accepting death aid.
Before a short time, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency recording without taking measures to illuminate her.
I fear that patients want to die only because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of the worst forecasts until the last day.
The survival opportunities of Hélène Richard were minimal when she stopped a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my uncologin that I would abort the treatment, she answered me that she regrets that I was going up with the fight, she told her.
But she told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff that it has not given this wish after their pain has been educated by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly said that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, Head of Palliative Care of the Society of Home Palliative Care of the Grand Montreal, 8% of patients do not address pain treatment.
All at the end of life, the doctors are therefore often referring to the terminal seedation that is about to slide the patient either sporadically or permanently up to the time of his death.
We can no longer do as if we do not see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be increasingly able to rely on this terminal seeding.
Patients whose pains are not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to sleep me," but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism stage of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandal large sizes in Quebec
Political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia, roadbuilding office, construction industry companies, businesses, businesses and businesses, each day tell what they know about a great "system", in which construction, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafioso are twisted.
A "industry" which was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system is collapsed since you've taken drastic measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, Deputy Member in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was discovered by him because of an in-depth examination of the contradictions related to the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which had only contradicted the former Prime Minister.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribes of officials.
"Since the beginning of the inquiry in 2010," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport saved a billion dollars on the contracts alone," as some instincts relieved to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to fall," he adds, hoping that you are able to "show the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The 2011 established permanent anti-corruption unit also takes great effort with its troops to auditors, detectors and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police of the Marteau-Truppe, which since 2009 has caused the "channelization cardll" of Montreal to be more reluctant in the artificial exploration of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has made a series of house searches and has raised accusations of fraud and corruption against local mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his office as the mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected that in exchange for public contracts, it has repeatedly accepted lubricants.
In addition, engineers of the Montreal Road Building Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were accused.
The latter has excited attention by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal for several years to a mediator connected with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito played his hand everywhere by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approx. 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially those who were in power at that time.
He also agreed to have organized an illegal funding for former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Channelization contracts whose costs were artificially raised by it
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tours, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribe payments of $736,000 as compensation for channelisation contracts, whose cost he artificially blew.
Other roadbuilding officials have admitted that they were allowed to shrink by artificially exploring the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, a organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his cashes with black money.
As a result of these disclosures, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, causing Montreal to fall into a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first Members who struck alarm.
As the mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Pairies, in the eastern part of the island, she refused to sell a municipal property that was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to farmers in the booming real estate market.
70% Black Money in Election Campaigns
From the investigation which is finally carried out, she says that it "take on a thread that allows it to understand the functioning of the ants undermined system to stop the evil and provoke the debtors".
She says that the process is "acheful but positive".
However, we are trying to clean the wounds, we need a detection unit only for Montreal, as well as a supervisor to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on the other hand, notes that "officiers have stolen several hundred million dollars," but mainly thought about the role of the "mandates who are about the tactics in the image", if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a share of 70% black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he wits: "I was told that this was only a weak absurdity of reality."
Quebec's government proposes to limit the donation of parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "Unless the electoral expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for public procurement and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going on the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh at it to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
During this season, you have adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me much.
These elements stimulate me daily to improve my level of play.
And in a game this is even easier.
It's going very fast in the football.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playtime at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress in progress.
So they take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this summer are used to carry out games very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me, who has to offer the forehead and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti implies respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in the Ligue 1, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he put in me is also an explanation for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon took us the seat of the top rider.
But we're listening in the back.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified in this way for the eight-elfinal.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to talk about very good European teams about our words.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the replay of the eight-elfinale as a home game.
Can the PSG become a big European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a big European association, Paris has to win titles and make itself a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives its resources to adopt concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1 as this was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really have the heart of voting this title.
During the last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to take the victory away.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the great teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring around the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept this perfectly.
But if we win Troyes 4-0 in a home game, and you still find something you can suggest, that is certainly a little frustrating.
You're wondering what the people still expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to create a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
We proved strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club who hasn't been able to qualify for the eighteen finale for two seasons, and who has also made huge expenditure!
With regard to the amounts invested, you were believed to be the game break with 15 points ahead!
That was called that our opponents and the French championship would be left out of mind.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be the smiling winner in May and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's services.
So much better that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependence".
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he reminded him that he was a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders worldwide, also allows all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French National Team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to take part in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injuries prevented me from spilling out some time.
I've seen things from which I've been strengthened.
Today I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our teachings, and today we have to show an exemplary behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national trainer is strict, close to the players and stimulates to victory.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had reached his goal by qualifying us for EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the forced disagreement (1:1) in Spain on 16 October a retirement game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has been employed for all the others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often as in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system designed by bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertable to dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchanges such as BitTorrent that enables direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin reached a maximum of $30 in June 2011 (23 euros), he fell to $2 five months later before he recovered to around $10 today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" that are used to advance in a video game that can be won or purchased through games (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all net nodes are simultaneously keepers of the accountbook, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
By means of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded are available in the public accounts in the entire network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This happens through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner who is a kind of provisional central banker who has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a piece of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "shacked".
The goal is to find the number that results in a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay the same money twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without link because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in the circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be shared up to a hundred million, which makes some room...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with every improvement in the calculation performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering by means of this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these defects.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
By others such as the blog platform WordPress they are accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega lock sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, is pleased to convert the Bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin uses to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with the dealers, and the latter do not have to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat insures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are considered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time to get through bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
By the way, in its report, the ECB proposes to re-evaluate the various risks which have been considered today in the event of a success of this currency.
We've been withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army reaps the possession of its territory and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and innocent.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse a armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local rebellions, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries are discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base point in Nijrab, which I have observed by a hill planted with a mandel trees, which was financed by French loans, took place properly.
The truck and tank convoy flooded by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more flows of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was over from war due to the fights of the various rebellious groups.
Their acquisition of power was then regarded as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved until now.
Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the joint desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main personalities of the anti-Sowjet war came back to power in 2001.
They have transformed themselves into businessmakers by confiscating lands of the government to sell them as a construction country to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive U.S. subcontracting.
They have been provoked, and most of them have not been involved in the fighting themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people wish a government that is not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who could make American contributions: the capital flight is significant.
The young people have satisfied the war and ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed their advantages.
About 65% of the population is below 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
There's a army now.
Are the authorities under whose command they will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Sowjet struggle are already trying to restore the militia in the province which will withdraw from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from some decentralisation in the Western nations' example, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the USA wanted to make from him a centralized state with a strong presidential authority.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular in the event of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industrials have not been rebuilt, functional steams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is the priority.
In a country based on 30 years of war, government control of infrastructures would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan possesses immense soil treasures.
This strengthens the impression that the western countries were only on the spot to empower them.
Without energy to process the iron or copper erce on site, or without any means of transport for export over the mountains is not possible mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) make their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French fighting forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and young people, French Institute at universities, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abandoned in 2012, has performed in dozens of mountain villages numerous non-profit work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to achieve the "hearts and spirits" and the impossible task of compatibility of aid and open action.
These work, for which numerous local workers were required, could help to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase agricultural areas.
What souvenir do we leave back after military expenditure of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these often at a height of more than 2000 meters.
The message received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising of foreign groups, which is, according to their own statements, its wish would be to continue with less, well-controlled and directly related civilian aid in favour of them.
A Constitution with the Breastange in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more than ever divided with regard to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him the unlimited power, he decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
A week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has now been based for almost two years on a provisional, multi-changed text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal convergence.
This new initiative has only provided for an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "take right with feet".
It is assured on its supporters that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transitional process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to refrain from their plan to explain to the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the President, it is also a way to recognize its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is raging throughout the country.
After reaffirmations in an interview with the U.S. Weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will be willing to vote.
For the Egyptian people with this reciprocal reciprocal vote, an ultimatum is set: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power," the latter should supposedly end after the Constitution was adopted.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration mid-November, they have turned away as they believe that they have not been able to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
Last morning, 11 people, Deputy Members, were added to reach the decision-making capacity.
Some are very close to the moslims.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly unanimously adopted.
The commentators, by the way, found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... has been expressed in the time for prayer, since some members of the body believed that the pendulum clock of the constitutional congregation was not accurate.
The text, which has been adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 which attracted all attention, finally remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of the Scharia are the main source of law".
The salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of substituting "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is evidence of their good will and of their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Saintness" replies to the liberals who only view this as a propaganda strike.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution takes place on other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220 which recognizes a consultative function to the University of Al-Azhar, in particular as regards the verification of conformity with the laws of the Scharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is alarming, since "the persons who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy here."
The fears of the liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next rector of this university is much less modest than the present.
"Today there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, who have been partly trained in the French system," said Alexis Blueet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian Constitutional Transition.
He admits, however, "that in relation to Article 220 there can be a mercifulness, as the terms used have been rejected by the religious vocabulary.
In particular, it refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamic caselaw, Anm. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide about it."
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Moslems argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wish, the examination of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Similarly, there will not be a ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have requested.
The latter also share their fears with regard to the text which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The situation of blasphemy will be maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, in particular for the press.
In addition, no longer refers to the protection of women, Heba Morayef underlined by Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The advocates of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The praised country unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort, and unaffected nature.
AIF calls you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Getting Blowed Before the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It means that all those bathing in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding celebration, walking on the water, breast-feeding of the sea storm and fishing.
Just here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here take the path of suffering or cruise of Jesus Christ (on Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, the presidency, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the grave church on the mountain of Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the brick of salvation and the grave of Jesus are located.
Here is, according to the Christian view of the navel of the world, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is located in the place where a Christian legend has founded the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the complaint wall, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different beliefs there leave notes with desires that will then be fulfilled.
A trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hidden from enemies, which Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains in 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins from their own strength.
All others bring an air sailway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, 1600 to 2040 meters are located in the famous Hermon ski resort, where it moves countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The skiers have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were said to live on the mountain peak.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited on just one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Below is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parlament).
There, old Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in rock holes in the Judean desert, are stored and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which hosts several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum leaders nor souvenir shops.
The entry is free and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most thrilling department is the monument for the children built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When the room enters, there is complete darkness.
Stars funk.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing Something for Health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolfinars and oceanarias.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The dead sea is even warmer and there is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thereby even bears non-swimmer problemless on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt solesole) and healing mud as well as for the treatment of skin inflammations, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and calming of sensible nerves.
Affect the Mysteries of Ancientity
These secrets hold the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous seaway, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia were connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah built his Arche right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he had a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to swallow through the narrow gases named after star signs.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend after all who touch the walls in the street with their star sign.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can tread through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the crucifixes.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are listed today.
Favourites for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor English knowledge: Approximately 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
You prefer to take the money on your trip into no euros, but in dollars that can be easily switched into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get ahead with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway train and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations connecting the suburb to the upper city.
In fact, it is a underground highway.
A ride within the city costs 6 shekels, which includes a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is held in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week starts.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only food is served, which includes pork meat, marine products, fish without shoes and foods, which contain both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hammer and beef meat, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus passes, various soßes, fritted balls of poured beans and grapes (falafel) as well as fruit and vegetables.
There are no strenuous dogs in the streets of Israel's cities.
For this there are many well-fed cats that strangle through the streets cozy and unilluminated.
In the evening you can even see her sleeping on the roofs parking cars.
The cats may be busy places and don't say no to delicious eggs.
A car rental costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) up to 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs additionally $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Entry cards for museums cost 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists entered the lobbyed country, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the visa obligation was repealed on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Members and civilians discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already acting with false certificates
Yearly, 13 million host workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force which, according to each labor migrants, must present a test certifying knowledge of Russian language.
To date, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, the tests, according to the Federal Migration Authority, will be required for all host workers in the future.
It is not only necessary to make language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both receipt and renewal of work permits.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian official language is.
This law also excludes those who have received their certificates of training and diplomas prior to the destruction of the USSR in 1991.
Sentence, problems and protection of rights
The totality of the audit points will be included in the archipelago of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the entry into force of the law in the press, civilian lawyers repeatedly asked the following question: What does the whole thing happen?
What changes do the prescription brings to show language skills for both the Russians and the host workers?
Especially, dismissed speakers of the migration authority, it is important to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many speak about the protection of the rights of workers' migrants," says the head of the representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must already be protected from their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of foreign workers' problems.
Migrants face problems without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language knowledge will necessarily meet people with evil intentions that put him under the pretext of help into a dark, narrow barack, where he will endure with dozens of his same months without food and documents and create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home, the One is promised to you, and when you arrive, you are deceived, get their passports and don't get the promised wage," confirms the head of the Chief Labour Administration of the Tajikian Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't shample, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they cannot only dominate the language of the target country but can hardly express themselves in their own language.
Of course, this is not their fault, rather than the evil: only a few Turkmens, Uzbeks and Tadjikens can afford a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, to buy them decent clothing, shoes, and school stuff.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to deserve money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens emphasize the important aspect of the law.
The test must only store migrants with legal status.
If you don't have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most of the host workers continue to be illegal in Russia.
"Human welcome" or "not allowed access to unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic barriers and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Furthermore, legalisation costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly falsified and we are not registered, and that will result in cases of expression.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says Tajike Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Don't shy any costs for wrong papers"
Already on the date on which the law entered into force, it was found that not only the registration documents of migrants could be falsified.
Some false certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with a normal colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them for nothing: any migrants who hoped to save the tests would pay for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the costs for the official test: this costs a working migrants three thousand rubles.
In addition to the fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be purchased easily, both officials and civilian lawyers agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise host workers who fall through the test for the first time that they receive time for a language basis course.
In addition, new arrivals are offered without language skills in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal weapons market
Percentage of legal weapons in crimes very low
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to intensify the arms law for private arms owners.
The authorities respond to recent events: injured in shootings on weddings and seven dead in the amocratic run of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to prohibit the carrying of non-residual weapons in the public and raise the age for the possession of shot weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act were submitted shortly by the Duma.
Not all are pleased that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attacking screws".
On the Internet, an open letter was published, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - demanded that the authorities take away from "sinceless intensifications".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the Interior Ministry's statistics, 142 crimes with the application of the registered weapons were carried out over six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a sharpening of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from operating on the black market.
At present, according to the authors in Moscow, you can find every possible weapon for little money.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Interior stresses that the distribution of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons come across several channels to the black market.
There are five such main channels, a former captain Viktor Baranez, who worked ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Board.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapon orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are being stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from the police's arms chambers as well as directly from the police's staff of the law enforcement authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arms camps.
In many military camps there were often explosions.
"There are evidence that some cases were burning to hide the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
In accordance with Baranez, a contribution to the black market also contributes to weapon manufacturers.
"Today there are countless private armor plants that do not stand up to international competition and therefore slip the weapons under hand on the black market, such as Moscow," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is one of your own, sometimes handicraft productions, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Ministry of State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly accessible data on portals on weapons.
The main part of the illegal weapons is that of the army and the legal protection authorities.
The half of all weapons on the black market were there through the "skuld of responsible people who have been dealing with weapons in their work," says the report.
According to data from the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to theft in weapon production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant of a weapons shop, who does not want to be called namely, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have not been buying any more for a long time since they are outdated.
According to him, it is more frequent that dealers get the postage in a weapon camp.
A gun, for example a gun from the type TT, is purchased via a fehnrich.
The gun is issued and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon to the city and sells it for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, knows everything, and therefore, if it cannot compete with the plan to detect crime, periodically carry out control purchases in dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"How in luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers are most commonly found by acquaintances.
I had viewed websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested to come to the "Begowaja" station, where a person would wait for me that would bring me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
I first learned the prize for the gun
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go and take a code like "by Iwan Iwanowitsch, who can say that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I even come to some strokes about a friend I trust.
He also delivers the strokes to me because he knows I don't care about it.
Newers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to the schemes, he did not change.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was pictured.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the sack, but can try everything out.
I buy as a potential customer not only, but go with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the action.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vcontacts", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy fighting gun or gun".
There, users will file your orders and submit requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license," asks user "Iwan" (resident quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless headlines, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go up to the service.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shake coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank automation.
"As an answer, he gets a photo and a description of the hide of the weapon," says the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end you can go empty and get behind grids when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless headlines, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go up to the service.
"The people come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shake coal," he says.
A Makarow for 100 US dollars
According to experts, when buying illegal weapons, prices of US$100 to 900 are expected.
According to Dmitry Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a pistol from the type of Makarow for $100 to $300.
You have to wait for one and a half months.
The weapon is spent in military arms camps by overseers in the middle range.
According to the official statistics of the Interior Ministry, the number of delicates with illegal weapons throughout Russia fell by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22,9 thousand, while the number of cases covered by the robbery and depression related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket employees in the USA
Every fourth U.S. youth sits behind Mc Donald's box sometime
In the past days, there have been massive protests in the United States against low wages in Walmart branches and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Neither can anyone predict whether the protests will continue to swell, or whether they will soon return to the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several links-oriented non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple walmart and fast-food workers, the protests' organizers pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, on which sales took place in the USA, which attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to handcuffs.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put their work down and strived together with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group are low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from windels via hunting guns and car batteries to dust cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is averaged between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the smallly paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart is often able to sell the product so affordablely because the employees are paid badly.
The latter also complain about severe working conditions, for example, lack of fork or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on the "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's own health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart co-worker who earns $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars the hour, Walmart would cost 3.2 billion dollars.
These are about 1.1% more than they now donate for wages.
If Walmart would completely convert the wage increases to customers, every purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be for them a year compared to today's added expenditure of just 12.39 dollars.
Walmart’s supporters are pleased to find that only in nine states there was protests and they did not give any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted the next day in its shop from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart boxes performed almost 100 million transactions on the "Black Friday".
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the Huffington Post's left-hand website that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had been working and the protest action was merely "another PR-trick" of the trade union that organized the protests.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where, however, their goal was not Walmart branches (which are not desired in this advanced city and so far inexisted), but were McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given any sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage in accordance with federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York get 8.90 US dollars the hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it's possible to spend so little money in New York, I'm incomprehensible.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of U.S. youths were behind McDonald's after school, but the young people still lived with their parents.
Some of them saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to come out of this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, whose authors note that it is not responsible to get children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars, which is more than a double of the present minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the Fast Food Branch.
The U.S. law prohibits the management of the company to stand in the way of this objective and to reject or abandon trade union members.
On the other hand, the management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the Fast Food Branch is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Dissatisfied
In Manhattan, there were also many other fast food restaurants that day.
The summit of the protest was a congregation in the afternoon before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including Jumaane Williams City Council, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and nevertheless you are not given sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support fast-food employees so that they can obtain a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to New York Times, this was the largest action of her kind in the history of American fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, not all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is still not possible to see if the radio of these protests will mobilise whole masses.
"The brain can only be overlisted moderately so far"
The theme of enlarged reality, which is popular with adherents of modern technologies, is usually seen by the lens of a special glass in recent times.
First, Google presented a functioning model at his annual conference in summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also registered a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft Lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company were only a transit station.
It encourages the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with mere hands and creating virtual spaces.
- Please describe what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has remained mostly in the phase, working with pixels on flat screens that are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look forward to 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and nowadays no more Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in movement control.
- What else will we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things still play on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more fascinable.
However, it is necessary to recognise not only the user but also its environment.
Then we could add the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of this stupid virtual reality helmet!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- She is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as she raises questions about privacy, because you don't always want to inform all the others about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their specific niche.
For example, in the field of control of objects on public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and narrow, rather than with outloading gestures.
The gestures were recorded, not by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically could be reduced to the size of a clock.
But as a whole, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as Gestik and Sprache.
- How?
- We'd ask you, for example, to give you this spray dose?
They say it and simultaneously explain it.
- Usually, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the same time and what?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we will have to work mainly on the development of new sensor types, allowing us to get more accurate responses from people.
For example, this can be laser sensors, as they offer a good resolution in the depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you put from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Does it lack resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
This is how all present technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Man's movements are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed in our Redmond laboratory a touch sensor with a regulatable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed exactly such a device, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared station and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras may be able to solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Beautiful would be a flexible, Kinect-like system, in which we could play with different camera tendencies to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
- If I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of technology of enlarged reality in everyday life the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone on the road always in the elevated hand, but I think that the most great variant would be a "changing" extended reality in which we could switch over a cloud from the glass to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there is their strength (Privates can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortals.
There is a problem that often points to critics of this idea: there is no sensible reaction!
The hands don't feel at all!
What answers will your group give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the fact that the enlarged reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth breakthrough could well become the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an unusual projection document.
She's excellencely perceived pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" a little hand-resistant, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays in a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still as weak as someone poured over the handballs.
There are also tapes for the wrist that affect the nerves in the fingers, too, that is a potential direction.
- Did you try to overlap the brain?
It thinks it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to fight for a long time, namely to believe a person who is physically in a closed room, instead it is in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with cargo bands (other than in fitness studios), movable platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be overlisted moderately, and there are many years of work before us.
This makes work in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: in many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburger Avantgarde" project, dedicated to the city's residents who form the Avantgarde of Art and Culture.
On the reader list, high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the beardies dressed in red, who can be hit at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene tours or on failures.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and through his presence on the street, he chews his fellow citizens a smile into the face and provides them with a good mood.
Before a short time, he took a rotary organ and became the Petersburg sculptor, since he finally felt ready for this difficult role with regard to his artist being, his philosophy and his image.
Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in town?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who is dealing with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the grey, aggressions and bad behavior arises.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be painter?
- At an exhibition in the Newskij Culture Palace, where my works were exhibited.
I understood I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonevschina", from which "Puschkinskaja 10" was created, and then it was only one time.
I'm attracting it to theatre, fashion, music, actually to everything, except literature.
- And all of this was united in your art clinic... - It was important for me to be at the center of the Petersburg culture, where the best artists were to gather together.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Puschkinskaja 10, and there, until the renovation work, there was a musical artistic club for the Bohemians, the house of the Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schur with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Snur and his friends sang simple songs on the playback, weared tremendous Trikots and among them also belonged to the composer Igor Wdowin who was today.
When the group started playing live, it became from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his big career, but he learned the foundations with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originates in the art clinic.
Our staff and regular guests went there.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press on the award of "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and I was thus at the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today's time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now I'm hurting it, and I'm afraid to be like that.
In a clown, all of this confuses and loses his tragedy.
I love the Greatske, and I have great ideas.
Let us, for example, save the world by prescribe that everyone has to dress himself completely.
Now everyone respects the clothing and orients itself on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you don't have to give a man your hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears through the dressing.
Soon we saw you in the role of the city's rotor player.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
Earlier, people formed large groups: Bohemia loved one and the simple people the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it's difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one hundred dollar note that loves everyone.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 trailers.
- But several thousand come to Stas Michailow!
- Abandoned women come to him, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come, and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is ruined.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy it.
In my youth I have painted such pictures that even hanged in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumer has no culture at all, that's something quite different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say, Servants of culture.
But not everyone of them can deal with culture.
It was different in the real tsars because the tsars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have those who might be experts, but they are blocked the way, as it requires higher-level experts who properly evaluate the first ones and make them clear the way.
Now only the own taste counts.
The same applies to Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore need to look for other museums.
What is it for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding soil.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural soil because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less with us.
Art must be again modern, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is financed from grants of the city of St Petersburg
Birth in the World
Earth in danger.
Heating or collision with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthquake on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, is the important question of how we can plant ourselves in the weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are many choices.
The facto is only two real planets that we could at least be in a hypothetical place.
"Natural Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only possible at a large height or in the Venus circular, so in all.
The question of reproduction in the All first dealt with the researchers in terms of flora.
A half-century earlier experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of inheritances grown in the orbit did not differ in the least of the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flying (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, Wachteleier was sent to the world to explore the effects of severity on the development of embrios.
It develops a very normal chicken.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the chicken has to stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without a solid underground, the chicks flooded wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn were completely stumbling.
The chicks did not respond to light and sounds.
Four days later, they just died.
"Two times we let chicken punch and then put the whole thing in, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Wladimir Sychew for a failure experiment with the chickens in the all.
The last cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only gender species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into the all.
There was nothing special in this regard.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and research needs to be continued," notes Wladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats received offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space could not be solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are screwed out of their natural habitat can simply not follow their reproductive drive.
In contrast to animals, humans could be the basic.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying into the all for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereschkowa.
The most valuable humanity is the female organism.
Our Möwe fled from it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to life after that flight?
"Somely nobody answered this question," says Space Veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, was a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in the All, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in the orbit and even did work outside the space vehicle, was a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even at flights in the orbit," Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation concludes.
Yet, humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravitation.
The hydrolaboratorium in the Preparation Centre of the Cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a sweat state, the cosmonaut routine wins for work in the open space.
The water represents the severity.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a strange environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders were to testify that life in the country came from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the mother's abdomen in the fruit water, and that it can then become easier used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming just passes 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, while for a newborn child the severity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of severity, the abdomen and basin muscles are rapidly reduced and thus the ability to express the child is also diminished.
All right, we're going to handle this through birth-introduction aid.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to express the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not-insignificant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the education, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in a load suit in the orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is essential for his life.
"This experiment that we make together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring about a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person," predicts the director of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the world is mere theory.
But sometime it will be real when the earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships break up into a remote planet, which will be home for their all - born offspring.
NKÚ-Chef: Control of the Black System fails by policy debt
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and appropriate laws in connection with public contracts, but it falls down in its application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Newvyší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it needs to be properly applied - and this is not the case with us in my opinion," says Kala the current situation.
A similar result seems to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he introduces the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, it cannot simply come to the government chairman, and the control office whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law is obstructing its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Committee on the Control of the Chamber of Members, you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries relating to public contracts were compared.
What was the matter about?
This is a parallel examination with which we started about two years ago.
Simplifiedly, it is about the European legislative to determine how public contracts are to be handled and to build up national legislation, and, finally, there is still the practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to find extremely interesting differences. Generally, the laws in us may be even more "strengthen and more perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules again and again. It is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project?
Especially such a common control could help us to stop trying to constantly perfect the laws and reduce and depreciation of thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economicality means to acquire a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that we only stress the system in this way with excessive "paper cram" and those looking for gaps in the system have much easier to use the system than when the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Declaration Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German pendant to the NKÚ of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to that of us and also has a college that is just a little differently formed. However, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. that these bills are also available in each of the federal countries - the German system is different from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds which correspond to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would like to compare this without specific information, but Germany is often described as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Could that be because the auditors are better there?
I do not, but, as said, I do not like such comparisons.
In this regard, it is still noted that the countries which are an example for us also have problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything about cooperation with our authority, would they?
With regard to Czech legislation, what significance to your authority has been given to the renovation of the procurement law, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this Novelle is only in force for a short time, it has not yet been affected in our trials.
As our controls take place afterwards, we have to expect some delay here.
So far, we have more impacts in the preparation phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control instrument "Discovering risks of inefficacy" and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here, of course, the changes will affect, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may be that the rules will become "strengthen" and can no longer be complied with.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination are accountable to the institution (e.g., in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the award law is equivalent to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But is it useful, then, to make the law even more rigorous?
I do not think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form error which does not affect the actual decision making.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
Let's first say what path is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not illuminate the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "Black System" - what does that mean?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, it cannot simply come to the government chairman, and the control office whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law may be impeded in its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing would be.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain processes - and that is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer alone due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I think is missing from us.
On the streets there are a lot of iron, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice-plated.
However, the streets are mostly well available, sometimes increased caution is needed.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well available this morning, separately ruled snow and ice glads.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should become somewhat warmer.
In the region it is no longer cutting, and in the deeper altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, on the cheems of the Arch Mountain are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, there was a limited view of fog.
The R6 highway and the roadways of the first road class in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is given to bridges where the trains are sometimes required and smooth.
In any case, all roadways of the second and third road class are available, including the mountain roads.
On these roads, however, the necessary or exhausted snowrests remain separately.
In particular in the higher situations, therefore, increased attention is needed.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Bohemia, there is danger of glitter, in higher locations and in the mountains is still a skilled snow layer on the streets, the road and motorway directorate will report on their websites.
The street championships warn drivers of ice cream, which can occur especially in higher locations in Pardubice District.
In particular, it can be found on roadways of the second and third road class in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlickéhory Mountains.
A skilled snow layer is located on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely defeat-free.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The roads in the district of Pilsen are well available today, but locally, increased attention is needed, and the route is adjusted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has been cut before and the temperatures then fell, it can be on the streets to ice cream.
Locally, fog is also expected, but the view will improve in the course of the day.
These information is derived from the district street championies.
The D5 motorway is practically fully available, but increased attention is recommended between the 80th and the 131th kilometre.
The roadways of the first road class are mainly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the circles of Pilsen and Tachov, however, there can be some iron smoothing.
The routes of the second and third road class are moist and therefore also apply here to the possible required sections.
The drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
Olomouc District
Today, snow mats have to expect drivers traveling towards the altitudes in the district of Olomouc.
After the use of scattering vehicles snow matsch remains on the passport Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snow drives forced the street championships to use, in the district of Šumperk, according to road management information, about 3 cm of new snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the tramways are mostly fully accessible.
"In the Šumperk circle, snow remains in the altitudes.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to expect snow matsch towards Jeseník," said a road management staff Šumperk today to the Agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník circle had to go out the night, according to their information, the roads are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc circle, the roads are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk circle, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the trams are still moist.
District Ústí nad Labem, Liberec District
In North Bohemia, the street championships report several badly flyable road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice glitter, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is locked in the circle of Ústí n.K. according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain in deeper locations below zero, so that snow and ice will be kept on the streets. From the deep plains, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, there are no problems reported, and the streets are usually dry there.
Until now, no traffic disturbance has been reported.
Ice glaciers are reported in particular from the Štětí circulation.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this during the night - during the day of rain and melting snow, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
From the main trains as well as from the road I/13 at the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec, poor transport conditions are reported.
The locking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to trunks which were pushed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think that in less than a month of the world's decline will take place?
This is one of those disaster reports that we like to jump to people.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more funny and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's fall.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world down.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It is a nationwide beneficiary event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is forecast for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20th, three concerts take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time from 21:00 p.m.
The end of the concerts should be in about the time at which the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone about 12 hours ahead of us.
Who's this idea from?
Originally of me, then we developed the idea together with our graphician Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect sufficiently positive energy to prevent the fall of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the condition in which we give this world our children once.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key adherents against the world bottom, with which the people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other artists, has also included the so-called hymne against the world's fall with the title "World Down Fall Out".
Today, the hymne on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound at the beneficiary concerts?
Of course, all the way to conclude, provided everything works and does not take place...
The hymn should be sang at the same time by all artists at all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are transferred live together in a direct switch from Czech television.
The text of the hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also sings Xindl X with...
How did you come to cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the realization of many beneficiary events and concerts...
We are trying to intensely integrate these people into our projects.
It has shown that most are interested in cooperation with us and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the outcome of the concerts against the fall of the world?
For the establishment of the free of barriers, Studeo, where we have been working with the association Tap in the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by lectors who help them in various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lectors, we would like to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we are expected to create a own building in which we will then enter with this project.
At each concert, several groups and artists appear.
What criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to set up a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere and Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appear.
Find out more on the www.kpks.cz website.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May we will be present at Prague Spring for the first time, and we will also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year, we would like to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - would like to associate this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you treat these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. Of course, we need to drag many instrument bags and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I have sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your foreign travels, you have a comparison of how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just witnesses in Russia that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Against Prague, Moscow is absolutely not hindered. There it is still unusual when someone in the wheelchair is travelling alone in the city centre.
It is not even obvious there that you prefer a wheelchair driver, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we need to pick up the developing countries?
There are many things in which we're hanging behind...
However, it should be noted that improvements in the situation are always dependent on the efforts of the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can move themselves in the public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not normally that there is a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social events, in which we are a little ahead with the band The Tap the West!
Respect in the public and accessibility is a matter, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our series, things will really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly desirable personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back for a few years: What motivated you to build a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a manager at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensively.
And since I am a musician myself and play Saxofon among others, I founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with the time, it is as our fashioner, Láca Angelovič, is doing something out of control (lacht).
But the band became known only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also begun to actively recruit for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and you cannot see this outside, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good lectors, high-quality equipment and etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that one could handle things differently.
In the show business, one often copys the other today.
This is logical in his way, since everything is considered new with caution and is only accepted after a longer period of time.
There are only few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the viewer mostly has is of course compassion; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not a single and abandoned being that we would have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, if they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for them themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss to hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and also require some discipline.
I think this is quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have sampled twice a week, have to complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm is loosened with many quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one one: Láca Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and wants to participate is always welcome to us.
Finds place on the day before the forecasted world down, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three events are finally connected by live sessions, and a common interpretation of the hymne "Worlddown falls out" of the band The Tap Tap.
The goal of the concert is to establish the resources for the equipment of a multifunctional disabled educational centre that is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, cards are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was joined as the twentieth member of this Space Authority at a Ministerial Council meeting of the Member States of the European Space Organisation ESA, with Poland as the second member of the former Eastern Block (after Czech Republic, which became a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's path to space began much earlier.
Earlier before World War II, Polish cosmos enthusiasms were involved in space travel, not always in understanding.
For example, I remember the lecture by A. Šternfeld of December 6, 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Introduction to cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) made the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won Prix REP-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important defender of astronomy and spacefare.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's globally recognized contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, by the name of one of the craters on the walled side of the moon after him.
Already in 1925, a railway dragon was built in Poland for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the design and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clarified whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the draisin.
The information for this is solely from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-operated shoots.
The research carried out by the Institute of Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents submitted, it is clear that research has occurred until the stage of practical tests.
The research was then obviously interrupted by the invading of the German military force.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric hunting missile appeared in the press of Ing. Rohoziński, and the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the raket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the previous Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, his work was finished from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this company is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At the time, there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was clear that the research of the space would have a future.
The Polish space company PTA tried to join the International Federation for Space in 1951, which was founded in 1956, and in fact the PTA became an ordinary member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation of Space.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has contributed significantly to the development of the highly successful meteorological rockets (Rakieta Meteorlogiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start was on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not entirely 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, the Błędów flight test started with the RM-2 two-stage missile.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should already be able to perform real scientific work - the Rakete RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for monitoring height winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was stopped.
Following the first rocket of type RM, the meteor-1 rocket developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-speed missile, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of rockets (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, different from each other in the size of the transport room for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rocket has a 0.4 litre-performance transport room, meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km at all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2-Rakete was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests started in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which followed two years later the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The abolition of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court established the law on non-profit work.
This decision called for a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem once from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final effect, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unsatisfactory financial speculations.
Due to the great differences in the value of work ( wages) there are price tensions.
Under this concept, a state in which the manufacturer is trying to remain in economic competition by importing favourable goods by "providing competition" in order to increase a greater market share in itself and increase its profit.
In large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy them cheaply or to give up their business.The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear social responsibility and thus no responsibility for unemployment caused by it, the government expenditure is necessarily increasing.
This situation is still strengthened by the fact that the gentlemen are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the overall social and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics at this point are superfluous.
The unconsiderable practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own populations without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly expressed in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictate of private capital, particularly in the wage sector.
On the one hand, this is done by economic forces in long-term unemployment, on the other through the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and rich.
In Germany, there have been public food donations for arms for several years, who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work.
The number of people concerned is already going to the millions.
During the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are cases where workers receive such a low wage that the State must increase its income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The savings will undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level (as it was the case in the 19th century), or to devote a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that private investment capital will flow into the country at some point.
Here, of course, is the question of where this capital comes from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty from one country is going to another; or capital remains completely out, for in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, employees are working for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media, until the overthrow, claim that the State should not participate with capital in its own economy and that plan economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital is strongly persistent in its view that the State must not act in a direct way into the economy.
But then one must wonder whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practically almighty and in all the states present lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual prosperity, legislation, in which practically everything is struggling, but nothing is criminal.
In Germany, the situation is so that a State Ministry is responsible for the development of legal drafts for private, close to the industry.
These laws are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence will then not go out of the people as the Western Constitutions declare it, but of strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal democracies are currently rapidly in a situation as they describe Appian in his work on the Roman Republic crisis at times Caesars and Pompeius': "The state has long been devastated, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against lubrication, by unlawful merger of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption woelessly, and the people went with already purchased votes to vote" ... "People with character did not recognize themselves for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "Man really began to speak about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a single domination, and that a strong man had to be chosen"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by sole rule.
As shown, today's society as well as in ancient times is based on the unreasonable preference of its own advantage, without having to pay attention to overall societies.
Private capital is not already able from its nature to recognise and implement the advantage of the entire society.
The result today, as was then, is an unprecedented decade of the elites, who do not in the least strive for deeper reforms.
The cause for the emergence of fascism and communism, therefore, we must look for the unconsiderable liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today's state, the fall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracy can be regarded as a certain break, in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are faced with the losses of hundreds of thousands of people's lives, humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, and with crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and newer history.
The abolition of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systematic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state's capital participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: laboratories of chaos.
"... that nothing could come from violence or ever arise," sings Sting in the song fragile, whose most important verse is in the refrain: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are" .
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would not be any," says the dying goodie Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, a number of reactions.
The one stands behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense, while calling the Palestinians as terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed to the Palestinian Arabs, and calling the state of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is in this repeated wave of killer debt and who is victims; in the end, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-administration areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
I am about to open the readers the view behind the scenes, the view of who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot land in the Middle East is most important.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and come from my own understanding of who or which group of people affects the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make up a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question whether it was really always these personalities themselves, who made their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne someone who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must recognize that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power did not arise within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomical-rich families, a special feature is one that could be described as the head of the crack (I don't know whether there's someone else about them, but I don't lock this out) - the Rothschilds.
A lot is not written about her.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschild in the 90s of the 19th century to disconnect their name with high-criminal acts, in whose background the fortification of their power, the increase of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are carrying out wars or equipping them (they were 7 countries before the attack on Afghanistan, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis remained only four, while Russia in the meantime undermined its Central Bank to the Russian Government).
Anyone who tried to oppose this family had to pay for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to publish its own banknotes (speaking state) during the civil war and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to release its own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Member Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to claim the FED for the resolution of the World Economic Crisis in 1929.
The global desires of the Rothschilds led to the formation of a plan for the decoupling of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33th and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, in particular through the second war, the colonial rule of Great Britain should be broken, and the third war is to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a such number would provide for their amenities and luxury and would also not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the forefront) and ultimately lead to the adoption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of richest families works with the Rothschilds is the solution of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see FED's founding so that crisiss such as those caused by them do not repeat in 1907).
After they were able to trigger the First World War by the murder of the Habsburg Thronefolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Zarium by the revolution of Bolsheviks.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economic unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zar Empire was no longer necessary), and then the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to make it easier for the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politics to create a late conflict situation by putting Germany with gigantic war repairs, creating the prerequisite of poor masses, so that they had to underjudge only a sufficiently strong leader who offered the debts and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-popular state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should take the function of a fifth column and also take in order to eliminate the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, at which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first conflicts with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was losing himself from the chain at which the international bankers had held him at first, or whether everything had been planned, it is hard to estimate, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps was at all the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the vocation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focus for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will succeed in defeating this war, the Jewish people will be victimized in the front line of the Second World War, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge lab, a source of dispute and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also international (one can only think of how sharply people are divided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with at the beginning the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, make the choice of their own candidates.
The present prime minister of Israel, the Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascist-injured politician who loyally devotes international bankers, who is doing everything in order to develop a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in the Shangay Organisation for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly extend to a global conflict, and in which, because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, over which 20% of global petroleum deliveries run, could come to a destruction of the world economy.
In what light the words David Rockefellers from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is a all-experienced crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of men and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristokrates.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to subdue this being of total control.
"And it makes that the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a sign to their right hand or to their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign, name of the beast or number of his name.
Here is wisdom, whoever has understanding, consider the number of the beast.
For it is a number of men, and its number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the crashed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the US after the revolution, who had preserved the patronate over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the sham overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the trust of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not able to make the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow for the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent Fiasko made everything worse in the violent attempt of hostage liberation.
The diplomats taken were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been carried out by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages invoked at home a wave of solidarity as well as anti-Irian moods.
The debakel in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan at the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the US a small partial victory.
Soon before the message was occupied, six ambassadors managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to bring refugees from Iran, helping them to discover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passes as members of a film stab that supposedly visited a science fiction film in the country.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to be credible, articles on this film project appeared in specialist journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Fleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one side, he is a realistic political thriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the history of a successful Husar piece such as the Film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one side the documentary scenes from Teheran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and lightly sprayed, come.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA Central and other institutions - men in suits on the meeting table, on the office hallway, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable reboot of his career.
From a smiled actor, he has become a respectable director, and he is now no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film after the Crimea No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that does not play in the heimous Boston of the director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that lifted the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywoods.
However, Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Teheran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have actually taken place - the opening sequence of the initial arrogance of the message is very impressive in its overview, and still gives the feeling of confusion and indispensability that occurs when somewhere the story moves.
A similar effect is achieved with his team in fictional scenes (the false film staircase on a basar in Teheran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to consider that history does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
With the few, however, he works quite successful, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always work so elegantly (the scenes in which the threatening crisis on the airport in Teheran is turned off by a phoneat in America, or even the persecution hunting on the start track, will have some effect).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide spread, which is required by the need to show too much in action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood coworkers, but their figures would have earned more space, and so they are not alone in the movie.
Fleck's film loses a bit of train force. It is a film that can be tracked with some interest, with the design and the retro-style remembering on a thriller from the 70th year.
But enthusiasm is difficult.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is alive to this day and as evidence of the ideas of the all-mighty and all-knowledging secret services, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for blowing balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who annually calls out a survey on the most absurd bank charges, decided this year to organise the competition "Absurd Regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the recent EU plan introduced us to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares for the organisation of this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the approximation of the insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding imposition of bioethanol to fuels which are naturally damaging in their consequences, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the Directive on the size of chicken cages, which this year cost the eggs significantly.
In the past, criticism also reiterated the factual prohibition of the use of the term "botteraufstrich" or also the ban on sale for conventional bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparat often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry whose demands are generally represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, Czech Republic is currently trying to apply the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobby's interests were also behind the need for bananas of the highest trading class in the EU to be at least 14 cm long and not to be "cumber anomalia".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that they merely harmonize the unified national standards that would impede trade.
The standards regarding fruit and vegetables have already been veiled by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation last year, which, according to air balloons, must be indicated that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred to an American study that, according to air balloons, is the leading cause of child-sickicking death.
A similar limitation has already been applied for children up to 14 years in the use of annual market bouquets.
Kuriose accidents are also available at home
It is also relatively absurd that a directive affecting European officials themselves - everyone who is officially engaged in the EU may not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Form Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economys Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU regulation on the scope of food supplies in the field of a Member State.
The EU thus established the maximum amount of food stocks allowed on the day of our accession to the Czech Republic.
Czechia then exceeded, for example, the determined volume for mushroom conservation, which threatened us to pay a high penalty.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for having no sea, or by the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were, of course, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will apply to the EU's refund," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest was very high and that the state warehouses were overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, the EU, according to Palace, should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.
The European Commission finally met Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender on the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
Promotions for requests for grants offered the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which should be in particular for the establishment of funding applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations in the Member States are easy to target criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, some experts consider more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration but which have been forced in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also highlight the fact that Czech Republic has to fight the right to use specific designations of traditional products, and does not always win this fight.
Although after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic could defend the name "Olomoucké tvarūžky", the Inlandrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition has returned to us until the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The name rum may only be used for sugar tube distillate products, not for sugar beet products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the Parmaschinkens also appear in the Karlsbader Zwieback, Karpfen from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer Hopfen.
With an EU trade mark, the Pardubic Lebkuchen or Hořicer roles can grow.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, what is the idea of candidateing for the President's office?
It's not about me to be a senator or president.
If everything was going to work in our country without problems, I wouldn't have any chances.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves run freely, while people are increasing taxes and pension age.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I'm over 40 years old, independent and partyless, I have no other way to influence things than to candidate for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you did it and then made yourself on the way to the castle.
Don't you turn your electors back?
I told myself all the time that I would take up the battle for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would be candidate for the President's office if I was chosen as a senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument that I can achieve my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and as much mandate as possible.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a people shrink in the kneipe and in front of the TV, but make up everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media that want to rob you of honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was claimed that I would buy journalists or that I was consultant of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The struggle for the castle has taken you up over 20 million crowns with the these of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive statements of assets.
You need to change laws.
As President, you have no competences in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can introduce legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I used to keep the guide a free business, and this could be done.
The problem is the small-spiritual policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without leaflets and party dogmas from each party.
Do you see yourself more right or left as a human in politics?
From a Czech point of view, people seem to see me on the left.
For me, this right-left sense is totally unimportant.
For me, it's important that we go on.
I don't care whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you Populists.
But don't you confirm what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And this is what you want to approach.
This can be called popularism, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you will only remain words.
And that is why you do not come far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people for a long time, you will succeed, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side to implement these objectives.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call the Presidents of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally anchoring the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And then the addressed would have to say, if so, why they reject this.
A strong personality pointing to wrongs can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, who was a deserve of public pressure.
I'm quite clear that I'm an amateur; I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it does not work, I will return to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura was supposed to save Czechia.
I'm not a Savior.
I know I'm not doing anything on my own, so I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don't want to be a candidate for the Senate too.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, but he refused to work because of overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered fraud in trade with light heating oil.
I started my candidateship with the prerequisite that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the constituents have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone usually elected representatives of the establishment.
We're only two independents in the senate.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayor and district leaders.
Do you think about the establishment of a private party?
I haven't yet thought about this because I have no time to check the past of any potential party member and even have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about statements of assets, how do you look?
I appreciate my private assets at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a plot of 25 million, a apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, and an aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about one million, and then I have a few million on the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child dream - James Bond always liked me how he was driving in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and don't have money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money don't want to invest in it.
That's not just convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make debts?
I've put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably does not raise too much interest.
And I'm not obliged to fight the campaign from my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live from the senator content alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be able to take a chance for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your outcome?
Didn't you say you're going to drive back these activities?
But that does not depend on the height of the salary.
As promised, I went back some of my activities.
For example, my alternate will become Managing Director of the Travel Office in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What monthly income were you used as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the case.
As President, however, I would put my own initiatives in full.
You can find the full conversation in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of spijkeres and the recently built books' mountain - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passant on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "But, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we still need to do today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No human is still going voluntarily to one of these old-style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a barely visiting sleeping city in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000 residents community has the lowest education rate in all of the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictional bridges represented on the euro bills as pretty painted steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city's fathers realized that there was only one way to become the statistics: a library had to come!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam Architecture Office MVRDV, master of magnificent bar charts and producer of funny, yes often cynical buildings, took the matter with habitual releasing and appeared to the Competition Hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grinn in the face.
And while the jury was still contaminated around and occupied with the axles, the frequent maas stacked his reading of size to a pyramid and finished his actionistly undermined speech with the words: "Dear municipality!"
So he is, my proposal for the Bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros of expensive mountains are scattered.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground garage, supermarket, postal and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bookberg was awarded with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the fascinating small town retorte, which had no longer to offer until date as a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unseenly ugly town hall behind which white facades would be inclined to suspect a moletry factory to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: bookeldorado under cheeseeglocks.
There is an elevator that leads through the mountain mass, but the true room and reading joys are concluding when the topography is climbing.
The roughly glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned sounder floor and the elegant street latters speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You're already looking forward to Parkbank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally the book shelves are standing along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic space configuration on our head and stole the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the bookberg is skillfully used: In the middle there are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology centres.
A special joy are the black book shelves that are once wall clothing, once breasts, once stitching countries.
Optics, haptics and smell are strange.
Even infiltrated architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so we found a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Friesland farm one day.
For many years, in the Netherlands, a millimeter-dünned plastic sheet has been used as a root floor in farmhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, afterwards it's mature for the locking waste.
For the library, the Vlies - for the first time in these quantities - was printed to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Agricultural Plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bite to new cars and a bite to sports shoes.
After 105 stages you reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long hike you will be rewarded in the literature café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and potted ficus trees.
They provide for atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donate for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is a show project in puncto ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with ground heat.
Although the bookberg is under a glass turtle, the sun itself appears only shortly inside on sunny days.
The broad wooden limbs, which stand across to the glass façade, serve as a treasure and take off a large part of the sun's radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Done the rest of the rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptician from the IT industry, already dared the way to the new booklet.
Lisette Verhaig was already here.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Buchenberg as a spijkenis's "last overdue soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to spend a book from his personal stock.
This is intended to fill the optical gaps in the yet not fully fitted library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has come up.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just a Zierde.
MVRDV has thus succeeded that king's discipline, which is called identity foundation in the specialist year.
Spijkenisse wrote literature history.
As young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally a point of approach for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a greater role"
Germany voted on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin balances this in a narrow diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the request for a observer status of the Palestinians to the United Nations.
But then Berlin was.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of its special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I believe it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence, however, without being too critical of Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also included the voice when it was about setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally carried out by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just transforming its foreign policy away from a policy that was, as it were, managed by the US, to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to add that the Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are faced with the fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still touching their role, but they are on the way to a "normaler" foreign policy.
An external policy as they have France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests which are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are in a certain degree different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First of all, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to take the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries in mind.
That's a matter of fact.
But I wouldn't want to add too much weight to this, that's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA by incorporating important decisions, for example in voting on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the USA there is a great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even engage in some respect.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the US has clearly expressed a veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
Because of the American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama is probably in secret with a lot of understanding of the European position.
However, because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so brightly enthusiastic with Netanjahus politics.
Does Germany find it difficult to agree its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand, and on the other hand the position of the main partners in the EU?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and instead must drive things out of their own position.
They're just doing that with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they need to play an independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself in the role as an important international player - does Germany want to take a major role at all?
Or does Germany still find the leadership role difficult?
Germany is still not accustomed to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the Eurocrisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti-German feelings will be released.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
This is how Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be embarrassed for various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European policy is steadily diminishing, but the EU does not fill at the moment of this vacuum, who else remains there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes it much more unloved - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What, though, is Armani Polo?
Thereafter, a officially registered name is hidden in China, but it has nothing to do with the company of origin.
Nevertheless, she enjoys protection as long as the real name makers do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they get right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in the Taylor Wessing law firm, specializing in violations of rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have some additional letters so that they can register their brands.
Thus, from Gucci you simply get Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations from the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company was able to protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that was also used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese world champion in copying and injured intellectual property is known.
In the large cities there are multistory shops that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he does, on the other hand, assume that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a trailer brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who have a lot of rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt
"That's business damaging, you have to fight it," asks Pattloch.
"The brand is washed, the all setting disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and the process costs of the sectors concerned include millions, especially in the case of expensive procurement products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is with a volume of EUR 15 billion in the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, deletes of dubios entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can move with uncertain outcomes.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court refused proceedings because after the long term of the claimed name had become the "marketity".
If the plaintiff has pech, he must even pay money to the plagiator because he injured his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a dispute with Sany, the construction machine manufacturer, who recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use a emblem similar to the Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded of BMW; the dispute was simplified, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any fault.
The CTMO branding office in Beijing admits that there have been bottlenecks there in 2010 because of low personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, it was "returned to normality from the emergency situation in the work run".
Thus the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 claims are still waiting for execution in the office.
On the other hand, it costs a lot
As often as in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were received in the CTMO, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record and meant that China is launching the list of new applications around the world for the tenth time in turn, the Authority shall notify.
This also applies to the stock of all valid brands, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan had been taken on fees.
Simplified means that each registration costs on average 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, a multitude costs, as the case of the German family company shows Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal factory was lifted off imitated motor vehicle parts.
But the imitator continued to secure Chinese rights at the Mark Freudenberg.
They have not been able to protect family names in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO also rejected the argument of the Munich.
While Freudenberg was right in the next two instances, the opponent continues to fight until today.
You have to be alert
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident of bringing the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely difficult and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be counted, the company archive even had to search through one hundred years old documents to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg of the opposite offered in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"There you can see how much it is worth us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to swap back to Europe.
Then, if Imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long been abandoned by the Group, but he could not register.
"You have to watch hard," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners should "all that is somewhat protective, also register in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise this can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject in the last act of his brand drama, then you might have to pay the opposite license fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Saturday: Stamping, singing, help
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS waisen are looking forward to it.
The history of a connection that exceeds far more than 8733 kilometres.
First, there is the stamp: Cowboys boots, basketball boots, lady pumps and men's lipper looking for the tact on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-two-three-four.
Then the vocals of the singers slowly twist - old, bass, tenor and soprano - intrude, betray, and follow.
And Foot Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his merciful wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi testes a new song.
The fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and it also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken of 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Aid
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people around the world, which estimates Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 Aid waisen live.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS waisen in the village of Esitjeni, the association has found Voices for Africa Paten in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a patrol.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu storytellers or also praisers.
The bantu language can not speak fluently in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been exercising songs in this foreign soft language and brings them back from where they originate: in the south of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice of the German chores.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2000 people live there, some still in simple chimney and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have been established to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, in the small part of what is ill in Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male presence, which proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immune weakness virus to die with mid-thirty-six is not rare.
On a common African journey in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the imbongis saw many children on the streets, not only lacking parental care, but simply all: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to make him a warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa", who has since almost professionally cared for the AIDS whales in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI include Syphilis, Chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhea).
Common viral STI are HIV, Human Pappilomavir, Herpes genital or hepatitis.
Filzläuses and crates belong to the parasitary STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and Tripper are especially present in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Cook Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all Syphilis cases reported in Germany are transferred through sexual contacts between men.
In the heterosexual adults Chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidosis, trippers and human pappilomavirs are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is comparatively small among heterosexual adults - however, about 20 percent of HIV new infections are due to this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
Human papilomavirs are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
According to the Robert Cook Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has declined since 2007.
There were around 2700 cases in 2011.
That's about a tenth less than a year before.
What symptoms indicate sex disease?
Infection diseases may cause pregnancy in the genital area, urination disorders, excess, undermine pain as well as blows or wars.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer a hundred percent protection.
For partly, ignorants of sexually transmitted diseases can also be distributed through lubricant infections and close body contacts.
Therefore, experts recommend regular investigations, especially in the case of frequent changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most of the STI can be healed and late followers can be avoided.
Through patronships, donations and, not least, the Gagen that sings the choir throughout Germany, there is a number of things coming together.
"In total we have sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and persistent woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also cares about the beings being well undergoing, about one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphanages, give them a roof above their heads, and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms every day in time to school.
Anyone who has no more comes to the protective house of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as the two cookers who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organisation PSI that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not obvious, because, as obviously, the disease is all over the country, it is silent to die.
A King with 14 Wifes
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually, strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this stately sanctioned form of life is due to the rapid spread of the HI virus over the past decades.
But also the many hiking workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would be at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels all two, three years together through the south of Africa and sings songs full of wrath, struggle spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many still know on the southern zipper of the black continent from seasons of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but also some grim border soldiers have already muted a few tears.
The trip also leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their pedestrians.
Even if you hardly find the small village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni river.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 km airline to Heidelberg, to the steaming singers in the sample room on the Bergheimer Straße, you can see it illuminated there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Merkur
The Sense Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Merkur.
The ice ceiling may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Authority NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although the sun is nearest, there are frozen waters there, as is shown in three studies published on Thursday in the magazine "Science".
The Sense Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice ceiling in the planet's permanently shadowed region.
This is intended to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that have been hit on the Merkur.
But no one brings the discovery of ice into line with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger sons, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Merkur can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth's citizens, seeds, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are trying to explore the depths of the world's all.
From time to time, they send pictures to Earth: Small gambling holes in infinite pastures.
The picture comes from a camera that has developed German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who screams around the sun behind Neptun, Ceres is not a "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This picture section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars are to be identified as blue points, harder to identify the pink "newborn" in the star circle room.
This staring region - called by scientists unromantic W5 - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This shilling glow of a dying star has taken up the Spitzer telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star slipped out in the death process.
In the huge Trifid Nebel, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The Spitzer telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galactic burial.
The Plejaden star hop, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the mere eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebel looks forward to the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star image.
His similarity with an earthly continent introduced this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How these were created is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturn-Mond, which disappeared spurlessly 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool galaxie
Depending on coloring, pictures of spiral galaxies become true art works.
The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebel, several thousand light years away, in the constellation of Schütze.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three divided, three-splits), since dark dust stripes three parts of the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of Snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the forbiddens of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two merging galaxies to each other and will inevitably collide together.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy of M83.
For those who are not technical abbreviations, it may call them at their nickname Southern Firecycle.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows an excerpt from the Irisnebel in the constellation of Kepheus.
The 1400 light years away fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image has been combined from optical and X-ray recordings of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, took up the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxie calls scientists UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way is located in this galaxy.
The star size always produces new youngsters.
These star wools, associated with the rosette nebula, also produce new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only created shortly after the Urknall when mostly hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our insights into the All: The most important telescopes
The telescope was supposed to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 – before Galileo Galilei used it to observe stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become increasingly larger - and the insights they provide are increasingly deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows views into the All equally over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone the mirror comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its movability.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its speciality: the high luminous force.
This is enough - despite comparatively low mirror diameter - to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to the All after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), each computer owner can help by providing computing performance.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all honor.
With its total four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned on the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is intended to contain satte 42 meters - and consists of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest of 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which looks in the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope is supposed to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired at an illustration.
However, the main impressions from the All provide space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, there have already been pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolary planets - mainly for those inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been established since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture the last initial preparations are documented at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot at the earliest of 2018 on board a Ariane5 rocket into the all.
The primary mirror of the space infrarotlescopic has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Urknall.
Scientists assume that there is also at the southern pole of Merkur ice.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the messenger screams far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been suggesting for decades that there is ice on the Merkur.
Through the messenger-sounds launched in 2004 - the first to scream around the Merkur - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and get 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A track search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A track search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The ride through the Talysch mountains is called wildromantic.
The small bus rushes over the curve-rich road, passing by densely forested hills, rising rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here the Caucasian People's Group of Talyans lives, which is not much known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserian and is very durable.
Endstation is Lerik.
The small town is pronounced with too greatly ratified architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
Tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, too difficult is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometres you need eight hours because the road is only one-spure.
The magnificent wealth that the land owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous in May with the Eurovision song festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented from about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
One child born at the age of 136
However, controversial star of the museum is the sheep shirt of Müslümov, which is supposed to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age appears very doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he was supposed to have witnessed a daughter.
So did ıirali Müslümov count for a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, aged researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the high-aged people in Central Asia.
"There are a lot of old people in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, many very old men live."
However, because of lack of documents, there should be no scientific evidence of age, since the register of persons was missing.
Every day cheekly melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years of age.
So why are there so many high-aged people in the south?
The Aserian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes it was in the diet.
But that the calorie-rich food of talyans should be so healthy, that meat, bread and mostly milk products love and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not seem plausible from nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Kaukasus region.
She's sitting on the ground with a butterfly, which she rolls and rolls intimately.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayevas' sons and one daughter, both are long grandparents.
Two young children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen you can prepare the guests tea that is served in the typical, building-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth stand perfectly in mature and glid, under her headcloth she hides long, dark blonde cuffs that proudly reveal her son before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out to me and kept her color.
"I never used Shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is sufficient for life
She's always eaten what came from her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, inheritance.
I haven't bought food for all my life in the supermarket for one time.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the time after World War II.
But everything became better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took the rower.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the patriarch of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
By 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the rower.
After all, there is no need for Azerbaijan's old people.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions a amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps also Mirzayevas has long sincere sons: "The old ones enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the grand family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalizing congestions in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Scharia as a base is severely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not walk with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds, lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially to the Christian Koptes, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly crushed in a confusion opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of Grace of the powerful Muslim brotherhood.
According to Mohammed Mursi, he almost apologized, temporarily circumcised the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competences, "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctoral title of the US University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are about it, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be defeated?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been pierced by the islamist-dominated 100-country Constitutional Assembly in a nightly 15-hour parforce rit, are partly anxious.
As in previous Constitutions, it is also stated in the draft, the legal basis for the "Principles of Islamic Law".
But what does "Principles" mean?
It was and is interpretation matter and it is fearful that Islamists will use the swam formulation and the resulting legal scope for a more strict interpretation of the Scharia.
This suggests at least a new article: In all the Scharia matters concerned, the Al-Ashar University has to be advised, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiation in the entire Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be, but it can mean that the clergy supervises legislation, which de facto would have resulted in the reconciliation of the judiciary.
A lot in the draft draft is interpretation
Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction should continue to maintain.
These courts served to suppress opposition cells during Mubarak's reign.
After the death of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military prison.
The State should also protect "the true being of the Egyptian family" and promote its morality and values.
This is legally so unsharpened that state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature using this article.
In the plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly defines the equality of men and women.
For this, another forbids to offend or blaspheme the prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it is to be called, remains unclear.
Likewise, dubios encourages the wording that the "pleading of men" is prohibited.
Is there already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Explanatory matter, as much as will be presented to the Egyptians in the draft which Mursi has been signed and, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the vote of the People's Party.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming against the overpower of Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in uncommon agreement on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and praised to bring the Charter to fall before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential elections.
Peace Nobel Prize winners and ex-chief of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the Constitutional Draft belongs to "the Müllberg of History".
Through brief news service Twitter, he accused the adherents of Mursis to lead a "people against democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and crash him," said the opposing Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been suffocated," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chalde Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood blies on their part to the area demonstration, but not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer in front of the Cairo University.
Many of the women and followers of the Salafists took part in this and called: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Mursi, "Säuber the land!" and they regretted, "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolized Tahrir square, where everything began, would probably have been contending with civil war-like conditions.
That was obviously not what Mursis followers wanted to risk.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the Constitutional Draft and the advocates would have expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now the time is to let the people decide on the electoral course in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of Islamists is considered safe.
"The word of human rights is not even happening"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process, which should actually have gone up to February and have all social forces involved.
The 48-year-old human rights attorney and Chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were in prison under Mubarak or in court.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For that, he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's power expansion to all three forces in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto puts it out of force," Saeda complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels alone, also by the international community, who looks at the ideological direction fight on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "You are giving a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the world's most vulnerable fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but all around the world.
Could the country's secrecy of success have something to do with the local appetite on quite fragile fish?
You take a selection of overrider cheese varieties.
You place them in the middle of a hole of dirty, wet sports clothing.
And call her there for a week.
This is about the way you need to imagine the nasty smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicates.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is with salt-berated forelle, which - depending on how you would like to stink its fish - is fermented in water up to a year.
When the darkness comes across the country in Norway and the weather becomes colder, Norweger flows to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very affordable specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire guard, but as a so-called "Rackfisk General", also organizes the festival.
People around us eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can push the smell.
I cost some chops.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk in nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a quite long bus trip behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, far more poor Norwegian epoch when there were no cooling facilities yet and fish was drowned in airproof salt water barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after long fermentation and consumed - no doubt with the aid of alcohol - senses.
Another generation before, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mainly moved to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who had not been far richer for too long than Norway, emigrated immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, though strictly ripening part of Norwegian history.
It's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a little glass of beer or a sandwich costs pride 10 euros.
Norway does not often create it into the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here it is still hated to name Anders Breivik – those racist legal extremists, the last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead, it refers only to the incident of July 22th.
Nor do they hard to accept that someone in their peace - loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why it is so good for us," says Anna, our cellar, distributed the round tablets with mature Rakfisk and embodied the Nordic ideal with its long blonde hair and the steaming blue eyes.
We are one - as you say - careful people.
Your English is just like most people here makelless.
We're not very venerous, we don't like prahlery.
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years until the world economic crisis, all of them were thrown around with money they did not even possess, Norway held his stock exchange firmly.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and walk in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat Rakfisk," she adds with uncomfortable laughter.
I'm standing in the snow and standing for another dishes - I have enough from Rakfisk.
So an elevator is definitely something different, and the juicy meat murmurs me.
But in the evening, the stinkfish is on the food plan again.
The hotel, where I log, is one of several events that organise a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most demanding smelling - fish.
There is a live TV session to a showmaster clothed with fly, surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're knocking and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict thinness of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is faced with difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his arrival in office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is very bad.
Even in better days, this is an ever-stopped city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks up several important road routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disturb pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bond and take over the leadership of the nation.
He is faced with a complex task.
Under the separating government, Felipe Calderons has been able to consider Mexico economically well, but the country is in the control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nieto at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week to U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he went to the U.S. president, Pena Nieto was a governor of his home-state Mexico.
In this densely populated, widespread part of the country that surrounds the capital, the opinions are divided about the new Head of State.
A direct man
In the remote town Valle del Bravo, for example, you like to remember him.
Residents of the resort write to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the motorways that had Pena Nieto built and represent a great improvement to the fragile, holply streets that once existed here.
Plakettes with their name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and persistent changes from him," said his friend and political allies Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a Congress Deputy for the Pena Nietos Party, the PRI.
In particular, what security and economy are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress Deputy Olvera admits that after 12 years, the party has made great expectations to Enrique Pena Nieto outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos.
The accusations of opposition, the new President, lacking substance, he refuses.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent stateman, but he is, above all, also a listener.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transitions and in many respects represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year the military was forced to fight the drug bands operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large garbage deposit, the bodies of dozen murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is noted for their violence and murders of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not dealt with the problem of women's murders during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete construction, typically for the falling quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her companion.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed that her body washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body bar had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana looks down on us. It is fitted next to a cross that wears one word: justice.
But exactly these, according to the family, they have been denied until now.
The authorities treated me as if I were a sweater, intrusion founder, nörgler.
They just want you to accept their judgment and keep your mouth.
"But that is not possible if there were so many form mistakes and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's commitment on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been involved in violence in the last six years, and the new President has promised to take particular care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is as a governor," says PRI Congress Deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of it.
The prosecutor claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecutor contradicts Bradley Manning's accusation that he had been abused in prison
The hearing relates to Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
Defense seeks to reject the accusation due to tough detention conditions
The freed of the US Army is accused of having taken away thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecutor tried to find that the army-freed Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest uncovering of confidential information of American history - failed to complain about the allegedly suffered abuse in military prison.
In a cross-excuse Mannings during a prejudicial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents for weekly visits that prison officials had made during Manning's nine-month detention period in Quantico, Virginia did not have any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross trial, which was held as a result of an application of defense for rejection of the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard detention period - Manning had declared that he had considered suicide in prison.
The United States Army's secret service analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stolen thousands of confidential documents in Iraq during his service time.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein with Manning went through the forms that officials had filled with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had been imprisoned under increased detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When he asked the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, said Fine, contained no complaints about abuse, although the officials inquired of Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns orally, and the officials would have discussed them with him and indicated that they should be concerned with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote up (after meeting the concerns) "No problems," and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything," said Manning.
The judge, Captain Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011, which should examine the suicide thought he mentioned several months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status to prevent injuries.
The military said that it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is one step under the risk of suicide - to his and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that it was good for me, and get rid of the status of observation to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning announced his arrest and detention to Kuwait, where he was held about two months before he was transferred to the prison of the Marine Base Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he thought of suicide and had once become conscious because of the heat.
Not to know what was happening to him or to the outside world has been burdensome.
"My world shrinked on Camp Arafjon, together on this cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was only allowed a mattress, a ceiling, flip flips, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because the day it had been forbidden to sleep or just lay down.
He always had to sleep with light, which came from outside into his cell.
If he turned around at night and he couldn't see his face anymore, he was awakened so that he turned back.
In January 2011 Manning's lawyer formally opposed the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011 Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked for an accusation that he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he slept a night naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in a morning counting before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had said that during this counting he had never had the opportunity to hover with his ceiling.
At the survey on Friday, Manning announced that he had closed out of a command of his guard that he should have dropped the ceiling with which he could have covered. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had told him that he was forced to sleep naked during the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger for himself.
Manning said to the official that he could have used the covenant of his lower pants or his flips to injure himself, but not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip flips and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his detention, he should be condemned in his trial before the military court, which is set up for the beginning of the next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will confess himself to a lesser crime for guilty, while other accusations which are considered too extreme are to be contested.
The hearing is continued for this weekend. The prosecutor is expected to justify the imprisonment conditions.
The Pentagon remains at its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held under the highest safety arrangements in Quantico.
The accusations against Manning include the enemy's beneficiary, unlawful publication of secretary information on the Internet, the transmission of national defense information and the stealing of public property or documents.
If he finds guilty in all charges, he threatens a lifelong penalty.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexican tends to accuse the emigrants - they call them hard times to remember, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed through the hall and had arrived at the passport control when counsellessness spread into me.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" (Mexikaners), another for "Extranjeros" (“extranjeros”).
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure to whom I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexikaner" for all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italyans".
Later, I decided for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for shortcuts or stripes.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I'm not lying about the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I'm not going to get rid of my American accent too.
So I took my American passport and put me in the snake for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for Mexicans to remain in Mexico with equally high probability today, instead of migrating to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block according to the model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cards, even if he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentiment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States was in Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under prescribed gun to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
So as soon as a US government officer exercises only the mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears complaints about how the Americans are threatening the sovereignty of their neighbouring country in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the path of war.
But the biggest challenge of Mexico is in fact in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about ressentiments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - was not given a chance in Mexico and migrated to the north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - darkhearted, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, have visited good schools and have received good jobs, we should never forget that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but what affects our loyalty is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as a reminder of a humble defeat and look down at us because we are not mexic enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough to never be strong enough our bands to Mexico.
In her opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families didn't fail in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we would not now see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child legally migrated to the United States, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans there are tensions because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans take this to them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they do not belong to the one or to the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them is rooted.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as a Mexican.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of education want to resume their connections to diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional "bothkeeper" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and pressure on the political leadership to intensify their bonds to Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unrighteous distribution of income, unrestrained corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a year and a half ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were not treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're "mexican" as I thought.
Old Fighting, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected base for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were laid in shoes and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time missiles from Gaza were beaten near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these distresses.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to assume that the deadly Patt situation could finally end.
A war that is not lost or won
At first glance, optimism seems to be anything different in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, these weekly fights strengthened the hard-bounds on both sides.
The leader of the Hamas, the Islamist movement, which has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, is claimed to have pushed the Israelis back, even though its grouping itself had to record great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are carved into one of the desolateest and denseest corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy the Hamas until now.
In fact, the Hamas in West-Jordanland, which is controlled by the rival, gentle Palestine group of Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, the Hamas have been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a renewing regional power, once considered Israel's closest Muslim alliance, has taken for the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic golf states.
Joying Hamas hangers believe that Israel is a Islamic half-moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the military Hezbollah has the power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamic prey could stand before the storm of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas associations threaten the king.
In particular, the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most inhabited and most important Arab country - at the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the Lizist Despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had only a little time left for the Hamas.
On the other hand, the brotherhood with the Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States itself.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, make a contrary conclusion.
The Hamas is no longer a danger in military terms.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has been able to assess and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is firmly observing its position, and many European countries have made the Hamas responsible for the latest violence scales.
Israel has been good in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process too largely.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israeli since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide killers - not least thanks to the blocking plants that have been invaded in the West-Jordanland and thus in the main part of any Palestinian state. However, they continue to protect the Jewish settlements which have been declared unlawful to the people.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud party joined an even more fighting group in the front of the elections on January 22, under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why also do these behindlisted Palestinians shake and leave them a state of their own?
If they really had control over the West Jiordan country, would they not, like their fellow fighters in the Gaza Strip, also fire missiles?
No, it's better to hold them behind the wall and punish them, they should dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to carry out, but the Arab spring could make them a trick through the invoice.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense set of Israel is greater than that of his four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that the pragmatic President Mursi joined Barack Obama in order to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking steady steps towards democratization, Palestinians will continue to be robbed of their self-determination law - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied areas, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression already undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only intensify.
Blood missions to withdraw Hamas in Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a drive from outside
The correct answer is those represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and this newspaper: two states in which Israel represents territories for security purposes.
The hope - for the near future - is that the ceasefire of arms outsiders will give more influence to the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop arms deliveries in the Gaza Strips and is better positioned than ever before to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by territorial baggage and a common Jerusalem.
Outstanding Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have been done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than for the upcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute its part to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own plan of peace.
Far away in the white house it seems as if he was abandoned.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States have an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and suffered body parts on neutral green packs equal to all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for single cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia. This will replace brand logos and colors with neutral, olive green covers, which are also printed with drastic images, which show sick body parts and infants and children who are ill and smoked by cigarette smoke.
Apart from the various health warnings and images, the only difference between the packs in the brand names that are printed in the same, small font is from the coming Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the world's strictest rules for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to remove young people from smoking by removing the glamourous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not started at 26 will no longer start with 99% probability afterwards.
"You can already see that children of young age understand the message of applying tobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. They quoted studies that for example showed that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the least smokers in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trade, which leads to cheaper and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws curbed their business.
Sandra Ha by Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarettesetuis and silicone caps has grown enormously to cover the inaccessible packaging since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the top Australian court with its fight against the laws.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and waited for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, hooks in the popularity of social media are among the people to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws banned tobacco companies from TV advertising to prevent them from appearing as sports sponsors and forced most traders to stop cigarettes in business. Now tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites but has no influence on international sites.
"Who marketed tobacco and left only a small area to apply its products does not get around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, researcher in health at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands written by "all normal people".
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private person who finds such a great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, industry concentrates on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new regulations - these countries are complaining about improper restrictions on trade, although none of the countries is engaged in greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted discussions with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001, which prescribed photographic warnings.
Now they have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves profoundly.
The pictures do not affect me.
I'm just ignoring her.
"You just take a kip and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the single packaging has made it difficult to fill up its shelves.
"Before I used an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should just have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have told ourselves okay, that's it, we're close," he obviously adds.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be even bored
This Thanksgiving I spent an unexpected five hours in the airport when our plane was out because of mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flyer.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts into boredom.
I don't want to lie.
A half-day waiting at the airport for a flight is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead to boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be occasionally bored.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring on some screen today, the benefits of boredom are no longer beneficial.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
That's what I'm coming back again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not think so.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long story," he says.
The house walls of Pompeji decorate a Latin graffiti over boredom that goes back to the first century.
And then there is still the question how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, a associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many kinds.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "during a satisfactory activity but not able to do so".
Long periods differ from apathy as a result that the person is not busy but wants to be.
On the other hand, in apathy there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of the boredom, he says, is in a "distortion of the attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is slowly passing".
Relaxation can sound almost as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions could be related, people felt the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have only difficulty focusing on ourselves.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - about German: "The inactive mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", which appeared in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment that listened to a band to which one person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring space that had nothing to do with the content. Others listened to low volume, so it was hardly perceived, while the third group did not hear this noise at all.
The people who heard the hardly hearable television indicated that they felt more boring than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could not find any reason for them, and admitted their difficulties of boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or efforty task, the disruption of attention to boredom can lead, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you exercise a one-tone activity - "as the search for defective products on a factory supporting band, music can deter and help not feel fatigue."
In fact, he says, we now know that herum pots and crystals, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hample around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down," says Professor Fenske.
All of us become boring at some time - my late flight, a drowning speaker, a particularly tired movie.
But some people are more boring than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scala to boredom sensitivity".
On the scale, statements such as "Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys become more boring than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at Westflorida University, in particular as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external reiz.
But in general, teenagers are a rather tense break.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment with almost 400 teenagers and their parents contacted a pager seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of the adolescents in school and in doing the homeworks were abandoned, while 23% were mentioned, if they were not in school.
However, only 3% of the parents indicated to feel fatigued.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson does not know whether the percentage of boredom has risen or decreased.
However, he is sure that "the youth will be felt particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their everyday life.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and deprived of gambling or drugs to relieve them - that has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something different," said Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do the best.
When a boring one is and this energy is used to play and cook guitar, you will be happy.
However, while television can provide for a short-term feeling of happiness, they flee again in the long term.
So, if you have an iPad, you can take it away from the boredom. However, it has not learned to talk or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Selvest control is transferred from one situation to the other."
The child not only learns to talk, but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should be celebrating boredom.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel well beyond constant activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we need to be more boring, but boredom is the painful, indefinite desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in truth are just looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it's hard to worry when the noise has been damned once."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new Marihuana Act
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a crime in the southeast of Colorados, which will soon be legal in this state: possession of some fewer marijuana breaks and a pipe with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on the way on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer had found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was preloaded for the possession of drugs and drug utilities - cavalier delicates, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court date.
"We are treated as criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one?
In the ignorant weeks following the State’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for self-use, the answer for hundreds of minor drug offenders depends less on the law than on the site.
Hundreds of irregularities that turn around marijuana are already dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer follow adults over 21 years for possession to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
However, attorneys in the more conservative districts of Colorados have announced that existing marihuana delicates continue to follow and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denvers to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from opening in their municipalities.
"This situation continues so quickly that I don't even know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And also regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are curious.
They are waiting for an orientation aid for the establishment of a license system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug and have a time limit until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that in any case, Colorado is pre-prepared by most states as regards the regulation of Marihuana. There, the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for personal consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Supervisor for Spirituosen in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a gross guide.
"We have no real precedent we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on December 6th, thus also forming the endpoint of a gray zone in which the State License System does not exist yet but is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state requirements of an "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana should be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis shops around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and children's care facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's Balling Area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent his employees in Aurora an e-mail in which he explained that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana offences in people over 21 years of age and that the police would "about immediately" not seek criminal indications for these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to implement urban regulations for farmers of medical marijuana and would continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County in North Colorados, district prosecutor Ken Buck represents a more strict view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana property, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
At present, 119 people have to be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many were also accused of other offenders.
"Our authority has the duty to persecute infringements in which it was at the time of action," said Buck in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters refused the Marihuana initiative, silent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, no longer indicate adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to let all outstanding property procedures fall.
"I don't think that I waste my time with enforcement of the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the action, from the outset it was clear that it would not be easy to harmonize the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal systems.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a deep twist among local officials in view of the great green experiment.
In the case of prosecutors of the state, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendant of Marihuanadelicte in court and acts on the spot as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives in persecuting people criminally that they are still unable to accept legalisation," he believes.
As the first countries that treat smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are acted as national pattern cases for the legalisation of drugs.
While predecessors and government officials are preparing legal sales for a age, they are also nervous waiting for instructions from the federal government, which continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a crime at federal level.
Prosecutors of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several spectacular arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuanas, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy consultant of the Obama government, believes that although criminal officials are likely to enter no doors to confiscate smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be struggling those legally regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the day of election, some local administrations approved Moratoria for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban that is probably adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this change in law.
We focus on what the community has decided and not on what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was hired from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It was always my greatest dream of getting a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once considered the largest knowledge stamp in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entrance to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - I had planned to study history - I had again packed my suitcases and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I would have gone because I had a problem with the fact that communes in the neighboring room had sex.
The author A N Wilson explained that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I was suffering from systematic pangs and threats.
Not because of my quite unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I was only shaken for one reason - a reason that seemed to be such anxious and cruel in this alleged way of illumination: My father Woodrow Wyatt, who died, was an important consultant Margaret Thatchers and I advocated the Conservative Party.
Why am I saying this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of the educated rights suffers under similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same protection of equality that benefits from pregnancy, disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College indicate that they are often actively isolated, attacked and declared unwanted because of their political views.
They require a place in the Equal Rights Committee of their College to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as an excentrician and neonazis.
It showed, among other things, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and prospered with silver suit and silver-coated walkstock.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered to be "sound arches for the introduction of higher study fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday period: "There is a growing left-hand density at universities.
People believe we're like the Bullingdon Club, without having met us at all."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and historian student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "uncomfortable". Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old president of the conservative student association of Oxford, said that she has observed a growing rejection to students of the educated rights in JCR members.
"This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
In the previous year, the university had voted to give no honor to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to cuts in the university.
The atmosphere would even have made stalinists shaken.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students came to know themselves and the tutors, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors did not only tolerate the ridicule of Tory students but even participated with joy.
Political topics such as the mining strike, privatisation and refusal of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-closed spaces of the Tutorial.
At my first events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (now died), "Please translate the first paragraph."
I stole with it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite hesitant.
"Does Thatcher-Anhangers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students kicked.
In my eyes, tears rose up.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours in your leisure time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt crowned me.
I returned to my room with hanging head.
That evening, I was sitting at college alone at dinner when someone sucked me on the shoulder.
It was an English student named James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately it is as it is.
Everyone who is suspected of being Tory is being imprisoned.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher's close, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory's first semesters suggest that they be part of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I later tried to change myself.
I pointed out that I wasn't one of the opinions of Mrs Thatcher in all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A study beginner in the field of philosophy, politics and economy, who, ironically, had visited the conservative Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist wine".
You're polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They hit each other, aren't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever have been able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet the same ones only after the dark break?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me were stretching in front of my spiritual eye to a feather of distress and isolation.
The only tutor to recognize himself openly as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat at my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative but also because he advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy and had written speeches for them.
He was rare.
He hated the place, found him provincial and smallcared and refused him for his marxist determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to penetrate between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed disbelievable.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower tips.
Even my Communist friends always showed clear manners.
His moist eyes drowned.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure you're just necking.
It would break my heart if you were going.
I was exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was weakened.
One of my male friends, too, Tory adherents, gave up the pressure and dismissed his convictions.
During a tutorial in the following week, in which another story tutor seriously claimed to be "a enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was in secret in shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone me a "hern laundry," and called them "old dreck."
The relief took just a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I was hiding in my room, and after five minutes my hammers gave up.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're glad you can call me a waisty tail.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and evil in a educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but hid itself behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of mind until now.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened in London this week, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian modemacher.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer in the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of the Haute Couture have been compiled by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a history whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always experienced fascination for the sticky and remote world of the noble.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until March 3, there is a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most read aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, about Princess Marie Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social rise from the modest modem acher in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the Idol of the international jetset.
To be in love with the adel, it doesn't have to be of disadvantage.
"At least they don't get their chickens on your magnificent carpet, as it do some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all rejoiced when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charm of the modemacher.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music was recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "Top model", which began their career at the week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes..
Mode view of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of sensation, rather of mutual loves.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 meters long walking steep that suggests a rolling exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the loopstep to admire a dreamy "audience" that carries masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress, the Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, chose the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat made of wool and leather, who belonged to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, such names as the names of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg are radiated.
Naty Abascal and the Modemacher, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a West type "Gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers' museums.
"I draw him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Herzogin of Feria.
I like the colors that he uses very much; they have much light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and leaders of the fashion Patricia della Gioampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she was carrying a Valentine.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
Finally, at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine dress for a festival in my vetter's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying rock and a dragged top with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a real dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is not dependent on fashion, its possession is timeless," explains this Italian aristokratine living between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses "with absolute care," "because a dress is not just a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "König" of the fashion
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragasze" (as the modem acquaintances called) were necessary to produce this eleven-fined sewing dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four-en-a-half metres long slip.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, excellent with the honorary legion, cumulates Garavani as many honors as everyone of the husbands of his clients.
"I always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his maintained and perfect outwards," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a Gala dining at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was flawless; the time leaves no traces to him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play their lives and their health when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, stoney paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are working literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island Java.
To this end, he must rise down to the ground of his crater every day, where the gas flowing out of the earth is fastened in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the absent paths of stone.
Although there are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 metres, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle rate, keeping the balance and making their steps careful so that they do not shrink and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives as this happened by a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen deserve 5 Eurocent for each kilo of sulphur that they degrade.
On the top, they run the way between the tourists, which they photograph like circus apes and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to the scale which a mining company has set a little farther down at a height of 1850 metres
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the occurrences in the volcano since 1960 and (not better said) its workers to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo sulphur.
This sells it to the petrochemical industry for every 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the production of iron, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"As we usually wear 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) for every road," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
He needs three hours for each route, where he has been completely accomplished, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an inhuman effort is the threefold of what he would earn with field work.
"The daily wage of miners here, where 15,000 rupees are paid on the coffee harvest (1,1 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupien (6,2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I have married a girl from Bali where they are Hinduists, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hustet often and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been playing his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glass.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hustet often and his eyes are irritated from the volcano because of the toxic gases.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I'll work here for two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but penalized young man could work as a tourist leader, cellner or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of a wearing.
It divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color in the darkness is blossoming.
The shadows challenging, he rises in the light of a small forelight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, into the crater.
Approximately 400 carriers charge the baskets on the crater floor with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanised sulphur degradation to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to the carriers working on their own account and paying after weight.
They also receive no share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euro) surcharge per photo device, which the guards of this natural park, together with the amount of the entry fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) demand from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and human wearing.
"This work is for the animals and not for the human being" protests Madrusin, a steady 42-year-old institution who has been working for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, "as long as it goes," because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and juices the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and traps the miners into the thick pillars rising out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course, except the usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have deformed themselves from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with his 53 years is only able to wear 50 kg.
Each day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported from three trucks over a goat path between the building to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres.
"I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elders with his 30 years of age also work as a sulphur driver.
The time passes, but the army keeps generation to generation in one of the worst professions in the world: those who work as a human burden on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeians blame that they do not have children, on the career, stress and the costs of real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our citizenship obligation and we create life!
It seems unfaithful that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but still – or just for that reason – they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local Proverbs such as "Schieben will be a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has turned the video, observes the hope that the advertising spot is reaching in a fun way to make attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When we planted, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is a topic that we had to care for.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with phenomena or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possibly that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not force to succeed.
So we thought: Why do we not make something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1,2 children
Those who do not easily take this issue are the government of Singapore.
Every year, she spends 1,300 US dollars for political measures to encourage citizens to get more children.
A package of government for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in the southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeians get any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National Population Authority's marriage and family policy, says that this is due to "better training" and "larger career opportunities".
"This has enabled the people to marry and form a family much more options in terms of life goals and set priorities," she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of individuals and to the retirement of marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in migration in order to counteract the reduction of the population led to recessions in the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where the hardly chest Xenophobie blooms against many new migrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping low wages and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore last year has achieved its poorest electoral result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has a known impact on the economic growth of a nation, which has tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government tries to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already an impact on the housing market.
The City Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square metres and show a great sales success.
However, the concern is that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they prevent construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Real Estate Company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This leads them to be much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer orientations that were previously imposed on obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could make the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singaporens working in the financial district are to be found that they will not have a great impact.
"The people are very stressed, the apartments and the education are expensive, so it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The kids can get others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women lead to their career, stress and the cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singaporeians have the last word when it comes to getting children - there the government can do so much.
The offline private is private online
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "one area of private life, where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What's private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 who are often on the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very own" at personal level and "on the password and the user" if they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets would I not announce in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge in trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"Those are very confidential secrets, my mother must know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I load beautiful pictures or pictures of games up.
I'm spending my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that is not of me, or of someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to write obscene photos, naked photos, crimes, or insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I logged in at Twitter to express myself and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if someone answers to me, I'm just loading her up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or to friends," he says.
He asked that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown one.
Even if someone recommends him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits 20 of the people he has added to his friends list.
"This doesn't scare me because we have something common, for example, music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has made him annoying or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone stirs me or asks them of me, I just remove him from my account," he admits.
José reported himself at Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy's experiences are not unknown today as cyberbullying.
The friend of a girlfriend was expressed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never learned who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
He then explains a series of steps to establish a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would do that if he was insympathetic to me or I wanted to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher for English with university degree in education and learning, believes that to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of the social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these pages the game rules have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master title in education at Yale University, and author of the work "Digital Natives and Imigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
They are the digital natives, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we are still learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex subject, "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what is allowed to be distributed, published or said, and this in an age where the maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be selective if it is most important for them to be popular to have thousands of friends without reflecting on the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach the children and adolescents what privacy is to ask them questions that bring them to reflect.
"To say they shouldn't do it, doesn't work," he says.
Porras then calls some possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Should everyone know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to understand them that they need to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educator, commented that it is essential that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You should not speak to strangers."
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the declaration of Lima, which had been announced before and should be theoretically signed by the seven governments present.
Ephe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI. Ordential meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and presidential Chancellor initially informed that they would pass it after the Klausur, however, that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruan Government.
In the case of questions about the text, they indicated that the content was explained to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting was transferred without sound with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists were received by the press speakers of some of the unassur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which brought unpleasantness to the hundreds of journalists of different national and international media that demanded more information.
Afterwards, the Presidential Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the Humala Declaration and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru was hosted by the III Summit South America - Arabic States (ASPA), and even at this time, despite the press’s strong call, the so-called declaration of Lima, which was announced before, was just as little published.
On the official website of ASPA, you can convince you that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists would be available, but they restricted access to information to a large extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which contributes to a cross-border conflict between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH that begins in The Hague on Monday, in the process which Lima initiated against Santiago to listen to the Pledoyers of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we present to this international court," said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that is obliged to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, closes agreements and undergoes international courts," adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a hand pressure on the flags of both countries.
The two presidents have confirmed that they would submit to the IGH after Colombia had taken a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it to be a serious error, appealed against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
At the summit, the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after his President Fernando Lugo was disfellowshipped, did not participate in the meeting.
The hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit in Lima shortly after lunch.
The Head of State relied on the final document, which announced that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set over an investment amount of a total of $17 billion.
He said to the decisions taken that the countries of Unasur will "take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship to extend the decisions on residence rights."
He noted that measures would be stepped up to "improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and against organised cross-country crimes, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the case of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) cannot accept triumphing trains, but is intended to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give a number of 31 emblematic projects the priority to improve spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and conclude new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a reader declaration.
These projects include five Peruvians lying on the cross-axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are intended to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country serves for its resumation in the Union of South American nations", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourhood relations was another aspect emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before starting his participation in the regional meeting, said that on Saturday in Mexico, he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the marine conflict respectfully after a judgment of the IGH in question by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega on the morning (Sameday)," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua will also make talks with Nicaragua necessary," he underlined.
"I hope to tell President Ortega that we will be treated as civilized and respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Ministers of Defense of the Block also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which will strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defense of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter is currently excluded.
Peru has chaired at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part at the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, declared to the public television in Peru that the Europeans were "in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "is now practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that promotes the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the American States (OEA) under the prescription to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to something, and in return, we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the inter-American Committee on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as an example to the political asylum, which Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles but had fulfilled his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there had been "founded suspects that Assange would be delivered to a third country and would not comply with his procedure."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary who asked him to underwar him in his territory for a alleged sexual offence, while "swedish judiciary allowed this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out on the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that the risk is that the health and psychic condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he is in our message, I didn't talk to him, but the ambassador informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of State Ecuador.
However, it poses the risk of taking physical and psychological damage because it is trapped in a narrow space and could not carry out physical exercises in the outside.
"This would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum, which was granted since June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, was the grant of a free letter, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there were talks with London to find a solution for the jailed founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we do not apply to this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European legal authorities , because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European instances," he said.
And "When Britain gives this free letter tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange on the Embassy of Ecuador in London or about Skype, how it permits Swedish jurisprudence and in other cases the problem was done.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the medicity, the evil intention and the lies that force the free expression."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the wicked and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and express," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "or not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and spies bourgeois countries," and he prescribed that he would "develop the revolution in order to continue the way in this direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, and argued that the organism "have to remain hard, and that no opportunism and no one can take place as a legally dressed state strike" because it "destructed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of Den Hague, which favoured the Maritime State Honor of Nicaragua to negotiate the maritime borders between both countries with Nicaragua, "absolutely legitimate".
This judgment is currently not implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be fully treated so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
Similarly, he relied on a good conclusion of the disputes about the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call for international instances when both countries commit to accept the judgment even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility of being a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to reach his third mandate in succession, he indicated that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never been interested in me personally, but in such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, then I will withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment and that would be expected that he could return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in the health condition of President Chávez," he commented.
Today, the ecuadorian Head of State took part in Lima at the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death for AIDS is today too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the results of the investigation: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb fell in," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "smudge" without recognisable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such a use that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic forbid to decide, "because it led to a sackgasse."
At that time AIDS was synonymous for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come into the clinic that knows nothing about their disease and in which the virus has already damaged and has exhausted their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first cases reported, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes the treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was based in April this year by a recognized scientific publication.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of immune effects of the people's immune system at the beginning of treatment, and that those greater opportunities that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years at a counting of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a counting of 500 CD4.
Simply, the above statements mean that whoever receives HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can in this sense "probably become 75 years old as long as he is under control," said this expert.
In order to properly identify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans is an average of 76 years today.
Even if mortality has significantly decreased in recent years (in Mexico the number of people dying in AIDS has decreased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (Year Report of ONUSIDA), it is still right that 60 percent of patients in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and until May this year, there are 187 deaths, but it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- So why are people still dying?
I think the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any supply problems with the medicines. The problem is that people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a accompanying infection. To influence global mortality, early diagnostics are required, so all those in whom this is necessary must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal agrees with the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (National Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and with the patients like Fabrizio, who made his test at a private laboratory, for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phase despite his young age and even the Kaposi Sarkom (a cancer-like tumour), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different when you know you've got AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, you'd rather place three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, drive sport and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, take a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and to the other person," Fabrizio recalls, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the global AIDS day.
They should make the test when they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live in a responsible way.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condom behind the shop table
There are large holes between health programs and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the matter of HIV.
And the most important is prevention.
"The distribution of condoms has actually been increased in the places that are concerned; they have been given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Youths are among the risks of new infections.
"Where do you need this?" is a widespread ridiculous question of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system that do not want to suspend young people, the correspondent assured.
He suggested that this inefficient distribution be reoriented; the condoms should not only be behind the store table, but in issuers in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
It is not to promote promiscuity.
It should not be paid to them the beer and motel, as governor Emilio González answered to the question of whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who already exercise a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key Data of Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is nationally located in the 4th place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and in the 13th place of HIV.
92% of the infectious cases occur via sex, 6% over blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
After the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which has been reached through a trade bank in Mexico, an unhealthy precedent is created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country with payment problems.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws do not have validity in the country of stars and stripes in conflict with international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas leads to the fact that the Mexican companies are not obsessed with the secrecy of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call the U.S. Supreme Court for three contradictions.
While the judge pointed out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit appeal court, based in New Orleans, first says that the main procedure is the trade bank in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation is not known in cases of incapacity for companies with cross-country profiles.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Act was created for the unification of international trade law, with the American Law Institute being used as a simpler one.
Second, the judgment stipulates that without the votes of the companies, after recognising the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass which Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are a half dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Instituteo Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut für Handelskonkurse).
It is also true that after the votes of the branches were withdrawn, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the Gier Founds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would be 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the Appeal Court.
On the other hand, Vitro is blamed for his difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country strike.
For this reason, the González Sada family contradicts the same appeal court so that the vote will take place in the plenary, i.e. from all judges, because only three voted.
If this is not done, the Cerciorare appeal which requests the verification of the proceedings by a higher instance shall be filed in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The difficulty in this case is that the Court gave a document that was sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Law on Trade Concurrence, and in which it is pointed out that it had been strictly held by the two countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Concurrence Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission for international trade, i.e. the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border incapacity which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the advertisements by the Mexican trade unions for air traffic against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, did not advance several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Coworking Association of Pilots) finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now submitted a criminal procedure against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is prevented from disability of justice.
Afterwards, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the general administration of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur to deduct from the trust account F/589 of the Bank IXE to the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million Pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart has changed
A group of national and foreign environmental protectors, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a broad front in order to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we speak of a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Processing Industry) has reached to unite the governors in the southeast to resist the monumental facility, which partially destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Ownership.
As you know, these measures have been taken, although the Senate had not considered the possibility, because he considered it infringed the free expression of opinion in the social networks.
Homex Long term
In pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the building company Homex brings over 500 million Pesos to the market.
The emissions are the first of four equal emissions that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competition
E-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies of information technology, formed from NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, a group of companies under the name Competival, whose goal is the service market of the software cluster in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are more than $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The World Bummeler of Basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sport for more than 60 years and traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have a so large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball like Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, author and director in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"For my life, I have set up a lot of guards in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, headquarters of the National Team and President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled at a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and witness them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a co-competitor or managing director of the club.
"That were my best years I enjoyed most because I was allowed to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as Managing Director, Co-Business Director or Trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships between 1971 and 1975.
And then I adopted with a mastership in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took place, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players ever had Puerto Rico.
Afterwards, Bartow recommended the free-cast specialist Raymond Gausse, who left a citizen and was one of our best advertising professionals.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another one.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted him, but already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he prefered to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won the pre-Olympian tournament in Mexico against the US.
Afterwards, the World Championship in 1990, where we held the fourth place, what should have been Bronze if not this Canadian arbitrator, who made us repeat the last move for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Championship the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympiad.
My favorite, however, is the team of the pan-American games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as at the time when they won us at the Bronze World Championship.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be involved in 1990 because of a knees violation.
A team that might not have been the best in terms of personalities, but we won a gold medal with which we had great joy, was that of the pre-Olympian tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the locked players because of the incidents on the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was without doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His figures at the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculin.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different bodies in which he played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The boy likes the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the National Team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
For example, that the boys in Ponce play only in their area and only meet in the national Playoffs teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children make unnecessary many travels and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officers and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R", in the TV series "Dallas", where he played a scrupulous, homeless and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birthtown Dallas, where he played again the iconic role that he loved most," said the family.
The Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the festival of the Memorial of the harvest.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and successive series, was with Hagman, when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He was pleased to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full trains," Gray explained in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 with liver cirrhosis, and he admitted that he had been drinking much over years.
In 1995, a malicious tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent a transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman was known as a nice guy on television in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Superb Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on the head when he meets an attractive "Dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also a performer of two comedies, which were only briefly emitted, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema's work included the criticism of well-evaluated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his mastery interpretation of the magnificent awesome J.R., who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain on the Ewing clan and other figures in their surroundings was emitted from April 1978 to May 1991.
The proposition "Who shot J.R.?", the expectation for an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were thrown in competition houses.
So the series reached a viewer record at that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who transformed "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin who had shot the daughter of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had weakened her and threatened to present her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. But others also had reasons to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, unsatisfactory man with a charismatic smile: a reluctant businessman and unfaithful husband who strived to introduce his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on the gravestone of J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-worker of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "decent personality on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and unforgettable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts for us who have the happiness of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, the broadcaster informed.
By Warner or TNT there was no immediate explanation about how Hagmann's loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a youth when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the New York Theaterbühne at the beginning of the 1950s and then served in the Air Forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he called his memories "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I haven't written anything I believed it could harm someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press of his time.
After the liver transplant, he worked for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are ahead and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but it's gonna go well."
Similarly, he took part in several campaigns against smoking.
Beginning of the course studying the "end of the world"
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germ, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Maya calendar's "long back" census on December 21, which many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurrikan Sandy, whom some called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which the Christian theoretists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever existed," said Charmé this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If anyone analyzed what happened today in the world, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who should offer this semester, which should be the last in history, courses about the "end of the world".
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Medien, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germ, and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread with time," he said, as well as how hypothetic scenarios are offered that lead to a specific human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could compare with real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World".
"We don't pick up in 2012 so that we always keep the option to resume the course, in case the world is not undergoing," said Restall.
Despite the "existing decline", students must study, create projects and participate in final audits.
In Penn State, the final examination will be carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, so the students have no other chance of "to continue to work until the night where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his course for high average students, who filled with 35 students.
For weeks before semester start, we received emails from students who asked if there were still places free.
The students, on their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious perception is actually only a question of comfort or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"Never have I heard anything about a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the respondent students - and less a professor - said to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
Mayas never foretold the end of the world; it is only one key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Where the people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who teaches this year in the Philippines, quickly answers the question whether he would know there a course about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote to an exception to a higher instance.
We have a favor from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that many days were spoken by the last court over the years, and said that when nothing happens on December 21, "the people immediately think of a new date" or philosophered that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period, which the end of the world came.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to go to celebration about "the end of the world".
"Perhaps I call a few friends so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
