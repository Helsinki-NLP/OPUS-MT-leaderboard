Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
U.S. President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check over 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the Norwegian metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he first meets with the five committee members who chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
Afterwards the presidential couple planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its highlight with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He receives these as the fourth US President, but only as the third who receives the price directly in office.
The White House already acknowledged that Obama will talk about Afghanistan war when taking the price.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking over the price as a President who is currently leading war in two countries.
He has strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending other troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgot to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the cheque over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to donate for well-being purposes, but he has not yet decided about a specific charitative work.
The event program then provides a banquet with the President and his wife, where, except for Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and other 250 guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant to the price from the beginning.
He said, for example, that he felt that he didn't deserve the price.
He also repeated several times that it is not only the price for him, but for all who seek the same values as he did.
Immediately after the announcement, he noted that this is "demand for action" for him.
Nature protector is accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz Police accused the Chairman of the Civil Association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for expression.
In several cases, he launched appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals, he demanded money from the investors to his favour, said the Leitmeritz Policespeaker, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaftist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and it threatens him a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste container in Brünn does not smell well
In Prague people can sort the beverage packs, in the southern Moroccan villages you will find again on step and get the sorting waste containers.
And in Brn?
There you would have to book a few minutes to find the suitable garbage tonnes.
I don't want to claim that the separation of waste in Brünn would not work at all.
But I think that the Councillors are inadequately concerned with this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brn is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because as a citizen here, we can always only dispose of paper, glass and plastics, but above all by the number of waste for such waste.
Did they try to dispose of the PET bottles in a collective basket at some point in the center?
This is just art, before all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found to be random until now is the footsteps opposite the hit gans.
Mr. Unterka is not supposed to be angry with his colleagues, but I do not think that is too little.
In addition to the fact that waste separation is not a honey sleeve in other parts.
For this reason, whole numbers of my friends do not prefer to sort the waste at all.
Out of lazyness.
They're too far to the garbage tonnes.
I'm not surprised.
I offered some glass and plastic bottles even after the celebration.
But on the Konicova street, I have not seen any color waste tones in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right place on the road.
But the garbage was almost over.
This is still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brenner socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city a ice hockeyliga that makes us shame throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few more garbage tonnes and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brown.
I am glad that I could also confirm my adoption with official statistics after I have been looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data provided by the EKO-KOM company, Brünn is really the worst in the whole district of South Morocco.
The "Paroubek" Budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the left party gave more money to farmers and officials, despite the government's view, there is no more money available in the budget for pensions, sick money and construction savings.
But neither for the national debt interest nor for the international court disputes.
This causes those more problems that will be at the government in the second half of the next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists have enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expect the government to pay the money for the sensitive expenses, pensions or sickness benefits. "This is just a breakdown of the problems in the future, mines," says Janota.
The loans pay more and more interest, and you have to reimburse the money some time.
Too much to select where to take, the state cash is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the State operation are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the firearm, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
In order to get the pensions or the sickness money, from which the account has disappeared 1,8 billion, people do not have to be afraid, they get this money.
But by the price that the State is even more indebted - the next year, not only 163 billion are missing in the State case, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and, together with them, the cost and interest.
The State will need the money to compensate, and it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce maternity money, as the government made in its regional efficiency package.
Due to the deflation of money in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing for the development of motorways and railways next year.
It is mainly the sections gained in competition, which can no longer be reprojected and possibly billed.
At most, what is not free of charge.
This means delay or stop of thirty large buildings, also threatened to Europe's money creation, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it dissolves the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ shareholders in which the State is the owner of Majority, and from which the money is then paid out into the transport fund.
The problem is that the height of the dividend is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
The previous year, 18 billion from CEZ fled into the budget.
Every year the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled up and this money is also a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to the Nieveau of 5.7 percent GDP according to the EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the conversions yet.
Almost three billion cut the budget for various compensations for victims of Communism and criminal offences or for expenses for court disputes, even for construction savings.
Whether the State gets right without that money is not sure.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister will have to save the money in front of us or attack the government budget reserve in the worst case.
One hundred million are also missing for the already started two billion "state case" project that will allow on line to monitor for what the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single key.
The plans presented are promising.
It's enough to press only one key, and from Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company wants to imagine VMware, which focuses on the development of the virtual software for the computer.
We enable you to perform two user profiles simultaneously on the phone.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, pointed out Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented a few days ago for the first time.
The market will be held in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalist.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory on which simultaneously the mentioned systems ran Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full.
Now VMware is working together with European and American operators in the smartphone virusization, and the customer is supposed to come to the devices within 2012.
Snow deficiencies on the mountains harass the hotel owners
Scnealess slopes don't just worry about the giant mountains.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That's why you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and Silvester in Giant Mountains.
Our pages are often visited.
People are passing through the offers, fixing the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether we believe this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, quoted.
If you want the Silvester stay in the spindle mill exactly according to your ideas, you should no longer hesitate with the order.
Who prefers saving and where the quality of stay comes at the second place, he can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the Silvester Day.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they will have to give up, and go in for shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura appreciated.
Free beds at all winter dates always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi Travel Office can also offer the Silvester Day in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
The first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes have been sneaked within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Reversely and slightly better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizon in Pecpod Snezkou are able to place.
We are about five percent better than the previous year.
On the New Year's Day and Christmas we have only a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The hotel Omnia is also occupied at the Central Park in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, half of the beds remain free.
This year of January we were surprised, for which we are already over 60 percent occupated at the time.
A little weaker is now February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains is certainly also increasing, led by the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The giant mountain hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow decay.
On Thursday it should cool down, and if it comes to rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But thereafter, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Recurrence is Mother of Cleverness
It is almost funny with what pupils' commitment Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the clause, repeated the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself believed as the damnest.
Finally, when he enthusiasticly expected Afghanistan doctor, it was shown that he was writing it over the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only that in the text he uses the wording "as in Iraq" several times, he even used the name of the Bush declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward path", without sauding.
Three years ago, he criticized the Bush idea - fresh troop quotas in Iraq plagued by the Civil War - as "unresponsible and in their consequences karastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on military recommendations was the only possible and very successful in such a way that today, in the news about Iraq, one is no longer speaking at all.
The call Bushs was not improved, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle is repeated.
To increase the contingent of the troops, he again asked the military, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite subordinating habits, severely criticized the shaking protectors in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation to better.
The President hesitated three months, but did not come to a better idea, so he deceived the General by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even though he originally expected at least 10,000.
Highly problematic to the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years.The entire Obama doctor leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the semi-development will bring the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Even despite the brother war in recent years, the Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can rely on and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces who are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally properly founded, will remain only shining buildings behind which will further increase patriarchal tribal relations.
The balance of interest between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the uncertainty of the situations which further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "handling state" which is the minimalistic goal of the whole operation.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened, and now it is on the explosion edge.
This believes that the small soldiers who have broke out in the war cry about the "Return of Frühheim" can create a miracle here can only be a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the deduction of troops is purely unresponsibly, because the Taliban will accept it as the indirect consent of the U.S. defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is prone.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain to their electors how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukus region.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the stronger sanctions do not affect Iranians, it is a very difficult question for the United States whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period when America goes to Obama for the victory withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic turning of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation plant for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election, so it remains enough time for him to take a different strategy, that would prove to be a total failure.
The managers of Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premiumboni in bar
The leading executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premiumboni in cash this year.
This has announced the company that responded to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, but it is only possible to sell in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, is thus at the top of the efforts to connect the premieboni of Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the continuing direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, said.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs was the target of criticism after she had put almost 17 billion dollars on top for the first three quarters of this year for premiumboni.
The total amount of the premium bonuses during this year, after the Reuter Agency, will probably also exceed $20 billion, despite the measure displayed today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hotest political issue at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, the UK reported that it intends to charge the bonuses of bankers that exceed 25,000 pounds once with a 50 percent tax.
Similar steps also prepare France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all departments, except in physics.
Five recordwives today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf took this year's nobel prices in the categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian assembly, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countryman Jack Szostak for chromoson research.
The price for chemistry has been received by the Israelin Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the information of the ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin gave the Nobel Prize for Economy, which American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a nobel prize this year was physics.
Today, the scientists Charles Kao, together with Willard Boyl, took this prize for the research in the glass fiber area and George Smith for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical remote pipes.
Each of these awards has received the diploma, nobel medals and certificate of the acquisition of the money price.
This is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the money price is divided among them.
According to tradition, the American President, Barak Obama, received the most expected noble peace price in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he recognized the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path and is also at the top of the country that leads two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in respect of his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the fighting of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who thinks about his stay in the government on Friday, because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form of the release by the MEP on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remain of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit of etat is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday.
According to the budgetary law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the left-party proposals for money conversion and increased the money for public officials, for the maintenance of social services and direct wages for farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democrats that it covers the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute has arisen, because the question mark on the further work of the fishing official cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in spring.
Criticians claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of savings measures carried out by the fishermen's government in autumn, which, according to their understanding, is intended to end state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the State budget but does not have to, said today at the beginning of the discussion with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "ernstige problem", which represents "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He believes there is no longer a good solution today.
Improvement could only lead to a strong government which could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS Chairman, Mirek Topolanek, said that the budget is gray, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said to the CTK that the concept of the official cabin with support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is apparently no longer working.
Premier Fischer described similar words as "strong expressions" in the editorial action.
The CSSD Chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the Etat Deficit was gray, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the State budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unslaped" of the world shows much of the country, whose struggle and victory despite some criticisms, that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The intimate fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story of the American Oscar shoe player, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the nineteen-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Another significant role takes Matt Damon.
I said to him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the box area "Million Dollar Baby" already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which the end became a slave holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely someone who still lives and is as important for many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for his active activity in terminating apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set freely in 1990, and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak.
The film describes a true event where Nelson Mandela joined his powers with the captain of the South African Rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to agree the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racial and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through sports, so he decides to agree the rubbian players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises up to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said, if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, to eat with him in the evening and to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela his hand.
I've found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, she's being transferred, and I felt that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to be another person.
Matt Damon is the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I sounded to the door ring that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the film I look much bigger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the statue of the actors compared to their actual models, under the leadership of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" he has received positive reviews and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good history, very well performed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Dissolved light secrets about Norway: The Russians have tested a rocket
A particular light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only admitted yesterday that a intercontinental ballistic rocket was tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again, and the type "Bulava" called rocket, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the premiere, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the Rakete test also had no positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava has usually not started at all or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already written as a "Rakete that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This already thirteenth attempt, was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight there were technical damage to the rocket.
The engine probably exploded at the third rocket level.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atom U boat Dmitry Donskij, which went under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the shot from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern paths was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
On the other hand, the generality has been observed this time and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rockets did not fall out and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was done without error, the management of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore complies with the generality with optimism and is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersound atmospheric heads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual agreement with the CSKA Moscow at 51 years
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov represents itself again at 51 years in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympiager and Stanley Cup captain are helping his team CSKA Moscow in the need, and probably already attacks KHL in Friday's Doll against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career with 40 years, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another gun player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some other formalities, the Agency quoted the Coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
Meanwhile it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morality of other fellow players.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice area, he becomes after AP the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game.
In the NHL, the legendary stürmer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with fifty years and was able to benefit 15 matches and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic Gold Medaillen, seven World Championship titles, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gathered successes in the NHL, where he took the Stanley Cup twice over his head in the Detroit-Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the ice hockey star room.
Hyundai gave up to the trade unions. All overtimes are lifted up
The management of the Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union to abolish all overtime.
Due to often ordered overtime, the trade union announced the willingness of streaks on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speaker of the Hyundai automotive factory, Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants to agree with the trade unions about a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working layers would be worked, said Vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work on Saturday.
The staff will also receive the Saturday shift on November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the surplus or they can take substitute leave on December 28th and thus extend Christmas celebration, Vanek performed.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday layer are paid the riding money and lunch.
With regard to the fact that the overtimes were the most urgent and burning point in the demands and complaints of the trade unions that had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtimes for the month of December, Vaněk launched.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive factory were forced to work almost every day after eight hours.
With the signing of the agreement, the willingness of strikes will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions are expected to be reached on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a joint document, they are willing to revoke the willingness of streaking.
The location in the automotive factory was spited last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously stretched for continuous overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged Schicans.
On the other hand, the management held that employees must make the overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The trade unions also demanded that no penalties be imposed on the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year, they are calling for the payment of 5000 crowns.
The Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was launched in November last year in the company.
Until this September, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in 'gestowed' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists testes new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to medicines.
This fact predominates against the disadvantage that the connection to normal virus variants does not work as much as one of the existing medicines.
The disease of AIDS cannot be healed yet.
Patients can, however, extend their life and prevent the increase in HIV viruses in the body.
However, your administration is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus reproduction has also resulted in the development of resistant viruses, which are no longer effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological Hochschule) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalokarborans act on the protein that is responsible for increasing the HIV virus.
The metaphorborans are compounds of Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus reproduction in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new 'improved' compounds that were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus eiweiß substance.
The metalokarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two versatile cages consisting of boar, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Heavenly and persistent virus
HIV protease is protease of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there would be no mature infection virus particles.
When we turn off HIV protease, we also turn off the increase of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Scientific Magazine Journal of Medicine Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further changed.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances tested against HIV protease words in the reagent glass, also against their persistent (resistent) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalokarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicines used are often unsafe.
The unique effect mechanism, as well as its further characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of other chemical designs, makes the metalokarborans interesting links for further research aimed at developing effective medicinal products against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, director of the Laboratory for Structure Biology of Institutes for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fighting about budget. ODS went on to fishermen who refused
The Chairman of ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "grey" and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "star expressions".
It's supposed to be time for analysis.
The Deputy ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is apparently no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament, if it is the fight against the increasing deficit, or whether he is left in the office by means of the links of Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problems of public deficits differs diametrally, and Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the budget for the year 2010 on Wednesday, but with link party amendments more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for public officials, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has noted the social democrats' proposals that it covers the budgetary deficit.
Czech Republic should manage with a residue of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has come to the request of the government, because the altered budget is only a less bad variant of the budgetary project.
Discouragement and Sensualness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, talked about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government still assesses the present situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his withdrawal to the case that the amendments would be adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered for Monday after the government business at the Prime Minister.
He indicated that he was considering his further stay in the office.
The reason for this is his disappointment about the dismantling of the budget.
As far as fishermen are concerned for the further fight with the budget deficit, according to Necas, nominants of the Social Democrats (CSSD) who had made the changes in the budget have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt more deficit law, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or the service law novel.
Topolanek: The Ministers nominated by ODS did not irritate
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, in deputy function, people who confess themselves to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decide to stop fighting against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-hand majority currently in Parliament".
Then he is supposed to be unable to expect the support and tolerance of the citizens' Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and if this is going to be present, I'm going to deal with it, the Minister of Defense, Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens of the Democrats, told the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council meeting in the afternoon.
The ODS returned on the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote in favour of the amended budget on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister would explicitly ask the members of the Citizen Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not appear as orphanage children, we are not small children, then he responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice would be missing.
Even when I abandoned the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, above all, it would be positive about the Bolschewization of Parliament and destruction, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new map of the CD (Czech Railway), less trains will drive for about the same price.
The Czech railway will end or limit some less-lasted fast and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The whole area of transport is reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new schedule compared to today.
Most of the prices incl. base and customer tickets are not changed.
Several connections to the capital, for example, receive the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway sets trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The quick train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also be driven on the Prag - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letoorad are reduced.
The largest reduction plans the railway in Hradec Kralove District (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, on the other hand, can look forward to an increase in Prague and the surroundings.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and to a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to turn around in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth roadway of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distances to the capital will end at the main train station Prague.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino connection lines between Prague and Ostrava, and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will travel in the time range of two hours.
With the Pendolino, the passengers have been unable to drive to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional railroad: increase by 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, as a whole the railway receives to balance the so-called liquidity loss in the next year four billion crowns, just as this year. Local trains provide the districts, as a total they pay eight billion crowns next year, with the State shooting three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the fast trains, the railway has newly concluded a 10-year contract until now the contract has always been completed for only one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it has not taken the price increase at the large majority of the tickets.
Changes are only available for one-day network tickets CD Net and for cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the driven slope until now he was united for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitantes take over 50 people, the children were released.
Millitantes kidnapped 75 people today in the south of the Philippines, including some basic students and their teachers.
This has led to the AFP Agency, which originally informed only over 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children held were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
In the Province of Agusan del Sur, there was a kidnapping.
About 19 million people were supposed to use the hostages as a living sign when they escaped the police.
The local negotiators are now striving for the release of the rest of the hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the millions belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the law was imposed on the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which was associated with the election in the Governor's Office, were 30 journalists.
Due to the suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the imfluential ampatuan clan, was arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But those who resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippinian government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinema "Invictus: the unslaughter" which includes a part of the history of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, who was supposedly elected by Mandela himself augee a few years ago.
The adjoining role of the legendary South African Champions in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
The cinema start of the film also makes reactions by critics and the public loud.
Nelson Mandela
He is named Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sacchar Prize, then in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinemas in a time when, on the one hand, in South Africa the preparations for the World Championship are collapsed, but at the same time the media shaken world publicity with fearful news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruled majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are very positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
According to the new film, Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words.
I dreamed of this role for many years and prepared well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that, as you say, I can receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can get this movie to the personality of Mandelas and his message.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every human being, he supplemented.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book template of British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, the South African defender of human rights portrays within his first presidential election period.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two race groups and each year, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the world cupfield in his role in the South African National Ridge, which then won South Africa.
For the entry into the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped large ovations fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may perform it again to join the people into a single people, the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, that will only show itself.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, such as in recent interview for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Great Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In Louny, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching system at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
In the fire, according to the speaker of the Usti nad Labem District Fire, Luke Marvan, took six units.
Originally the fire gun wanted to burn the transformers out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is deleted with a mixture of water - foam and special extinctions.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer interior closure.
No one was injured that the Havarie did not endanger the security operation of the management system according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated to be several 10 million crowns, more precisely, the damage will be paid only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, there has been nothing similar in the company of Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, complemented.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesperson of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the trafostation did not affect the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is active in the Czech area as a single operator of the management system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switches with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises criminal indication for slander against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal insults against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moria, Radko Martinek from Pardubice District and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute inteview in the Radiojournal.
The action depends on the efforts of the company to operate regional tractors in some regions.
All regions, however, finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the rosins, we only submitted the offer to the extent that it had been agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that were completed last week.
So nothing is left to us but to defend us.
As a result of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the survey of the criminal indication to continue the medial show of Jancura, which serves him as a free advertising for his company as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also ask for further leaders to do so.
I suppose that even in this matter it will be clear that it is Jancura, who manipulates the public in the matter of regional road transport and uses lying and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he invested several million crowns in advertising that will point to the detrimental step.
He told the radiojournal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and he wanted to continue after New Year.
He stated that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign initiated Jancura, after the districts agreed with the Czech railways to operate regional railways and had not issued tenders for the contract in a high about 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, he was threatened by a member of the CSSD because of the criticism of train transport in the districts.
The only threat was if we do not avoid losing the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said Jancura to the Radiojournal today.
vaccination against pneumococs free and voluntary
Invasion against pneumococs changes the habit with effect from January.
It is supposed to be the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But votes are already reporting that the mandatory implementation would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumocococks.
The pharmaceutical institution already defines the maximum prices of the vaccines to pay health insurance.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
vaccines free of charge for August children
As of January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococs born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition st that they have not yet received a dose of vaccination.
Those who have already started vaccination last year or earlier must also pay further recovery vaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Previous year, a quarter of the families had impfed their children against pneumococs.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In general, experts estimate that health insurance spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year for the vaccine doses.
But they save in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the State has spent about 500.000 per year for all the children's territorial ineptions.
The mandatory implication was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococs cause mediocre inflammation, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammations and blood poisoning.
We die from pneumococic infections in hospitals a year after examining up to 28 children aged up to 10 years of age.
Outside the Czech Republic, the duty of children to combat pneumocokken was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid by insurance and voluntary.
That the obligation would be better, for example, mentioned the head of the civilian association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
Its association has already been for the Pneumococ Impact in the long term.
The experts at the international conference at which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have succeeded in implementing at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococs.
At this moment, we don't consider that at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The Chairman of the Faculty of Practical Children's Doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, you could think about reducing the number of repetitions: "In a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination has been launched as a voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of the parents to impf their infants against pneumocokken from next year onwards.
The vaccination against pneumococs is also a breakthrough that it is paid as the first territorial reduction by health insurance and not by the State.
Insurances should spend the money for prevention to save them for further treatment, cracked Cabrnochova.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this involves anxiety of the practical children's doctors on the purchasing of the vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that insurances could "execute money from health insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance pays them.
According to the estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns each month, which is a significant sum.
That won't be easy at all, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son involved in "Museum Diebstahl"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars from the museum of his father.
According to Pennsylvania's police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken into his car with trailers when he invited 90 paintings.
It means that Frank Frazetta Junior and another man would have used a bagger to invade the museum into the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his representation of shapes such as Conan of the Barbar and Tarzan.
Associated Press reported that the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family party.
The Agency reported that, according to a police courtesy statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father, "that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all paintings into a camp".
The Agency informed that Frank Frazetta Senior contends to have granted any permission.
Labour defends Etat and Tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of opposition, economy and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have "suffered" an opportunity to show that he seriously meant the reduction of the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The Treasury Chancellor was also in charge of targeting workers with low and medium-sized income.
Its main proposals include an increase of 0.5% in social security and a 1% limit on public wage accounts for 2011.
Social security workers
The trade unions, on the other hand, protested that low wages recipients are punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned against upcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to about 3 billion UK pounds per year - has annoyed the private economy, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic upturn.
The increase, limited to those earning more than 20,000 pounds per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
SHIPPUNCTION OF THE PREAB-ETAT REPORT
Increasing social security by 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50 % tax on banking bonuses
1 % increase in corporation tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax disadvantages for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increasing State pensions by 2.5 %
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by €90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorer by £ 190, while a person with £ 10,000 will be richer at £ 110.
The Ministers said that their objective of deficit reduction by 2013 meant "stricky decisions", but they also said that 60% of the charges of additional taxes would be paid to the 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argues that the estimated tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"That are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit half and this is also necessary over the next four years," he informed the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's forecasts on future economic growth – which influences the extent of re-indebtedness and the speed of deficiency – were questioned after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy will probably shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the decline by 3.5%, which was predicted in April - while the debt would be higher by £3 billion than previously estimated.
"Please Occasion"
The Conservatives who want to start a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn the "school memorial crisis" of Labour said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is incontinuable.
They added that the Ministers have failed to present a credible plan, how they will pay back this and press "cynical" before difficult decisions until after the election, which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"You haven't said anything of significance about what they're going to do," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them go."
"The important announcements are made only after the choice whoever wins it."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour continues to keep schools, hospitals and the police from future reductions, unlike the proposals of the conservatives, which see the deficit capability coming faster and more.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money obtained by the tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argued that the plans were "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions in April, some would suspend the treasure Chancellor's accusation of voting, as the money could just be recovered in the next year.
Labour continues to provide extra assistance when people need it the most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Hold Etat"
Although the Ministers have not announced any Etat details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognised Institute of Tax Examination said that the figures of the Treasury Chancellor would mean strong deductions in many areas, perhaps in the future in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defense.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins it," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to the business auditing company Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow pre-ab eating report. The markets recognize this."
FBI examines "Festions of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI examines the arrest of five US citizens reported because of the suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested at an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab province, told the American message in Pakistan to the BBC.
The FBI said that it is investigated whether these are the same men, the last month in the U.S. state of Virginia was reported as missing.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistanian origin, one is Egyptian origin, and the other has a Jemenite background.
"When they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the accusations that are accused of them and under what circumstances they are held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said that the authority was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistan authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are the most missing students," she said.
The Pakistani message in Washington told that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house and that no charges were filed against the arrested men yet.
The Reuters News Agency reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US must "continue working together with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported as missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "Missbreads" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, it is still as bad about human rights in Iran as in the past 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of his human rights balance.
Official bodies said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedschad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and killed dozens, leading to the largest road protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Thousands of people received prison sentences and accusers said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, now located in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak stream event.
But since then there has been no more tolerance to criticism from the authorities, said our correspondent.
"False Consent"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting against the election results.
"They often struck me into the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in the neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they reduced me."
After five days, he signed a false consent and was, still bleeding and half consciously, released on the street, told Amnesty.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the prerogatives of rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner who said that with 75 others he had been held in a container in a prison in Kahrizak with more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the courts had established a committee which should examine the turmoil after the election and the reactions of the government, but so Amnesty, the mandates and powers of these institutions would not be clear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 persons were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform a true sign in Bristol into a competition piste.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders fighting for money prices.
On the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short tail at the beginning of a 100 meters long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the summit of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city shining below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were granted for the best pieces of art performed on the slope or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss elector voted for a ban on minarette and the concerns for the alleged islamisation of Europe widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a founded and well-considered report about whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most explained so-called secularized societies of Europe — and be integrated.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French don't love heads" (Why the French Don't Like Headscarves) (2006), an elegant and densely argumenting study of a dispute question that shared and employed the country for over another and a half decade, and whose effects are still to be perceived today.
Bowen's latest book offers a wider and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most disturbing.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town house (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it possible for a Muslim to use a sense-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
They are these seemingly profane matters, he claims that they represent daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that the media are engaged.
The author recognizes a new generation of imamens, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly except Tarik Ramadan, a Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have all arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists questioned Bowen are mostly unequivocal with their Salafi matches – defenders of purist sunnitic Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – showing a small but influential presence among European Muslims today.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He challenges the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a more rude treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "destructiveness of value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most controversial view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice they characterize melts with alarming speed and takes life with itself that can nowhere else survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their throat water.
Richard Ellis, a author and illustrator, writes in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural story of the icon of the north, the ice bear.
In the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting on the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson encountered with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old fehanrich to the lake, which only fought with the gun coat of his muskets, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears, who were caught when they swammed behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, were brought into zoos and circuss.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears in an imagination.
Even today, zoo plants still typically have a millionth of the life range of a wild-life old animal. The climate is rarely suited: the ice bear in Singapore was completely green by the algae that grows in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for survival of the species.
Although forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, the establishment in Greenland and Canada continues where hunters in helicopters and motor slide-driven Inuit use powerful storm guns to ride their probe.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the ice" (original title "After the ice") Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and alarming description of the science of the Arctic and a packing insight on how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can properly explain the speed of changes.
But this is not due to a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century were the first time to announce the confusion of the package.
In the cold war, underseas boats measured the moving grace when undergoing.
A useful supplement are satellite measurements and the large-scale display of measuring soles on icebergs, but many are still achieved by unfrightened people camping outside the cold.
Anderson throws a glimpse into the strange, tiny world of the flow system within the Arctic ice formed by salt water ring halls that are pressed together during freezing.
But, starting from beer on ice to the microscopic little miracles in ice, all are threatened when the summer ice goes away, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... could we be"
Marine infanterists were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington cranes
The upper freed De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put a single crane on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine infanterists, who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Friedhof in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington-Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the throat producer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves on the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill, and his wife Karen, who each year undertakes this journey, continues along the way in various cities to conduct events dedicated to people in military and victims of terrorism.
The Worceters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (cranes throughout America), which also extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 cranes on the graves on the Arlington courtyard, in areas on the Pentagon, on graves of the Fayetteville National Court in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the Memorial for United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than 150,000 dollars for buying and transporting the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the journey to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband has not been buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is their way to give back to those who brought sacrifices.
She said that's a little contribution to how we can support civilians our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers crossed the vast grass areas and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as a target, since they are not visited as often as the younger tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was joyful, children played, and couples kept on their hand while carrying the fresh pine branches to the grey tombstones.
Each round crown was dark green with a small red loop that was attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends kept on each other in the ice air.
Some read out the names fought in stone, while others bowed down to small black-white space cards that had been placed in the moist mud, whose grave stones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forgot bitter tears before the tomb of her son.
She traveled 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infrastructure sub-officier David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been anymore for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the US Government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. with its headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, U.S.A. for international development and for the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US representative of interest in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5th.
The special claims have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything under the accusation of the "risk".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government enemy graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the Castro Bruder in Cuba and the Obama government, which sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy values that the United States will achieve a compensation when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed normal citizens this year to buy a mobile phone, they are used to send text messages since a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily pay.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Too many websites are limited to access.
On Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens, who are in prison in Cuba, are behind grids for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the U.S. representative in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and imprisonment are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently produced a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", a presentation on the establishment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused would be arrested, sentenced and arrested very often within one day.
He said that probably every solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistanian government representatives cover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy on Saturday, aiming to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist candidates who are looking for radical young men.
Investigators said that they had sought an opaque rebellionist, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had made comments on terror attacks consent on the Internet video page YouTube.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to the immigration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unreal mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covered operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged in any way and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to access the Al-Kaida warrants when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal executive authorities.
The case of the five men - which are still in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the candidates in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important, in the decision who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. secret service has made it a matter of urgency to accommodate human activity posts within Al Kaida.
The candidates of the organization act as pourts who do not let those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American wildlife recruits are subjected by A Kaida to a special examination, said analytics.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also regarded as extremely attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, ranked analysts of the NEFA founding based in the US, said that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years in view of whom they have allowed access, because the US secret services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
If you try to put someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded the subcontractors in the Bella Congress Centre of the City of Climate Protection.
Demonstrants said that 100.000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates were rather about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists blew small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
One day, when little happened in the UN climate negotiations, thousands of activists wandered through the city with translucents, on which in English "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, photographer Helena Christianssen, who said that traveling to Peru, the country of her mother’s birth, would make her aware of the heartfelt problems that the country has to struggle because of the already perceiveable effects of climate change.
This is part of the motives why I decided to participate in the great demonstration - in order to forward the word and appeal to the world leaders to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no longer a way that leads around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are banned in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be called because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing fired several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, where there are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they began as a light missile, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the congress center, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest seems to have not achieved the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate dealer.
When asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he answered in English: "This is something I wasn't even aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the place of the event is large, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of individuals whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and various sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Examination data show persistent racial gap
The certificates of mathematics performance were welcomed good news for public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the schools of the country, which produces maximum performances, the testimonies show that in the past two years the fourth and eighth clauses have made faster progress than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
What, however, is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the hardnight performance gap between Afro-American and white students, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average number of White Fourth Clauses from Washington D. C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
In fact, the progress of the Afro-American eightcells remained the same as it fell at a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white pupils was not included in the test data as the sampling number was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated White and Black Fourth Clauses in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that children have reached both groups has grown during this period, the difference with now 58 points has barely decreased.
A number of supporters of the district expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were mostly driven by white students who are already powerful children.
This suggests that we have raised the overall evaluation by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Executive Board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that enters for education equality in Washington D.C.
I don't jump up and down for a break of two or three points, said the Washington Democratic City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton basic school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of testing points is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect it.
But I'm afraid that we don't have to spend the time and energy we have to use for our high school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weakened students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading plan, the Wilson reading system, which aims at pupils in the upper classes of primary and secondary schools, which basic skills of reading have not mastered at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their equally mature classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, which focuses on playing from kindergarten to sixth class and life-serious experiences, was brought to Washington under the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progresses reported last week.
I think that we must continue to work to make the best measures to benefit students below the level of notes, said Rhee.
Others say that NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide the additional money and resources for the poor schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who investigates urban examination results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools that are located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could lead to political implications that work against this important agenda item.
The weakness is of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that she tries to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts of the city so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year currently 180 days in Washington to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who with his teacher work last year came to an agreement over 185 days a year, which he considered "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rising out and shining a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades and the smaragd green grass.
Gracielas parents have hardly completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was buried in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other eighteen clauses of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where teaching costs $38.690 per year, was rather the one of a fearful visitor than the one of an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtful when she was reported the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully accepted the intended message: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the U.S. hispanese immigrants who do not end the high school or who become pregnant as a teenager, on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college training that is necessary to climb into the middle layer.
In fact, one of the five of this "second generation" of Hispano Americans concludes the college – which is a remarkable performance, since many of their immigrationed parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the USA without having completed the high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workers.
Those who examine powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for the school and a indigenous drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of confidentiality with American schools.
But consulting programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If one looks at income weak children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them search through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network for these children from preschool to high school.
The Bundesprogramm, which had financed Gracielas College Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - switching up a corridor - and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when income weak students are in high school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom went to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 Treaties concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in renovating the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that has issued an order has pulled the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The thinly seated representatives of American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its gates after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and Europeans present the way, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still underlined by massively coordinated bombardments on Tuesday and political instability by the deduction of the U.S. military, probably prevented American oil companies from engaging more in Iraq, which has the third largest proven raw oil reserves in the world.
U.S. companies were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially Chinese and other State-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and who have been assisted with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors at two of the contracts allocated this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the Great of the World Economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure with its partners and fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
In order to pay the pre-committee companies, they gave bids, which were then compared with the charge per barrel oil, which the Ministry was ready to pay to increase the emission of each field beyond the current level.
Top Planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In a obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, this week a top action planer of Al Kaida was supposed to have been killed, reports US terrorist fighters on Friday.
This would be the second deadly attack on a high person responsible for the terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistanian authorities, were supposed to have been killed by a number of missiles who met their car on Tuesday near Miran Shah City in the province of North Wazilistan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said an official representative of a Pakistanian civilian secret service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Local residents who are suspected of being part of the military, ran to the place and quickly took up everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. terrorism fighting led indefinite evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, who led terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies all over the world, noticed a leading official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate character of American air attacks on Pakistanian soil.
It also included the planning of attacks against the US and Europe when taking its central role as given.
He accepted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and implemented them in operation plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somali had quickly risen in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and had best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this certainly does not reduce the danger he posed for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader, who had been killed since September, as was killed in a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the tribal area and three other topactivists.
The pace of attacks by drones of the CIA has declined from an average of six operations per month to two since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their attackability and, at the same time, killing intelligents who are suspected brutally, reported the page.
Heading UN senders in Kabul will resign
On Friday, the UN leader of the UN in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would withdraw from his office in March, thus terminating a stormy term of office that was trespassed by claims of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eides depart, when the Obama government has decided to send further 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN sender said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concerns that the U.S. timetable for the military withdrawal, which should begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilians to help in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The raising of troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said that he did not lay down his office, but only fulfill a agreement made to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO-
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon now forward so that he has time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he better starts looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started searching for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has taken into consideration the Swedish-Italian-Stimm Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Bagdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously led UN peace operations.
Eides' position in Afghanistan was tested after his former alternate, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to hide evidence of massive conviction.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - which was fired - have undoubtedly caused damage to the mission, because a great amount of skepticism already existed in relation to international interference in the election.
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative in order to coordinate the aid measures of the American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to set up more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate for the Afghan mission and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the UN polluting arrangements have undermined its ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are so designed that since May, he said, I could only set up one person.
This is catastrophic and mustn't continue so.
US Defense Minister Gates: Iran has to expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in discussions about his nuclear plans.
During a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in Northern Iraq and declined the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said as an answer to the question of a soldier about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which is indispensable to the war."
The Obama government considers a sanction package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the averageiran.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer immensely" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion of the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined European top politicians in the warning that Iran has to expect "believable" consequences if it does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
In conversations in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he would resume the discussions to limit his nuclear programme and abolish a substantial part of his stock of enriched uranium in exchange for nuclear fuel needed for his medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed this way of agreement in order to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since that date -- partly experts say, because the Iranian leadership is unanimously obliged to commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran left the international community with regard to some proposals which they had already agreed at the beginning of October has, openly said, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way as they were never in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31rd dec as a time limit for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will continue to follow other options, including those referred to by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once as "repressive sanctions".
In a opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian representation of the United Nations condemned what they called "basic and unfounded claims" on Thursday of some Security Council members on Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue the discussions with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he fled to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq with the soldiers in Kirk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and the division of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential of conflict in order to prevent delays in the US plans from reducing the U.S. force of troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to scatter the Kurdish concern about the upcoming troop deduction. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, President of the Kurdish regional government to Masud Barzani, said: "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave you."
A change in the course in the older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that held them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to talk more children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than one child by the low birth rate and the older population in this summer, their answer was immediately and final: "No case".
We've already invested all our time and energy into a child.
For a second child there's nothing left, said Wang, 31, a personnel manager with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notorically thick, deported individual children, who are lovingly called "small emperor", raises a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time that this policy entered into force, the UN
Departure of population issues, while the number of populations of 60 years and older in 2020 is expected to rise from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent explosion-like by 2050, which is far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and elderly people made almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Comission, said that couples in a productive age need to receive babies to "help reduce the ratio of the older population and reduce the shortage of labour in the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive relaxation
In the constitution of the country in 1978, China's single-child policy is likely to be the most controversial available that has been introduced from the governing Communist Party until today.
Couples who violate this policy have to expect enormous money penalties - up to their three-fold annual salary in some regions - and with discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese representatives have attributed this policy to avoiding the critical claims of the natural national resources, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural regions, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to dismiss.
Many couples had also had sexually self-employed abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards the single-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule – including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husbands and wife were single children – and in 2007 the sound of many hard slogans was smiled.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing couples two children who are a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July, which started an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters who taught families to have only one child were almost overnight replaced by directives that describe in detail who comes to question for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not very encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disturbing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outer areas of Shanghai said that a rise in the requests of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, only four to five requests remain per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want to have children.
They want to give the best to her first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was legally allowed.
But, as many Chinese people, they have only a small health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be indispensable.
People in the West devaluate the one-child policy as a human rights question, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, you rob us of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their disgusting.
Wang, the personnel director, said she wanted only a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to care for us.
We are not used to care for others and do not really want this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unblemished.
For parents from the middle level with double careers, by which the birth rate drops, he said, it turns to be successful and for that one must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, sets huge requirements for the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you have to have a career for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to do this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of life, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UN Group drafts emission reduction plan
The Climate Conference, supported by the UN – which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations – has re-established on Friday with the publication of a document, which has recorded an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations in the near future having to school the greatest burdens.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the control of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But he was regarded as important progress in a negotiation that is due to time, since next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a special UN working group, is swaying over the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature rise that political decision-makers would contribute.
The process will give a great flexibility, says John Coequyt, leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, called "the great whole".
It shows the basic principle of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent during the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday an excitement through its assurance to provide 3,6 billion dollars a year to help poorer countries adapt the effects of climate change, from the masters of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
Still, Friday brought the same verbal fireworks, which the discussions had decided in the last week.
The American Climate Specialist Todd Stern has refused formulations which require mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China, as representative of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the rise of larger emerging countries and taking measures, so star, who also complained that the text does not go far enough, will ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern delivered his opinion one hour after the Chinese Vice-President He Yafei's statement that the leading American climate dealer would either lack "the reason" or it was "highly unresponsible" by him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to overcome global warming.
In the face of the future economic march of the major world powers, both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging countries have been breaking lines.
The current struggle is equally related to the rescue of individual economies as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States against their obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozens of influential countries would ignore the scientific necessity to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of braking the greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have taken more aggressive action to take account of the countries with very high greenhouse gas taxes for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic domination, according to Ulate, who is also active as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries who are most exposed to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that discussions will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft contract on early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "exert political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand measures from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The discussions received a new urgency when the delegates concentrated on the fact that most open questions need to be clarified before the government leaders arrive in order to reach agreement.
High-range representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice Minister, escaped their planes and rushed through the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to seal claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The mere extent of the assembly -- 13.000 people go in and out daily at the congress centre, guitar-playing activists organise nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries they think betrayed and sell themselves, and contract designs are hand-by-hand instead of by e-mail -- are already a challenge.
The intensity just builds on: almost all major ministers are now here and from Wednesday onwards 60 government leaders in Copenhagen will be.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the Global Policy of the Organisation Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h faster train defines the mounting feeling new
Monday morning at 5 a.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a tour that represents a revolution in the traffic in Great Britain.
The first high-speed pendulum train in the country will be reached 225 km/h at its lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and deposit 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will go on board the first Javelin Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new United Kingdom service will finally connect to an international rail network of faster, reliable trains and will connect the large balling areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living pendulum cities, working hours would radically be reduced and the change of plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and roads.
In the theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds that are needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the unavoidable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still move the brake in the British high-speed glasses.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, will, according to the Times, submit the report on 30 December.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned level of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will pass with a space of five metres to urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, northward leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to it in spring.
The preferred option is a y-shaped route guide that would lead a single high-speed route to the West Midlands.
The route would share in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel period between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first subway, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with today a little over an hour.
Developing the trains would have the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 metres of trains with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation on the London-Birmingham route per hour.
This would, in turn, mean that in London a final station would be needed where 20,000 travellers could be finished per hour.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be pursued or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to change from high-speed trains to existing rail tracks in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be the travel period between London and Scotland at more than three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive knocking point so that a change from plane to rail can be ensured, a guide for the rail revolution.
Tax payers come up for mortgage for 75,000 pound oranges of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-house member of the conservatives, has charged the taxpayer a year thousands of pounds for the cost of an orangery that he is building in his home in his electoral circle.
The party's prison speaker who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained of the need for underhouse members to live "of magnificent rations" has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to build an oak woodwork building at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
Responsible members of the sub-house approved the requests at that time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditure of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-house members, has a two-story house in a village in his district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining rooms, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control centre of the underhouse, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a winter garden, which is called "Orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "Glashaus für Entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privilegies to take an opinion on increased money collection during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts.
Last month after an examination of its expenditure, the Committee freed him from the breakdown of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security of a mortgage of over 271.406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his district hall, which he had purchased in 1991, one year before his election to the Member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to over 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
Duncan's RBS mortgage interest rate has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase in the financing of the intake of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal steadless RBS mortgage rate dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the Subhaus show that Duncan continues to claim his property at 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his posts as the opposition leader of the underhouse in September after a undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the chance of spending that parliamentary members would live "of magnificent rations".
"In essence, it means that if you work for the state, you have to live with magnificent rations and how S***e is treated."
He said, "I have spent my money for my garden and have claimed to be a disappearing small part measured by what belongs to him.
And I could have invoked the whole fucking sum, but I don't do it."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former career as an oil-gross trader, was attacked in May for the first time because of his expenditure, as it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had decided with the Fees Office that this could be considered "as exaggerated demand".
One activist, as a protest in Duncans Rasen, has digged a hole in the form of a pound mark, after it has become known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) for over three years.
When he was asked about the elevated mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by the Fees Office, as well as following Legg's approval for the increase of value."
He added: "There is no debate about retirement and penetration or a ban on rules or similar.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer at all."
Come all your believers to admire Brighton's beach hut advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new content of life for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries by creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages with Christmas songs as a theme for every December.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free bulb wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruits.
The until now selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary minister of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to call for an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have taken several hundreds of arrests.
According to police, at least thirty thousand people, according to the organizers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force from 2013 until Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, increasing mobilisation in the world contributes to the climate, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, had collapsed windows with patch stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-unrest police have taken in immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your opinion, were arrested mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, this extremely violent splitter groups, which have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has held the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers were arrested "without distinction", strongly criticized, and has underlined that about a hundred of you were "still in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and insitting position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to be able to welcome the spokesmen for an evening with candlelight, taking part in the former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have arrived with buses and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, and some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of you with sky-blue rainmass, have made a first run in Copenhagen in the morning, since you have followed the call of the Earth's friends "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we go to the streets to demand a reconciliation of the ecological debt in favour of the south, said Lidy Nacpil, philippinic activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue this way and say that we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, where you can walk, as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
The European Parliamentary José Bové, formed by the globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "call image law and social justice", "Today there are no differences between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific area, where many islands are particularly threatened by warming, has given the start of demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people went to the streets.
In Manila there were some hundreds of people, mostly students marched in red and hated bandanas in which you celebrated sun energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, a number of hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (South), in Lille (Nord), in Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abchasien has chosen his president, Georgia denounced that it is a "stroke" here.
Abchasien chose his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian area as self-employed, Tbilissi denounced the "Streich".
Some 13000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of the South-Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist area recognised by Russia.
The election locations have closed GMT at 17 a.m.
The election participation was about 58% a few hours before the electoral closure, according to the Abchasian Election Commission responsible.
The first premature results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abchasien is now under Russian total occupation, has explained his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognized the self-employment of this region with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia, which is occupied by Russia.
After it had been separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, several thousands of people died, Abchasia wishes to prove that it is willing to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have chosen for Herrn Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who chose to choose in a electoral location located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms before the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the eastern part of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election execution.
We, the Abchasian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a presentation of Moscow's support, in particular with regard to the decision to recognise Abchasien's self-employment.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, and Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered a glass of Wodka.
The opposition on its part, represented by the former Vice President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year, such as the one in which Abchasien Russia leaves the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one voice is necessary to win the choice.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of elections must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to request an ambitious and binding treaty from the purchased climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
According to police, thirty thousand people, according to the organizers, have demonstrated hundreds of thousands in the afternoon halls in the Danish capital, which receives the delegates from 193 countries that are looking for an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to invade.
A stage was built to welcome the spokesmen for an evening with candlelight, taking part in the former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were dressed in black and were armed with bricks and with hammers began to snatch discs, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-unrest policemen have circulated you immediately and have taken care of by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and clarified that it was mostly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups, already famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
By evening, a policeman suffered an injury by a patch stone during the incidents where, according to police, about twenty people were arrested, at the chin. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in control," said the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces crawled in the air.
Most demonstrators who travelled by train or with their own vehicle from German major cities, from London, Amsterdam, or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue rain coat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to be a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "accuracy".
"Today we go to the road to demand that ecological debts be repaid to the people of the South," said Activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say to ourselves, we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that squeeze, there are water runs through which you can run, what was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation opponents has approached environmental organisations.
The French parliamentary and globalisation critic José Bové said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer a difference between the fight against erosion and the fight for another world today."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christiansen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific space, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to the warming of the earth, has given rise to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the words of the organizers, about 50,000 people went to the road.
In Manila, a number of hundreds of people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, before the city administration of the Philippines capital for sun energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered together in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organised by the 350 network, several hundred people joined, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the West and Lyon in the East.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycéen.
In an interview that appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", National Minister for Education Luc Chatel explained that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of Lycéen, even though they are not obliged to be informed in the terminals (12th year of school).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have every four weeks and the same program," Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the minister "must be overcome this hypocrisy" because after him "the scientific profile is no more a scientific profile," but in the whole, a concentration "the best student."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) should not become a subprofile of science," he continued. He stressed: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals, who have embarrassed themselves about the lack of historical and geographical education in the terminals on technical lyces."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) criticize the State project of the clearing of mandatory teaching in history and geography in the Terminale S (12th year of school with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also called on this project, as well as the Left and some representatives of the Rights.
On the other hand, the Minister replied that there would be no question as to a restriction on the philosophy of the programme of the terminale S.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for protest against the project for Tuesday, which they believe will be the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister argued that at the beginning of the year, Master 2 (M2), they were subject to a professional suitability examination and at the end of the year of an authorisation examination which examines their teaching skills.
They also conduct practices in M2 during the year and then teach a year before the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued to say: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "a thing that does not exist in folk education."
He reaffirmed that he wanted to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Superior"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge to meet Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", on Saturday morning at Ecole Normale Suprerieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
According to a journalist at the AFP, the noble prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts turn to the audience each with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach people and feel that they want to learn more, explains Edouard Hannezo, 22 years and one of the organizers of this day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students have given to fish in the bassin of the school.
"With the experts, around twenty participants were selected, even after their charisma," he explains.
"To climate warming you can speak for hours, but the core targets can also be explained in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only freely with the help of slides before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he pointed out in the hope that the listeners may find out that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific file."
The videos rotated by these conferences will be found online from 15 December on the school page.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will take place every two months afterwards.
Payment delay : angry prison guards, actions planned
The trade unions of the executive officers have called on Friday to a general day of action in order to achieve that the premiums and overtimes whose payment was suspended for budget reasons until January will be transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The second union of the executive officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on the employees who do not have a service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday morning before the criminal executive body in order to give attention to the "theft of what they are doing".
The 3rd union of criminal executive officers (CGT-Pénitentiaire) called on to "unite themselves to a strong mobilisation in the various prisons," to which the non-payment of the overtime, night surpluses and the Sunday and holiday surpluses in December is written as "shameful and inacceptable".
The first union of criminal executive officers, the Autonomous Federal Strafanstaltsunion (UFAP/UNSA), called for "all mobilisations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the executive body and the Ministry of Justice explained that the overtimes have risen strongly in 2009 and not all were planned in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims are paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice reported in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of the executive officers in which the payment is guaranteed next month.
"I know very well about the staff's efforts to keep our criminal execution system functional and modernise," the Minister of Justice informed in this letter.
"I have instructed the executive body to take action immediately so that such a situation which has arisen in the future is not repeated by a lack of assessment of overtime," added Ms. Aliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore magnificent, except for the headquarters who enjoy high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA for which the "capital forces" must be held.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille embarrasses and announces "all congregations and calls" to boycotte new instructions.
"The personnel do not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October are still not paid in December. This also applies to their overtime," threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more tasks are enforced, without more personnel being set up, the attempt to enrich the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate," said the CGT work of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not equal in all regions, some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is injustice, the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always distributes Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has pleasured with the TV-talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he always distributes better gifts than he gets.
In a special program, which was broadcast over the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the President and his wife Michelle showed how they will spend the holidays in her new illustrated home.
Even Bo, the little four-bone companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog of course also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's claims for the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she knocked the president.
"So please," he swore her shilmly and pointed to the first lady's pearl chain, "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour radiation in an unavoidable atmosphere with the well-known television moderator Barack Obama had so much support during his election campaign, the President and his wife also talked about gifts that they loved as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with ten slopes and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought him to Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father visited us Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the President.
"At first much later in my life, I understood that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady remembered her puppy house.
"I didn't even know how to order the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little popping house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for significant "injuries" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation is "under control," although RTL confirms that the singer was transferred to the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reoperated from Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors found "injuries due to the operation of a band disk incident", which he suffered in Paris on 26 November, so his production company in Paris added that these damages would require a re-operation.
However, the singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical opinion would be available at least in 48 hours.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was moved into an artificial coma to avoid "smalling and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, there was a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
On demand of the AFP there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that after his first operation in Paris, "no drainage" was placed.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a band disk incident.
The surgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician who had already treated many stars, has been scheduled for several days.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was delivered to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a subsequent infection after the surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, on Thursday, thought that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that you need "no concern" to make the rock musician because this "is a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him that it was a sense of vulnerability to sit into a plane for twelve hours after such an operation, which doesn't go so," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on the antibiotics" and that "the infection was inaugurated".
Mr Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he did not feel a special concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer’s health has grown increasingly since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he was crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, the general astonishment was mentioned that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer-OP", which led to an easy infection.
At the end of September, the singer took his long "Tour 66" as a departure tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer has had an effort to move on stage.
Only in the middle of November, the surroundings had to dement a re-existence to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Cursor: First place for Bousquet over its favorite dance
Franzose Frédérick Bousquet, three times a medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, took an international title on Thursday about his favorite dance, 50m free style, at the Euro-2009 on the short train in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m locations and the two others by Russia at 4 x 50m locations of the men.
Shade for Bousquet, who wanted to take after the world record in the 50m free style, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two king-distances in swimming, 50m-free style, the 28-year-old Franzose claimed himself in 20,53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually it is eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not make it possible to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater and in this case I said, if the world record is in my range, I'll try."
Like Bousquet, almost all of the swimmers started in polyurethane suits which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epos in Istanbul, which started in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-fold world champion in the Becken this summer in Rome and World Record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400 metres of free style (3:32.77), but with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a more serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Tomb at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman burial plate, calculated by the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be 1.5 million US dollars on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the III century after Christ and was always rated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysos are represented in a sophisticated architecture decor surrounded by Satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is surely what the buyers have offered most for so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The plate was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, and afterwards she dived pieces for piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and at Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III French Republic and President of the Council before Marschall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "Erbe of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's trip from Honduras to Mexico has been defeated
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for transferring Hunduran President Manuel Zelaya to the homeland as no longer compatible after this guided by the Putsch government had rejected it as unacceptable.
After a phone call with President Zelaya that took place in the night, it seems that it is currently clear that one is unanimous about the possibilities for this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authority, the plane placed by the Mexican Government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelayas, was returned to its place of departure.
The Putsch government wanted to require M. Zelaya for "deliberate" and seek for him abroad for political asylum under leiding.
However, the crashed President refused this because he wanted to return to Mexico as a greeting, ambitious Head of State.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a further failure by moving me to give up at my expense... they wanted me to pay off," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has often reported his word since the beginning of the political crisis that lasted five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and enjoy ten years, here I have my guitar, the crashed President, who had fled into the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, added some accord.
The Mexican message has presented us a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept, since it does not include a request for asylum, and on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch government, explained to the dogurian radio HRN.
I'm not looking for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had responded in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible trip from Honduras, he had underlined, would only be the president of the dogurian people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of an excursion M. Zelayas had mobilized the followers of the crashed president who had opened up to the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around them, thereby strengthening the military there.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch government.
This, according to its assessment, reveals the marginal nature of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been crashed on June 28, on the day of the folk survey organised by him to prepare his re-election, against the Council of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he was surprisingly returned on September 21, and had fled to the Brazilian message.
He leaves these, he is arrested for high betrayal, whom he is accused of by the justice, says the cousin government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organise a presidential election on November 29 to dissolve M. Zelaya.
While Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the controversial election, the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argenini and Brazil refused.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27th.
Wall Street in the rise, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high figure of the American trade balance of a price recovery of the United States' shares as well as its partners: the Dow Jones has added 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at stock exchange closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, has risen from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor’s 500 index was attributed to 1.102.35 points by 0.58% (6.40 points).
There are good news from different industries, Lindsey Piegza judged FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotically under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-full glasses", it relied.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, the investors are primarily fixed on the figures of the American trade balance, "which have improved activity in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit of the United States fell by 7.6% in October to 32.9 billion dollars.
In contrast, the analysts had expected a deficit axis.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the increase in the total volume of trade, particularly in the export of goods, reflecting the economic growth of the main trading partners in the United States, said Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployed messages in the United States have risen against all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, the mean value of new labour seekers was "falled to the depth of the year," Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors emphasized.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of public bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.432% from Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4.492% compared to 4.408% from the eve.
Cuba: hundreds of participants standing in power pepping "Damen in Weiss"
Some hundreds of Cuban power-resistant participants have poured out the wives gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day by political prisoners, and also a different denomination, which caused a good dozen dissidents to be temporarily arrested.
For the 40 "Damen in Weiss", wives or near-looking political prisoners, they were poured out on an open street of the government's participants under Raul Castro, just when they were on the footmarch to the center of the Haup City in order to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Lower with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionary!", "There are fidels and raul!", the authorized participants, with a lifted fist, scanned the dissidents.
The latter were shortened by civilian agents who appeared in order to "provide the protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Damen in Weiss" had played in Havana on the eve, where neither injured nor arrested.
On the other hand, a dozen dissidents who were temporarily arrested by civilian politicians in the Havann district of Vedado, which also took place on Thursday's demonstration in the light of the International Day of Human Rights, confirmed a AFP reporter.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents excluded by the government's participants under violence to enter civilian vehicles.
The temporary imprisonment of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As lawyers at the sakharov prizes granted by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Damen in Weiss" have organized an unauthorized summit for the "Please for the release of all political prisoners" whose number, according to the dissident list, is about 200 persons, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the Group of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, from whom there are 53 behind grids.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "Söldner" or "Agents" in the service of the declared Architecture enemy, the United States.
A rarity itself is that Cuban television reported the demonstration events between militant pro-governmental fighters and "contra-revolutionary" on Thursday.
The Cuba, led by a unity party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of ignoring rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of opinion.
Wicked kills eighty-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injuries in Clichy-la-Garenne
A armed mason killed a eighty-year-old in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Friday by late afternoon, and five more people injured.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old from so far unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knifes and this, according to police information, under the presence of witnesses.
The old man born in 1929, according to a police syndicate responsible for Alliance in the hospital, is the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he used a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the trissians, took in and was injured.
The first two victims were severely injured to the hospital, where the eighty - year - old died.
The other injuries are in danger of life, since, according to police sources, there were apparently vital organs affected by him.
The pregnant woman has become bad as a result of the events and she is supposed to have been hospitalized in a police source in the shock state.
The armed man, who seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence according to police information, should at the same time have escaped the road, the similar boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passengers, apparently randomly: a trissig and a forty-year-old, with the latter of both heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he crossed behind the back, said Arnaud Pressé, a responsible person of the Alliance syndicate of the area Hauts-de-Seine.
According to the witness reports identified by theAFP, several passers, including young people, have tried to recount the mad people.
I saw a guy in the Trissians with a green west.
Three young people tried to get in.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a cellar of a nearby bar.
A horde fell upon him, he added, including a city policeman who broke the wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the house number 61, two city policemen, including their supervisor, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knives, so police information.
The event has played in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main beats, where there is a number of shops.
Passers have come to me to tell me that there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought them into first-aid studio and noticed a claping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person, was injured by cut wounds.
Employees of the State Police finally arrested the man who did not carry any documentary documents.
The State Prosecutor of Nanterre has commissioned the district referendum of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92).
The mad guy was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard judicially.
A police source doesn't suppose he's being delivered to a nervous hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to join him on the police commissioner in Clichy, where he had been taken off.
He was "in a state of excitement" like "all spiritually confused of this kind in which the forces are exempted during the tathergang".
USA: Polanskis Lawyer calls for a renewal of law enforcement
The lawyer of French-Polician Filmemacher Roman Polanski has repeatedly asked to drop the law against his clients, who is currently in his home in Switzerland due to a moral devastation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney of the director of the "Pianist", prejudged in 1977 in front of three judges of the vocational court in the second district of California.
I ask for penalization at the place, M. Hummel explained before he added that the behaviour of judge Laurence Rittenband, charged at the time of the trial, "is running down a cold back."
According to him, the Judge Rittenband - now dead - had discussed before he fell his judgement with a prosecutor who should have said to him that Roman Polanski deserved breeding house - which represents a serious error of proceedings.
This discussion was launched in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the questioned prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally explained at the end of September to have the authors of the documentary film "belogened".
If the Court refuses to suspend the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands the leadership of a process that would allow him to present the evidence of his argumentation.
On the other hand, the accusation has repeated the evidence already explained in first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the offences to be charged by the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before court.
The 76-year-old director had fled from the US in 1978, before the proclamation of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He hasn't traveled to the United States since this time.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski must be "to attend the negotiation".
Do you want to disseminate the message in this matter not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused who escape is a way out?, Mrs Asayma asks.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court of Justice for a favor and therefore despises his authority".
One of the three judges – which now have 90 days to make their decision known – even highlighted "that there were other cursives".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the imposition of law enforcement against Roman Polanski.
The attorney of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the withdrawal of the criminal proceedings.
She reminded that her client would no longer endure harassing the Affaire Polanski through every resurgence and added: "Nobody in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Two-thirty-thirty years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the occasion of an American detention warrant.
After spending two months behind grids, he was then sentenced to the house arrest in his Chalet in Gstaad in expectation of any extradition.
Wall Street is braked by the increase of the dollar and concludes without course.
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Friday without course in a market between better indicators than in the USA and an increase in the dollar: The Dow Jones won 0.63%, while Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq has delivered 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Really, the market is quite quiet," Mace saw silver of Marblehead Asset Management found.
"He remains narrowly limited, the trade volume has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators as planned, which "have contributed to improving market views on the solidity of the recovery of the economy", the analytics of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US, sales in retail trade increased by 1.3% in November, thus two months after each other and far more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers has significantly improved in December at 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes were reduced by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level over the euro for two months, which means that 'the sectors that are falling down for the economic situation', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost a bit of soil.
The bond market has declined.
On Wednesday evening the interest rate of the loan over 10 years has increased by 3.540% compared to 3.482% and the amount of the loan over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates will cross the last hurdle on Saturday in order to achieve their dream: to be elected to the most beautiful woman in the world and watch this before a billion.
During this large beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already missed their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were craved to Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during her African stay.
This was a true scrutiny of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply extraordinary.
I've seen many things and have made a lot of experience! said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition will take place in South Africa for the ninth time and will be transferred live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, at 1 p.m. (15 p.m.) from midrand.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscoverment of "attractive landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, encounters with the press and Safari, the Miss is now focusing on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to imitate Aishwarya Rai, which was elected in 1994 and were both Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but this is not just about the appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defilate in traditional pursuits and not to forget, in the bathing suit.
The idea is presented by a television moderator, the chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-presence royalty from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a responsible member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows the world with a hardly overbound warmth and pride, insures Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, have made a Safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time, with the bike and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand.
Not usual for a head of State, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly still the extermination in Cape Town (South West) to the soccer world championship in June 2010, a kind of country, to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people that I'm probably never able to approach.
I will surely come back to the 2010 World Championship, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news to Johnny Hallyday are "Very positive"
The news to Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days there.
The news are very positive.
He's very strong, it's all running very well, David Hallyday explained the press when he exited from the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 13 o'clock local time (21 o'clock MEZ) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "fastly" enter the Cedars-Sinai hospital where Johnny Hallyday was delivered in Paris on Monday because of a bacterial subsequent infection after an operation on a band disk incident.
The singer was "this night in Los Angeles moved into an artificial coma to illuminate his strong pain and perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was delivered to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial episode infection after a tape shelf operation.
The singer had to resume surgery in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the last illicit changes caused by the intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, took part in a school event in the French gymnasium of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school on Friday morning, found a photographer of the AFP.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and traumatic surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has severely charged neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
We were told that he made the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said that they were completely distrusted, said Mr. Camus.
I've heard that you might be going to initiate a court proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "is traveling too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally called with this doctor, who assured me that he was viewing this trip as totally unproblematic, which had been very surprised to me, since I had two tape drive operations behind me myself, he added.
Shortly before he announced at RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artist environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematom after a brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with doubtful reputation, who has already been sentenced several times because of wrong operations and not to forget, because of tax deportation and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Chamber of Doctors, referred to him as "a man without scrupel" who has to be responsible "regularly" before the Board Board and is "all other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on his lawyer, Me David Koubbi, on Friday.
This said that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would be "normal".
The surgery "proclaimed no bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have been in question since last summer.
It is clear that it is too scarce for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), said Mr Camus.
The UDF Party Association (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and urges the Nouveau Centre Party to stop using its seal
The party's association, which is supervised by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, has heavily responded to a seal attempt on Friday, once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the Chairman of the Party of Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and, under threat of a judicial persecution, asked him not to use this seal on a document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had reached the left hand.
By the way, the Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
He had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now with NC), who claimed the property of the brand UDF, as he first requested this brand at the Institute national de la proprété industrial in 2004.
However, the business office of the party's friends supervised UDF broke silence and made it clear that they were not allowed to escape and put a deadline to the Minister and to the honourable Member under threat of a judicial persecution to no longer use this seal and to transfer it the property rights of the brand.
During the last days, you have made numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement to take over the UDF seal +, wrote the party's alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the Party MoDem and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You probably also believed that you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the slogan + of today's UDF +, on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, explained the UDF business office and called on the Party NC to "remove the name UDF from all material as well as from (her) website."
In addition, Hervé de Charette "was required to transfer the property rights of the brand to their legal rights."
If you refuse this, we will appeal against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and remember that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave this 2007 to establish a competitive movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the party "UMP".
According to the signatory, the Nouveau Centre has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la democracy française).
They continue to recall that the last UDF convention in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party as well as the establishment of a business for the defense of "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the business office continues, "was he at the time when he applied the brand name, not more member of the UDF for three years, but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of the acronym UDF, in order to perform this for himself.
In addition, you consider that this inconscientiousness is the best way to turn into a crime, ironing the strategy of the NC: "It seems more likely to us in politics as well as in life to make ourselves a name rather than to try to get out of anonymity by making a name in a deceptive way that one has no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Justice of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the Milliardary Liliane Bettencourt claims, he exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to slip out part of their assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his Star Photos, will have to be responsible for the exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a criminal offence which is imposed with a sentence of liberty of not more than three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the Saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter boast and at the same time have the tears of the cosmetic empire L'OMontréal.
However, the 15th chamber ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, jointly conducted by three doctors.
The L'Oréal’s legislator and principal shareholder has so far refused to submit such an investigation, especially not under the conditions submitted by Nanterre’s Prosecutors.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to present a report before 10 March 2010, in which you make clear whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have found itself in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I'll talk to her, said the lawyer of Ms. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the negotiation.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady that must be protected, he reaffirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal action against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artists, and accused him of having exploited the weakness of her mother for years to swallow gifts from a total of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policy or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, which she looks as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the permissibility of the action initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a large family debri on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called to three of his clients to their notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) letters in which she wrote that she dissuades the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Please explain to my daughter that I have written to banier for fifteen years, one to two times a day.
Françoise I have never been able to speak since her marriage."
The prosecutor of Nanterre once again believes that the applicant had no right to respond in this way, especially because in the last days a pre-mundial judge rejected her request to initiate a judicial procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legally capable, is not under protection and has no foremost.
No one has the right to act in its place," reaffirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to make a judgment after the process of the reliability of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic early education?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
Since over a decade, the attitude of the management of large enterprises in relation to its employees, the position of consumers in front of marketing revolution said: "values" for the personnel determines the best as it was earlier to depend on consumer products designed by the technicians in the work.
By giving the customer in the centre of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although authoritarian temptation products separately depend on customers' preferences again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to a fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the top of a much larger phenomenon that affects the employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of F&Eund, which is more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "requires a proactive approach and a future-oriented view of all the parties involved", claims by the employees a use that completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we demand an operational revolution that would consist in putting the employees equally in the centre of the company's concerns next to the customer.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion surveys
Will the internal surveys, such as the questionnaire, which Orange has submitted its reward recipients, encourage this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately.
- First of all, because I could find that in the face of a new situation, after many reasons, the whole thing came to do, first of all, what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportional to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Her interpretation of psychology is mechanically preceded by the large engineering schools.
By intellectual comfort, they take over the old behaviorist theory that has recently been reactivated by American "new sciences" and unaware of widespread research institutes and the media.
So and by suggesting that it is possible to operate the "hebel" (sic) to engage in employees, a recent survey by Ipsos published by Le Figaro.fr strengthens the leaders in an attitude towards a mechanical control system that is inappropriate to the present world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, a operating revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of control: for the recipients, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve some of its dreams, their honor and their projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of the motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a specified Doxa, which allows them to assess through their perceived image of the company what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and advance their "social performance" and place their human resource management back in the right place.
Thus they create a fertile soil that is beneficial to the development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama praise from the right
On Friday, the American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama on the eve in Oslo and were satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 defended the concept of the "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who mocked the allocation of the prize to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the president's speech, following the example of the former Vice-President-Candidate in the 2008 elections of Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today, adding that they themselves had made the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in their memories just published.
Of course, the war is the last of which I think the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; one way to explain his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, argued that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, this speech was quite historical, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio program "The Takeaway".
The previous Member, who is regarded as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "president of the Left", who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and could not give a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to representing himself as a "cosmopolitan" as "he always does it," he "speaked like an American president" when he pointed out that the Europeans "life as in a security bubble that they have not created themselves and do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few, unconvincing rights, the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a falke of the era Bush, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "long time, high night and inspirationless".
On the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is worried about how Barack Obama defends the retirement of the forces.
When the war is packed under the cover of the justice, the massacre can be justified to the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the educated left remains praised by the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, described the speech for a speaker like him, known for his talent, as "Monumentalwerk".
The speech in Oslo "provides a schedule for controlling international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," said the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and describes his speech as "different and exemplary at the same time".
Fernfahrer: Three Marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike command and the threatening heavy supply passport to Christmas.
At the signature session on Friday evening, the State Secretary of State Dominique Bussereau, "greeted" the agreement that was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second negotiation night, the negotiators separated themselves on the early Friday morning in the hope of quickly signing the agreement on the late morning.
And that even though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, there were more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 p.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed only at 18:00 p.m.
The conflict "has caused a lot of damage to the company" and "it was to be afraid that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages is thus increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"This is not particularly much, but we first start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now required to stop blocking the supply centres.
"There will probably always be some disagreements that are not satisfied with the agreement," he complements.
The TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was difficult to admit these wage increases in the face of international competition.
According to him, the increase of 170 euros is monthly for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on the healthy human mind and respect for the employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), against whom Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for an increase in the cost of travel by 3 % as well as for the maintenance of the total road transport package in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable it to deal with the 13th monthly content and the modernisation of tariff contracts.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the payments for employers amounting to EUR 100 million" were subject to an amendment by the government to the 2009 draft law of the corrected finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly in the night from Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for a "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement first to apply to the companies associated with this organisation and then to apply to the entire status of employment in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time," assures Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association prescribed a "deceptive trade" because the EUR 100 million "was already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to drift the Gans-Essers on the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens to "shuw the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest highway network in France for the Grand Chamber of Paris and the Île-de-France, continued during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris passenger transport management), which continues to wait strikers with their demands for wages.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central track (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central trajectory was only one of four trains ready.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travelers to climb.
The shop house chain of Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the large businesses to traffic technology".
The line RER A passes through the Paris Balling Area from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains to the main time of transport was scheduled, and almost no one during the poor time of traffic.
As on Thursday, there was no human rage on the railroads, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had stopped the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less overflowed than otherwise, especially because of the lack of gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he said he would be extra "returned one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to care for travellers by staff and order forces, pointed out that there had been no confusions in the Saint-Laazare Train Station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers were again held during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had considered "daily" after the meeting with the leadership point on Friday afternoon.
The RER leader proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line as regards all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
But that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they demand a long-term wage payment.
The CGT was displeased that the RATP itself put their wage payment proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership point "is not able to solve a problem while this was possible with the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP clarified that a renewed meeting was planned for Monday for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "ignorates the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a Paris Committee.
Again, it was the leadership point, who refused any discussion during the strike until date, and pointed out a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the line RER B after an announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations require a wage allowance of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this route where millions of travellers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, which have years of professional experience, pay a gross wage of EUR 2.200 to 2.700 as well as a salary allowance of EUR 600 to 650 for shift services as well as Sunday and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court resolves pro-Kurdish Party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision followed immediately by anger demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens tremendous difficulty in the work of the government, which strives to reach the hands of the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts for 25 years.
The "Partei for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved, as it became a "set for activities that are disadvantaged to the independence of the state and its impartial unity", said the President of the Hasim Kiliç Constitutional Court, four days after the decision on the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been made unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to depend on the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including Ahmet Türk and Parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political event for the period of five years.
The Judge also announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity, which Turks and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the goods of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
The party leaders expressed before the judgment that Parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet unparty parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the State Prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP to follow the "Weisungen" of the Worker Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures "no link" to the PKK, however, refuses to designate it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal is in between the government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and to propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of Kurds in order to remove the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a relapse of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the imprisonment conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan led to collapse with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators gathered before the premises of the DTP in the million city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, mostly populated by Kurds.
The order forces used tear gas granates and water lamps when the demonstrators began to throw molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Türk assumed that the decision of the court would "develop the despair further".
"Turkey can't clarify this (Kurdish, i.e. editorial) question on the basis of a party's prohibition," he explained the press.
The government, consisting of a party resulting from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose from principle against the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," says Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpetuation of the democratic opening that was promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously make yourself focused on a response from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced that seven soldiers were killed in the north of Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in the past months.
The snow break can come
A very cracky winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to shake the citizens, the Winter Service Director of the FES says.
Especially so that his employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be so far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is taking place according to a precise plan.
As soon as there is surface-coated snow in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A tracks with large-streu vehicles will be rided, explains Brauburger.
These include main roads and passports such as the New Road and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firearm access, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with casualties, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES begins at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be stretched in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better liable.
That is why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "so that the routes are free until professional traffic starts".
It's gonna be difficult if it's not cut at 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because no one is willing to place the scatter vehicles."
Only afterwards, if it doesn't go on, are the supply and locking roads, which also belong to the Council-Bil Street, on the row.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's foot people are being taken on the road, danger points and transitions.
The FES is usually unable to take care of all cycling paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps the bridges in mind from 22 to 4.30 o'clock, says Brauburger.
As it is on this fast glow, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, this is called by the police.
The Waves of Dinosauriers
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-friending dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1.50 meters large animal ran on two strong back legs, had a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sekel crows and a long tail.
If the kind had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be a special thing.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Science magazine of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was at that time in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the relative relationships, the spread and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began to take a tomb on the Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur boys on one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis of Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new kind.
During the excavation, they brought together the remains of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurier fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly you find only individual pieces of break."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
Especially spectacular, this fund is not, but he confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current study, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, so the allocation of these original dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the ices were divided into their three main development lines: the meat-friending theropods, the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and the birds, the four-bodied sacharods and their relatives, and the plants freszending ornithicia (Vogelbeckensauriers), among which, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus belonged.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found indications on air sacks, as well as the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air sacks, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitivest theropod with air sacks, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge saurropods later also possessed air sacks and lightweight-building boys, it is likely that the common precursor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the primitivest dinosaurs lived in South America so far, the researchers argued that the Echsen appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines were early separated and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which at the time still formed a single country mass as a supercontinent Pangea.
For this, the fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot originate from a common, emerging ancestors, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
An older kind, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonner paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted image, because in South America just a lot of primitive Dino fossils have been preserved, while there is little to find in other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant landwirbelts of the earth's medieval age, it is still puzzled.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the air auriers and with many other ecs.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relatives died from the Trias to the Jura border.
Success Story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition from the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite attack of a group of animals helped to bloom, which had developed in the Trias, and since then had a shade: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signers are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto are the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Doctors from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is a world-wide wave.
278 Professors and Teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarizing with the protesting students at Campus Westend.
In an in German and English written explanation, they "deprive" the police use caused by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the education strike last week, because walls and works of art were smashed.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judged, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police command".
The premises represent a "not acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimization and criminalisation of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate attitude of criminal persecution.
The majority of the occupied have not supported the damage to the property, it says.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German unions' unions are also solidarizing themselves with the students.
The protest is legitimate expression of a growing concern for your own future, says Verdi-Landesjugend Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse's Minister for Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of Uni-President and police.
We are grateful to the Uni-President.
Destruction and occupation are totally inacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have understanding of the protest, but no understanding of Vandalism, according to the CDU Landtag Deputy Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions saw SPD, green and left.
The CDU takes painted walls to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of discussing the arguments and demands of the students, it was cleared.
The Left has filed an application that calls on the Minister of Interior to report on police use.
New Silicon Valley
For many years she was considered a secret city, inaccessible for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had made contacts with the Frankfurt Science Site Riedberg - with the universities and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice Mayor, Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd, led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt Planning Decernant Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ are allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian science firms want to make orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of significant Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electrical Technology, the major companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planning city" for armor research.
Selenograd (usually translated "green town") received his name from the forested hillside landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgart Bremslotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be applied high enough at all.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply and simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the lowering of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will crash the city of the bathing-worted mountain capital into healless buildings for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headquarters with tracks ending in the middle of the city were considered to be a 19th-century traffic fossils that acted as brake blocks of modern rail transport, as it once took enormous amount of time to stretch locomotives from the back to the front.
Get in, keep a short, continue driving - so it's gonna go.
And that's why the headquarters should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located on the half-way of the trans-European rail-magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Herz of Europe".
S21 is actually being addressed now, although the visions of the 1980s have been no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost unpaid in the hessian and Bavarian capital to implement the deeper.
However, headquarters have no longer a problem of entry and exit since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and tax cars on both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction track to Ulm is now being addressed.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway also involves the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic of Taxpayers and not of the State Group.
The project can be somewhat justified by urban structures.
There is a new urban area, which - one believes that the computer-generated graphics of the planner - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The tramway station and road expansion are intended for passenger transport, which is attributed to enormous growth - typically 80s.
At that time there wasn't the competition of the cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must first be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as transport on the rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by trucks on the road.
But the new construction track is not suitable for freight trains because of heavy slopes.
Even more graver is that S21 indirectly also tangles many other railway projects.
Good six billion euros are intended to be banned in the Swedish.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is fixed that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and narrow points in the network.
A total of 60 larger projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 kilometers long route through the Rheintal.
Since 1987 it has been built on the trasse in the time-lupentempo.
Urgently necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake lock.
The Rhine Valley is the bottle neck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
The state government has left open at the Wiesbadener Landtag whether it will go to revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally examine the VGH original of more than 400 pages, said Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written on that day that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the case of the construction of the Northwest Railway in Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as the national government proposes, should not be compatible with the legal protection of the population against nightly air noise.
The coalition must decide until 4 January whether it is against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this upheaval and urged the representatives of the government to abandon a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered as a "wortbruch".
It's damn hard to keep his word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir in presentation on the FDP election log "We keep word."
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gumbel, attempting the national government to come to their night flights with "right twisting and trickstry".
A precise legal examination needs their time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal refusal, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As she represents the opposition, his group's statements on the night flight were never banned.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The U.S. large-scale banks scatter their state bowls.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund, totalling 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros).
And the Citigroup also plans to reimburse state aid after a report by the US sender CNBC.
The institutions intend to eliminate the restrictions associated with the adoption of the money, such as the limitation in the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had made a good deal of $19 billion of fresh money to investors about change bonds.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own box, which was well filled, among other things, by savings sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday evening: the money sprite has helped over a very difficult time.
The moneyhouse had raised itself to the climax of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also intends to obtain money on the capital market for exemption from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a heavy increase of $20 billion in capital, CNBC reported on circles in appeal.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to express himself.
In June Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Choice
It went all faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Administration Council had forced the official chief editor Nikolaus Brender from the office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the board wanted to vote on the personnel.
Peter Frey, head of ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter - official to prevent the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role to avoid further damage to the ZDF intent Mark Schächter, and this proposal should not be done by the Administrative Council.
Frey, Schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 body members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the conclusion of the editorial edition.
Two weeks ago, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, Schächter failed in the Administrative Board.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a defeat for butterfly, but anticipated.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Governing had signalled weeks before the election not to confirm Brender in the office.
Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had organized the resistance to the chief editor.
With the argument that the ZDF news broadcasts under Brender had lost on switching rates, he refused another term of office of the well-looked Chief editor.
So far before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was seized.
Lastly, even 35 national lawyers had intervened in the debate, which estimated the practice of cooking as unconstitutional.
Don't use it.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, educational and romanticism.
Afterwards he worked at the Southwest Radio and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "day-day journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since the head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint following the election of Brenders, which was still elected by the Medium Magazine industry magazine on Wednesday.
Kochs widerpart in the Administrative Council, the Rhineland-Pälzian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that intent's proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an exclusion of party politicians from the ZDF supervisory bodies also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended the Board of Directors with a wise chess train - by heavily criticizing the body right after the brake election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both but nominate him for the posts of the Chief Editor and choose the Administrative Board without suspicion of getting a party-governor to office.
In the party arithmetics, Frey is attributed to the links liberals.
Study is tormented
Partial success for the students: After a year of the education strike, the Ministers of Culture of the Countries finally started on Thursday: At a meeting of the Ministers of Culture and University Advocates' Conference, both sides agreed to want to improve the study conditions for Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
Individually, they agreed to reduce the test burdens: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students is to be reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable measure" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of audit services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structures for Bachelor and Master studies more flexible.
In addition, there should not be any different country regulations.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Culture and Uni-Rectors have been carrying the winged word of better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was first filled with a concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to partially reduce the number of trials: "Each module usually concludes with only one test," says a 30-page paper that is to re-regulate the approval of study courses.
With the "natural reduction of the test burden," said the accreditation board chairman Reinhold Grimm, "food development should be stopped which significantly affected studyability."
In addition, "study" will be "the crucial criterion" in the future in design.
Modules such as content are "strongly to check" whether "unnecessary indications of students in choosing the
Events would avoid.
The students would have "announcement to receive spaces that enable and promote own initiative".
The rules for the authorisation of new, but also for the review of existing studies are to be applied.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which, however, means that it lasts until 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
For this purpose, ten accreditation agencies are responsible throughout the Union under the accreditation Council established by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had asked the countries in October "with emphasis" to influence the agencies so that the filling of materials is not too large and the test regime is not too strict.
In individual countries universities and colleges have already dealt with the State Ministrys for appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate added additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
In particular, the universities are aimed at setting up tutorial programs and strengthening study advice as well as examining and foreign offices.
Country and universities want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novel of the university law to Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
Study design aims to be more flexible, to ensure recognition of performance evidence at other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
Until the end of the year, all studies of the country will be reviewed for their studyability.
Government and opposition had again disputed the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso High School Groups called for the design of education policy to no longer take place "back-closed doors" of the Ministers and university attorneys in the future.
At the latest, after the educational stages, the students as a person concerned should now "commit a word".
The future academics received support from the president of the University Advocate Conference (HRK), Margret Winter Mantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the HRK advised on a joint reform paper.
The union education and science (GEW) did not go far enough for the Bonner decisions as a whole: it demands a legal claim which enables each graduate to access a further master study with a Bachelor conclusion.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that enough master studies are available for the current generation of Bachelor students tomorrow with best possible study conditions, says GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The countries have to make a substantial increase in teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves to a more free access to the master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Incoming in Germany and out is almost no control..." is the starting line of a poem of Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which these in disturbing language fetches address the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom but at the same time lost its language space.
In 1951, Werner Söllner, born in Romanian Banat, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a child book publisher before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded several literature prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a significant extra literary look last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in mirrors and mirrors of their securitate acts".
Söllner, apparently disastrous and embarrassed, left a statement in which he was able to work in front of Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendants, Söllner had received the German language price in 1989.
The application attempts would have started smoothly, first in 1971.
I'm, Söllner closed, "also someone who hasn't defended enough against intimidation attempts of securitates."
The Lyriker Werner Söllner is a Walter.
Nearly at the same time with the Nobel Prize Enhancement for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literature scene and in particular the Community of the German authors from Romania is shaken by a case which identifies the abysses and negligence of a political system based on monitoring and conciliation.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say after previous knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his securitate acquaintance, THE Walter played a role, said Söllner's consent to literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "cracked him out" in all of the different points for him then, says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this note.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and before this audience, but the confession of an earlier dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not quite surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for securitate spits, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The affected, you may suspect, be speculated and in some cases also knew which clear name was hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the very procedural vision of the Stasi-Acts, the treatment of the securitates monitoring is still very different.
A systematic information has been deteriorated and disabled in recent years.
One of the Birthler member of the respective National Council for the Development of the Securitates Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but since then the release of the acts has been more slow.
Only since 2005, there has been a law that regulates the management of the documents.
The fact that the influence of former securitates members in Romania is still very large, after the nobel prize was announced for Herta Müller, was an interview in which a former securitate chef from Temesvar dismissed the prize winner.
She has a psychiatric, finally, they've only been interrogated once.
The infamation of power meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of speech.
In fact, there are inevitable questions to the case of Söllner, as often as it is in connection with unavoidable debt.
Why now? Who has been damaged? The sunny response of listeners to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the urgency of knowledge than by debt allocation and shame.
To recover the work of Herta Müller, who took the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than one footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It acted as a well dressed outside servicer from a very nice Christmas celebration on which a sports article manufacturer Goodies had distributed when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipor, rose a quarter-hour after midnight into a called C-class.
The man with the marking glacier was able to chase himself because of his still foreign city.
Otherwise he could also have driven himself - alcohol wasn't in the game, and the 55-year-old was just as little before luck.
Have been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work goes on.
Or just get out of here.
In the words of the first three days before, Switzerlander: "We have reached the eighth final", namely, thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we can't let ourselves hide from the success: it's going to be a brutal hard fight against the declining."
The "a lot more important task" stands ahead on Sunday.
Then it is true to repeat the king's class performance in the league everyday life in Mainz.
And the weaknesses revealed again again after the fast three gates through Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Exposure
The eighteenth finale of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16./17. + 23./24 February/back games 9./10. + 16./17. March) is released in Nyon on December 18th.
So the joy of the fulminant state of the Babbel follower continued to behave.
Not only in the supposed healer who had given self-confidence, willingness and enjoyment to the insured Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I went to the players and told them that they should look at their strengths, and I urged them to be more courageous, Soul clusters Gross explained the so simplely sounding success recipe, which had no longer served under therapeut Babbel.
He has developed a certain magic, Babbel-advisor Jens Lehmann admitted, "if a new impulse comes in the soccer, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week-long break of injuriousness thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the found "Phenome" with the pronounced "fresh wind" and the functioning of the new supervisor: "He is a man who treads through and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the present situation."
Under Babbel it was obviously lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports board Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs, however, mainly constance.
Like Gross, players and managers also guarded against over-evaluating the victory against an overwhelming and over-required defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening, gave Khedira to think.
And sports board Horst Heldt reminded that although a seasonal goal was achieved, the other one was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that hero had not been present on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory for three months, was the events of the weekend, which lived freshly in the form of a television interview of Torhüter Jens Lehmann, direct before the beginning of the game.
There are decisions that make others and not the Jens, countered hero the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had demonstrated leadership weaknesses to the board and decided to change the trainer on pressure of puberating fans.
Also, that his free day had been deleted after games, Lehmann valued as signs of lack of sovereignty and misgun.
Lehmann's statements were "proved by pure egoism", he turned back and announced consequences for the final man.
They're not going to be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with all the others that without the work of the dissolved trainer team, the playful and fighting strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a great share in success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-Fight in heavy weight
Heitziges Duell in Bern: Frequently provoked editor Kevin Johnson Worldmaster Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The point judge's judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the WBC Association defeated US American Kevin Johnson unanimously according to points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was two times World Champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately it didn't work with the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance sheet on 39 victories in 41 professional fights, two times he had to be beaten because of injuries.
Chairman Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
Around 17.000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2.02 meters of clitschko wanted to dictate the battle mainly with his left leadership.
The eleven centimetres smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the clitschko-era before Duell, repeatedly dismissed the battles of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not make his dangerous rights a decisive goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked clitschko with words and gestures, his beatings only rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
Before the struggle in the Swiss capital, the challenger had provided a number of wirbels.
He offended clitschko as a "human zombie" who "can't do anything right".
On Friday, the champion was then provoked to push Johnson's sunshine from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory to Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko was also victorious in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of age, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and "since his" WBC belts, which he had to spend before fightlessly.
This year he compelled Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in his titles.
In this fight I only got a hit and I am very physically good in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
The WBA's belt, however, bears the British David Haye, after it was able to throne the 2.13 meters of Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had arranged a fight against Vitali Klitschko for September before in the summer.
Its promotion company already plans the fight against clitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin called Defense Minister Guttenberg for false information on the Kunduz affair as a Lügner.
SPD and Left require information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent insights on the air attack of Kunduz, Opposition Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor at Guttenberg (CSU) has been a conscious deception.
The Minister said to the fatal bombardment on two tank load trains from September "know the intrusion", said Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news release "Daysschau".
It's commonly called it, he's lied.
The order for killing had been issued in the absence of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the NATO report that Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about a destruction of the kidnapped slanders, but also about killing two Taliban leaders targetedly.
In the U.S. air attack requested by the German Kunduz-Commantor, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to the Nato investigation report.
Green, SPD and Left asked Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor Office, Federal Army and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green College Renate Künast demanded.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm decisively rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's office has not influenced concrete interventions of the Federal Army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday there were also doubts about the representation of the Ministry of the backgrounds of the release of general inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have informed correctly and fully about the backgrounds of the tank laser attack.
Officially, they had denied the existence of the Nato reports and prevented the Minister of Sensible Details.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, they said that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense on several reports, including a two-sided document from the commanding captain Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert should have asked for clarification of the matter now, reports the "Frankfurt General Sunday" newspaper.
He hasn't received an answer so far.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not comment on the accusation and pointed out that this was clarified in the Federal Day Inquiry Committee, which intends to constitute on Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only are the limits between imagination and reality weakened in psychic sickness and drug rage.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's okay.
If we lie in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can devote ourselves to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, whoever experiences traumatic conditions in the wax, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is usually considered crazy or drug-addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a special one.
However, such pictures and voices do not only arise in psychic sickness or in drug rage.
Debt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes ensure that the limits between dream, madness, and reality disappear.
Dream-likely altered wax consciousness conditions can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case.
Even if triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystician Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age Professor Carlos Castaneda, Shamanic withdrawal conditions, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced to similar processes.
Halluzinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messengers of the brain is disturbed, especially dopamin, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholine, and the interaction of various brain parts.
Complex hallucinations and absurd thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no more power over him
The connection of Wahn and Dream has been engaged in philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristoteles understood hallucinations as a form of dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatrie, in 1861 found a "great similarity of misbehaving with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconveniences, abnormalities, senselessness of such a person".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and silent.
The gravity has no more power over him, he floats on the room deck.
He feels a step.
Behind him, winged devils with blood red, distorted fratzen, teeth-fleshing.
They hunt him, step him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Sound, malicious voices drown from walls and radio.
He can't bear them anymore, the voices that shame him and offend him.
Henning T. zips two cables from the stereo system, knots them to a sleeve and fastens them on a hook on the ceiling.
He rises on a loudspeaker and puts the snake around the neck.
Jumps.
The snake dissolves.
This should be a teaching to you, shout the voices in drum-felling choir, "go into the clinic and let you heal!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is chizoafive paranoide psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The trumpets are gray reality
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second-thirdst disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, affected people are usually no longer able to distinguish between interior and outside worlds, they are administered into an excess condition that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also rare.
The affected person can no longer be able to separate important things from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the sleeves for a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper consciousness layers.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is subjected, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Oberarzt der Generalpsychiatrie in Heidelberg University Hospital.
The Schizophrene is located in the center of the event, everything has a significance to him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is overwhelmed by the events, like in the dream, and cannot make it active.
Therefore, schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible to them, the trumpets are horrible reality, waking out.
One time in life experienced hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in the psychosis remains in principle."
The absurd thoughts and hallucinations are found in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain hits caprioles, researchers still face puzzles.
Exceptions can lead to a short time loss of reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic cause for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the solely defined factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimum brain damage in the case of affected persons.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a mother’s virus disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disorder of the neuronal system occurs, which does not initially manifest itself for many years.
Environmental impacts also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain is hot
The crazy one is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money for drugs to get those, says Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Box.
Whether fraud images are felt pleasant or uncomfortable is often only a question of the position.
Box has been collecting reports about hallucinations and tricks for ten years, last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The irralious world in our head".
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying appearances of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
These include psychic disorders such as borderline or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer and skull hirntraumata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people is hallucinating.
Halluzinations, according to box, are composed of memory contents that are normally kept.
They develop when brainareale, in which sense observations are processed, are overactive or too low; if our brain is running hot or even if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also riding, stress, love cumbers or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents indicated that at least once in life, hallucination was experienced.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there were not the pictures and voices.
During the break, it may occur that a snake boy with long, dark hair talks to it.
When it answers him, the fellow students look at it surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy, she's wondering.
But she knows that this boy and the other drums aren't real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are most anxious
Often the trumpets are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can't sometimes follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just introduces a new co-student while he explains mathematical equations for all other listening and visible on the table.
At night, the appearances are mostly anxious.
If she waits for sleep in her dark room, which comes too rarely and much too late, she can often not discern whether she is awake or already dreams, whether the pictures she see are the fratzens or the girl with the bloody cut wounds of arms and legs, appear in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, scream the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her that they think they'd be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She survived the Abitur last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from riding, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Box.
I suppose the brain is then under-employed and provides for its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, had as a little girl fear of other children, often she played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Papa, since she can think, is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish drummer images and reality. "Every experience," says box, "is taking place in the brain, the reality is there.
Halluzinations are also images that cause the brain to develop, so they work so real."
Also nightly dream images value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their deceptions as irrelevant.
Box therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as a special ability.
Delimitation between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and director of the hospital for psychiatrie and psychotherapy at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhaus in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, distressing disease, but it also contains positives, creatives - Wahn is also an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroide experience, a special form of traumaticly changing wake consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experienced one considers to be real and which he cannot differ from the watch state in the afterlife.
The oneiroide condition of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience a motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete motion inability, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a own imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of limitation between dream and hallucination.
As a situation is not possible in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is perceived in imagination.
An intense form of foundation and sense in an irreversible situation that enables us to make our own designability to avoid falling into a lack of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his one-iroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a cardiac valve surgery with subsequent cardiac transplantation enters on trips for days while his body is condemned to no movement at the intensive station.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: He experiences himself as a bed-laid, old man, on board a train analyst, a robot watches over his health.
In the early Middle Ages, he lives under adligents who produce freezing agents from blood.
It is dragged by a Greek on the motorcycle in its homeland, surfing with its spidal bed in the Firnschnee of the Alps and striking a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely on in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner travels differ fundamentally from every dream for Claussen.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental journeys are overwhelming to me after years and in addition details.
More clear and more intense than truly experienced.
The intensity of this experience leads to the horizon of our other life-scientific experiences, says Psychiater Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and drug rushing show how breachful our inner images of the outer reality are also in guards.
Every change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist's box summarizes, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow break can come
Burda
Children are supposed to take over the publisher at 27 years of age
The new publisher Kallen is an intermediate solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company in the hands of his two children, he said to SPIEGEL.
The Holding is supposed to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company long-term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at 27 years of age and have the strong will to enter the company, said the 69-year-old to SPIEGEL.
We have prepared the details of this.
The question whether they are active in the company is only after that.
The question is whether they are in a position to do so.
You can't introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he withdraws from the Board of Directors from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board at Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with Treasury's responsibility for corporate assets, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's exclusion, also those for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the publisher.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to "abbreviate 10, 15 years," says Burda.
The Holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
With regard to the cases of fate and Schaeffler, Burda said that also family companies are not sure before the destruction: "This always meant families who had been affected by a capital addiction that had completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never.
He didn't have world power dreams, says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Full Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, who recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in Callao (Madrid) shopping centre, where everything is only about body care.
In the wellness area, located on the eighth floor, you will find among other elevated companies such as Hedonai, who provide for a de hairing with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatment; the frasemen Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that marks through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
A relaxing massage together with your partner to enjoy and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" with eight girls on their legs and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, split for the latest face and body treatments as well as for the hydro therapy in 12 rooms.
For example, for the cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrant areas.
The fitness studio also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who care for the customer's training units and thus offer them a perfect personal training.
You start a training unit using the input of a personal password on a touch screen that is opposite the devices.
Afterwards, various videos show you how to perform your training units properly.
The director of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including warming and dishes) are perfectly sufficient to train the body muscles.
And then, after you have trained their body, if you want to see by the hairsalon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments are offered to re-establish the hair sprout, shine and health for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 22 a.m. at night 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and therefore it is again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their fixed dresses into our wardrobe.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has selected an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté, which can only be advised.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
The power company Endsa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the capital of Catalan.
The "LIVE-Büro" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements for mobility by managing, co-ordinating, subsidieing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is to be developed to promote the electric car and opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to promote the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endsa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are such activities that are linked to energy and, in particular, to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative to take part in the endsa in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of tranquility".
During the presentation of the Economic Report for 2009 by the Presidents of the Government, Zapatero reminiscent of the measures which the government has launched to support the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the plan on the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we today would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants," said the Government President.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automotive manufacturers to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also reminded that the plan for competitiveness, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided 800 million euros for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers providing investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models, as well as for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand in the 2000E plan, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and autonomous manufacturers.
According to the head of government , this plan allows for an average of 6% reduction of exhaust gases in the new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which, in turn , resulted in a strong increase in the "40 percent" authorisations in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: environmentally compatible sports
Mazda wants to prove that sports is clearly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine, baptized on the name i-Stop, a device, which is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 is founded by its good notes in the overall image.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its Straight Behavior, the mechanism, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seats you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
The game of the steering wheel is also excellent.
When you further consider the unit consisting of the instrument board and the armature board, you can find that Mazda has a variety of buttons and switches in the spectacular colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, depart from the nervousness of the German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can easily drive by car.
All of this comes with a large and clearly shaped suitcase room.
The stop and drive system is only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6 switch.
This engine is a real enjoyment. It is based on its purity, its quiet noise, its services and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in the circuit and its low consumption, even if Mazda is mainly the diesel models that are mostly sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called model Sportive is a special feature selected for the sampling ride, as it has a much greater number of elements from the series equipment.
From the serial design, especially the wizard for driving track change (RVM), which thus cuts off the dead angle, but also the control elements for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch velvets.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it would not yet be enough for equipment, the Premium package, which contains 1,500 euros for additional: in addition to further elements, especially the learning bixenon lamps and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Concern
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the diversity of equipment.
In addition, those who do not deposit many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative of this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21.770 euros for the Luxury model and 23.270 euros for the test-driven model Sportive.
However, as an equivalent to this high price, the Mazda3 offers us to the new highest passport every day.
A Premiere with a lot of Glamour
L. A. rolls out the red Teppich the sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, radiated more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too restricted, a device with which you can read only your emails without a possibility to see some attachments or to browse through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time to be one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is especially of interest to young people.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very affordable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of a iPhone.
After the company has seen the success, it has brought two new devices to the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike Peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise parat.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to dismiss all the data in order to read their emails as soon as you cross the country border or if you are desperately looking for a cafe with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but after my experience you already need a doctoral title in physics and a good glass to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission regarding affordable roaming tariffs for all over Europe remained almost always unrespected.
Apart from your own country, you are always afraid of reading your emails and that rightly.
The fact that a small device such as FonPeek (where it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it has no Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs, means that the telephone providers have to think slowly, but safely, and start to consider various ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices, downloading books and other requests on the Internet is included.
Without Vetrag and without hooks.
This is an internet-capable device and one pays only one time for it, namely, when buying, and not monthly for month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase possibility with lifelong Internet access as the Peek already offers in the United States.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I'll read my emails with the phone, thank you.
Especially I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
At the arrival of Barack Obama as President of the U.S., she appeared in a dress and a dress of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: auβer, that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, consisting of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and to do so she wore a little big-shaped or a necklace.
It is even so far that at the first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturia and had decided to wear the same dress in more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different from the type of fabric from which they are manufactured.
At the introduction of office, she wore a dress of top and in Oslo a carved saddle.
The accessories were also different: for the first time, green shoes with semi-high paragraphs and for the second time a shameful model, but gold colors.
The hairdryer was also different every time: the hair was placed up as a hairdress at this occasion, and at the previous time she wore the hair open.
75% of the mothers in employment have suffered problems because of their maternity
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This result is the study conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women "Fruchtability and Career of Women in Spain".
The survey of 9.737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 makes no doubt that 75% of women who are employed see their career opportunities limited in the labour market due to their maternity.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of occupation they exercise.
Those of them who do not work other than the house, work only half-days or do not have a fixed contract, become more mothers and have more children.
On the other hand, women move with a fixed job, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and maternity and therefore also have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the merger, which increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job, which have longer been used to achieve this, and who have brought together and the first child only much later.
In addition, the kind of work has a great influence on maternity, although less than the calendar of reception willingness," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is increasing, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they have only the primary education or higher education, were on average mothers at 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
Furthermore, according to their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with the main closure are already married before their first festival and get their first child, it makes the women with a middle or high school degree quite different and seek a fixed place and then marry and then get their first child, Delgado finds.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'OMontréal Paris has recently added a new name to his all-side beneficial list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will be the image of different products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertisement term "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will become another famous hanging sign as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
In front of her were the last who were allowed to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the men, the cosmetic company has only exception messengers: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Schauspielkollege von Evangelien in "Lost").
The award of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They all appeared on this occasion.
The Jerry Hall ex model and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model this year.
Manuel Vicent's poker game
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) to the thirty-three X-ray pictures of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearful genre (core biography, life and work), but looks for an appetite to the creator’s glowing heartpiece.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not save to fears or illuminations.
AUZER that this book is a delicious reading genus, it is also an appealing invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his sides, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual Trieb, just as I always felt it without finding words for it: the joy in contrast to the unhealthy destiny, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between ignorance and ignorance, with a thrilling poetic humor, without any sense, such as the knife that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was united by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in which the emotions of the breach of breach were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege in which was to come into heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922, which is one of the 8000 summits in the world's literature, you have to climb up on the north wall, on the wall at which the best climbers are always trying to get to the new."
About William Faulkner: "It was a strange cow.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the inheritance of a property owner of the county, and again again he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams witnessed a certain amount of greys."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the mad cry, which was screamed out from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo halled down to his literary way until the night of the 20th century. This made him on a journey he fleeed from himself and in a speech full of violence from the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled and blessed: My dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb these verses of Spencer are engraved: ' the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunder of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a satisfactory life one finds pleasure in death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was pioneering it between the Azalees or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man gave so much patience and was in love with a neurotian, whose literary talent was still much grueBer than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín Santos make than trying to invade Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroja to the arms of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he may put himself on this podium?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our district last week in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people from 15 to 18 years of age came next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we picked out of the animal home and weighed just six kilos, and then from the hot sky they missed him two footsteps and hurt him hardly.
Our disarmament cannot be interpreted in words, as it is incomprehensible for us, because the spass is supposed to be in a cheap agression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course executed on the line.
In addition, when a woman who walked cozyly, she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a mad man attacked a dog, he may also become the same with a woman, a child, an older master or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a ordinary quiet district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog healed all day long.
Of course, we have returned advertisement in a nearby police department, but we have great doubts about whether this will bring something at all and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the fought criminals were Spanish.
Our disapproval of the events has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what needs to be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on a animal that gives us love, society, and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), the tyre manufacturer Michelin launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially in the younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport security, which "proves far more than only the design and manufacture of products that become increasingly safer every day" and continued to confirm that with other actions, it also contributes to the development of educational and informative characters to bring this goal a step closer to it every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle running under the slogan 'To be or not to be' will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase to reach the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "an ongoing concern" of the company, and precisely because it always sees itself as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles that one of its main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small load cars rises slightly again.
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles approved in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008, and, much more important, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac manufacturer and the Ganvam car dealer association.
However, these good figures are only with great caution at this time, as the reference data used for comparison of November 2008, which was a particularly bad shortage year with a 60% decrease in the previous year.
However, it is necessary to consider that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months are still 40 % below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles from which the small transporter market consists are included: abbreviations of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small trucks and lighter small trucks/cars.
Moreover, the same clouds are still the same in the sky, which are most vulnerable to demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by individuals, the majority of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases are buying with a third-financing.
For example, on these restrictions, which are the consequences of the credit institutions' coupling coupon, there must be further factors, such as the increase in unemployment rates or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, financial support has little helped in buying a vehicle of the 2000E plan.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals but also for self-employed and small companies have a right to buy up to 3.5 tonnes of a small transporter with a CO2 emissions not allowed to exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it is essential for the state to focus on these small loads and, of course, on industrial vehicles (sustaining cars and car buses).
The car dealer association prophesies for 2010 a similar year as the past, for which it expects a 19% sales failure (for passenger cars and terrain cars).
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As already in the antiblocking brake system ABS and as it is now happening with the stability control ESP, the aid systems for braking in emergency cases must become a mandatory equipment in the European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light transporters, for the remaining vehicles a car has been fixed by the end of February 2011.
The measure decided by the European Union aims to improve the protection of the fusioners, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents.
The emergency brake assistant's task is to exercise more pressure on brakes in the case of a critical brake manoeuvre, which recognises the system using the brake strength performed by the driver on the brake spedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to a study commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not come to the Bremspedal before the collapse, and half of them had not burned off with full force.
Up to 1.100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, takes the brake system with maximum force and thus reduces the brake time and thus also the braking distance that a car reverses when braking.
According to a EU study, up to 1,100 deadly accidents in which fuβgangers are damaged could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would be even less accidents - one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented with human damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (via radar or camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time it already exercises a light pressure on the brakes.
When the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake spedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the page concerned will already give its consent to each single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there is works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the next days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car builders so that it will make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Gely, who also likes to buy Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, who has a Russian group of Converg back cover, gains a stronger consent.
If no one of these buyers would come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to maintain.
On the control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it easier for 80 kilos, with which he is now bringing only 1.275 kilos to the scale.
To create such a thing, they first abandoned the automatic foldable roof, which was replaced by a tent wall with manual drive, so they alone saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used by this model, such as the GT3 "distribution" further 15; by removing the air conditioning again 13; as well, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 litres, thus saving another 7 kilos; through the installation of sporty Bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch furnaces again five.
Then, by abandoning the audio system CDR-30, another six kilograms had been reached less and by the exchange of the door handles from the fabric, the missing kilogram was reached.
Although it is also available with the double-coupling driven PDK, the sample ride was carried out with a vehicle with 6-course hand gears, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain tracks that were really very short.
In his driving behavior, only the note can be given to him.
However, the reduction of its weight has not resulted in any way that it would no longer be so safe on the road now.
It is rather the opposite of the case: long ago we haven't tried so a small and light model, which at the same time also gives you a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
He's a small athlet to make his muscles warm at a low corridor in the required time until we give him the commands to shave, to brake, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again ...
He's doing everything you say to him. The car makes everything we're doing to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he makes it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the boxster S) has been successful and it can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the motor noise that has already been used in the Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutal, no matter whether it is out of the standing or when it is again accelerated.
The springs are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the land streaks, on which we were driving with the boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and that was, although we found some of these curves of ice in the morning grey and rollsplits in the morning morning.
In summary, you can say that there is an ultra-slight car, a car with which you have an unwritten passport, as it might otherwise be more rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be marketed in February 2010 and will cost 70.831 euros.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus girlfriend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of Coco Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an occasional starlet in the fashion show of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same necklessness as her pockets of Chanel.
A lot more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives himself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complex football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus come to the first place within his group after Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight three times the best of his team (29 in the review).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant outturns of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and team work, even if they had to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great results from the perimeter with 16 evaluated three times contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue reds, which sat at the top on the ads table from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria were already coming out of the perimeter, it was already known that they had come to the field with well-heated wrist.
They were English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava decided for a inner side game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received at his return to the team with piffs and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" assessment of Splitter is already suggesting that this would not be the best evening of Brazilians.
Nevertheless, despite the significant advantage of the break, the Vitorians had not yet been determined and the Makkababians wanted to remember once again that on their field, not everyone wins, and thanks to the ever attacking "hand of Elías" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to turning the "Gelben" the rower (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few tracks with secrecy to get air again and with one of them suddenly came the pistool of Mirza Teletovic, who with three consecutive three times and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that the advertisement board was displayed re-calming distance of (54-67), which the host was able to embrace at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavesen were blossomed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they earned honestly in the first thirty minutes.
Nonetheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, who did not get the best of their team and tried to give their team back by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and even though splitter was placed from the place because of Fouls, Ivanovic team did not give up, defended himself well and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being commanded
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take off the leadership in the group B of the Euroliga, in a game marked by the failures of Unicaja's players (freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially during the interior game, which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which may be one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts faded at 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olimpiacos was surprised by the intensity of the one Unicaja, even though the local team with an interior game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis it was possible that the advertisement board in the 13th minute 22-20 showed in favor of her, the minute when it had come to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action, and for which both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally began to warm up and his superiority on both sides of the game, while the excretion of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez were clear traces in the Unicaja.
Among her players in the inner field and the Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with his three times, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A pickup hunt was impossible
The third quarter of the game was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, proved to be superior and even managed to compensate for the difference in the Málaga game with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which again led the leadership within the group.
Unicaja tried to get away from the many outbreaks and excretions of the scotched Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came back in the 31th minute thanks to the lead and three times Cook and the use of Lewis to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, since the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket range, was not to be braked.
In the 37th minute, the Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase corb differences to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be struck and had to take off the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you earn in Facebook due to your profile?
The users of Facebook can now know their salary, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most displays of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, that they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users are available in Facebook to enter their job, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
After a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish employee feels "badly paid," explains Albert Ribera, responsible for the product, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross content of 45,226 euros and a French 31.059, unlike the 24,000 euros a Spanish deserve.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net content of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the most poorly paid work in Spain is the one cellar with an annual EUR 11.592 net; followed by the work of a seller with EUR 14.725 and one worker with EUR 15.667.
The most sought on the Internet in the last three months are the one driver, half-day offices and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its message in Tegucigalpa.
The President devoted from the Office must leave the diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 if his mandate expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegation of the Brazilian embassy in the dogurian capital, confirmed the TV Globo television station that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27, since his mandate expires on that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the ex-Presidents who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the date set: "My position is, as soon as possible, logically with the back covering of Brazil's government," said Zelaya on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo was a winner) Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this failed in the refusal of Zelayas to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician who wanted him to impose the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the most lucrative days since last spring, where the inflation of the assets was the prevailing mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is not surprising in any case, since this is its natural condition, in a environment where the brokers make decisions about a naturally unsafe future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debts with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly allow liquidity free of hand in interest, which move around zero, so that banks buy assets to depreciate.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as well as finished and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, begin to stretch some sand into the gear, as the BCE nac already suggested with its annual auction, the next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we will just witness to a conversion in reducing risk premiums.
The refugees of the stock exchanges and the differences in the corporate bonuses will rise again, even if they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States felt that they were forced to understand the private risks, and the debts of the State are rising again.
It is now replacing on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the euro area countries in Germany.
Spain has not been affected by this instability episode until now, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision on the evaluation of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain insecurity does not harm the defendant of the moral risk, which once again had attempted to renounce a consciousness among the world economic policy leaders for what they had caused, since they had disrupted the devastating effects of the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs when they were supposed to have failed a new day of thanks.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates to a tribal war between the empires to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was foretold earlier.
A government that disappears the government's debt, elections and a new government that is in the same way.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin saves Hungary from the non-compliance of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allows a euro Member State to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into the duty to maintain the stability of government funds when it comes to the necessity of customary licensing measures.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excursions to too high amounts, that would now be within the expectation.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European company bonus.
However, if the European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish continue to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
While the locally preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, who come back to a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, do not promise all this long life, despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "suite for driving" has been said.
Associated branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, appeared yesterday before the Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy on energy supply in Spain is debated in these days over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the Chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some tips about what he had submitted to the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, under the prerequisite that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this was not the case, the investments needed would not be 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that no longer should be invested in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
From 2020 onwards, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for the collection of carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW are needed more, naturally under the prerequisite by other "substance energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft text for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, was on a line with what his company demanded, would not say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
His opinion is that "on the long term, despite some" individuals, measures are taken, as the Chairman of Iberdrola referred.
If it is like it, Galán thinks that you should already make decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and have to be created a stable compensation framework to take them into action.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish flu company Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced, is set up to five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castilia-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol on cooperation for the creation of an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The Alliance plans to invest from 20 million to 2012, 50% of which will be from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the investigation of energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the authorisation of his first highway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1,7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A 5 kilometer long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself as a construction company and motorway operator in the country.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had decided for public-private cooperation (PPP, the English abbreviation) to advance the project after a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and toll management.
In the expectation of the tenders presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to EUR 1.7 billion in Australia (1.047 billion), competeing three consortia, in particular European construction companies, during the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second with its headquarters in Italy is one of the best specialists for deep construction.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium Northern Direct, formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructures and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which is back to ACP), which also has a local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, specialized in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises enormous construction and privatisation, however, has a barrier to overcome, since only the purchase of an indigenous building company can accede.
A strategy followed by the above-mentioned companies high depth or bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which must be pursued by the Spanish Baugigants.
Even ACP has only gained access to this market by its participation of 30% in high depth, owner of the Leighton.
millions of assets
Acciona is of utmost importance in this geographical area for the industry, in which it is already known as an energy provider and in the sale industry due to its activity.
Among other assets, it already has its large windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and runs the group of companies that were commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's salary plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to obtain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground toll line, which is promoted by the city's Infrastructure Office and is home to Northern Link (North Contributor), has the purpose of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the transversal line in Kelvin Grove(see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels, which is the largest measure for stabilising on the streets of Brisbane.
The map issued by the City Administration provides for the grant for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work next December.
Even if this toll track is to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that the construction will last until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two tracks in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland participates in financing at $500 million in Australia (€308 million).
For high depth Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia continues to pay considerable orders to high depth, which signed a contract with the government last night, a total of 154 million.
The ACP sub-company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400.000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet begun and the high depth has received 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it also competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
Initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has managed through its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2,1 kilometres long for a highway in Slovenia over the total of 64,5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received more than 130 million for the construction of the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria).
Alpine thus strengthens his experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the Sra Agency. Rushmore has announced a total of about three million euros annually, the railway company.
This Treaty also provides the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore has been selected under 16 agencies which presented to this competition issued by Renfe, 4 of which came to the final round, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and manufacture of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom because of the outbreak of competition.
The Competition Regulatory Authority in France imposed France Télécom a penalty over EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in Caribbean areas.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition for fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programs for consumers at the edge of the regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than EUR 560 million of penalties since 1994 for the disability of its competitors.
The penalty that was imposed yesterday was even increased, since the authority who guards over competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar distresses in the past and has therefore become retrospective.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trade page on the Internet with a view to increasing revenue from businesses that do not come from the telephone connection.
In principle, this site of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You must wait until 2010 until this settlement will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has developed its origin in 1992 as a source of revenue for the Fuβball Club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, which brings them the third and fifth place of Fuβball Clubs, who have earned most money in the Liga.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the Champions League of the UEFA, not only brings glory with itself. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
According to the UEFA, the Liga has distributed up to 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (that is 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since their founding in 1992/1993.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona benefited from this distribution.
The White Club is located in the third place of Europe, which has earned most money through its participation and that next to the AC Milan is the only one who has won the trophy three times.
The official Catalan master and the last winner of the former Europecups in 1992 is the fifth place.
The list runs Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams, who also took the most money through their participation in the last Champoins League.
And that's even though they lost Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries that could take money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, in contrast to four bye Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated grant procedure applied by the UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization, whose chairman Michel Platini has, counts on 1,090 million revenues by the Champions League.
From this money, the UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the precursorship (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they argued, those who were fighting for participation, received 3.8 million by their blossom presence.
There is also a bonus for profits (800,000 euros) and for a difference (400,000 per team). The clubs who have come to the eighth finals receive three million each; the four who have come to the quarter finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and up to 31.2 million in fixed revenues.
Barça earned 2.5 million in August with his victory at the European Supercup.
However, the variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned are still available.
This money is given proportional to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 places assigned.
The master of last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play in this year edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group has recently sent out details about the purchase of shares, with which it wants to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which does not force it to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In the concrete, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share paid for ten years and with an interest rate of 1 % per year due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares completed at EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euro reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives the shareholders a period of 15 days to share their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it has not been informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been in contact with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254,27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
When trying to stay at the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial crossings of his ex-manager, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal accounting test.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman who has a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created post, directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all other than free from polemics, because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of relocation of more than 230 million sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos shifts further capital over the next months.
With regard to the loan of the Salazars yesterday, ex-advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their determination.
CNMV approves the public expulsion invitation from Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public expulsion invitation for Federico Paternina submitted by the Investment Company Mer last October.
The supervisory authority stated that it had been approved after it had been demonstrated that the conditions were adhered to the lawful laws and that the content of the present statement can therefore be considered as "sufficient" after the changes made last December.
CNMV has also informed that this offer aims at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of EUR 7.65 per share, which is 8.95% of the capital of society, which consists of EUR 6.142.786 in shares approved in Madrid and Bilbao.
In addition, it was noted that 5.592.778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transferred until the end of the invitation to tender and whose price was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legal laws.
New vehicles review programmes
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the KFZ workshops are deserving
Each day thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops, where a consultant has to evaluate the damages caused and the costs for repair.
No single accident is equal and the calculation of costs for parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools it is a question of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of the advisors use this type of systems.
The service providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs shall collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies compete with the tool market for evaluation and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data available by the manufacturers is all other than easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales director of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are being cooperated, each of them provides the information in a different format.
In addition, the volume of data to be processed is increasingly larger, until the point that over the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been marketed over the past fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes to the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is an effortful task, because each of the Butthousand Parts of Vehicles must be catagulated and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a lot of sold model, the work can be completed in one week if the procedure is progressing quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Audatex currently has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain with full information.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road vehicle park, it is more than 99 %.
Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually professionals for mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros each year in the creation of these databases.
Each month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in a variety of ways and thus offer different products.
The most frequent use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for the calculation of the security or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of the used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, you can easily provide an overview of the kind of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for testing accidents for the advisors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for any advice.
The most expensive will be for customers who rarely use it up to ten times a month, namely 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that makes thousands of advice negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the mounting tape only using the drive number.
AudaGlass is engaged in the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional market on the Internet that can be provided for vehicles declared for total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or for receipt of information about deviations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be involved in the workshop due to pans or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt motifs is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It represents, among others, Gt Estimates, which is also intended for consultants and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motives is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions to assess damage, pans or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 advisors and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and sales amounted to 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of their business are being operated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% in North and South America. They work together with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, $3.35 more than in 2008.
To this end, the company has revenues of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2 % more than the previous year.
In 2005 the Solera group was worth 1 billion dollars at the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007 they have been at the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a plattfom on the Internet for the sale of accidental vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% in the next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increases, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This review and purchasing service is exclusively used to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, consultants, car rental companies, workshops, scraps and car dealers who must be registered before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and managed more than 600.000 operations throughout Europe, 500.000 of which alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 advisors.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose number of drivers has been registered may no longer be allowed to drive on the streets, but it may be used as spare parts for certain non-damaged parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be reapproved even if they have been logged out after difficult authorities.
Cost forecast of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, searching the spare part, creating and creating a cost estimate.
The ease of handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer technologies.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 terrain cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the driving position number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, charges or discounts and afterwards can print the cost estimate and pass it on to its customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool to evaluate such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the estimated working hours on the workshop do not include.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros per year, a amount that the customer can pay without delay.
The Audatex company is currently working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that Automechanics have been waiting for for a long time because, for example, you can choose a door with them and then turn the image completely to view the inside.
