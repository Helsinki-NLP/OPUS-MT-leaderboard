Triumph of the legal poplars in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
According to the first preliminary results, both parties of the previous large coalition and a significant strengthening of the legal population parties brought the preferred parliamentary elections in Austria from Sunday.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered losses, where the position of former president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the chippe.
On the other hand, the elector of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is equipped for a triumphal return to federal policy.
According to previous results, the Social Democrats (SPÖ) remain strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian postwar history, and especially in the People's Party, which demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had withdrawn from the coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage in front of the SPÖ.
However, the electors probably punished the party for failing the government.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about a possible withdrawal of the party president and previous Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party Board.
Such a development would probably lead to the most likely way out of the decouple of election, i.e. to a renewal of the large coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In the light of the strengthening of both legally populistic parties - the Freedom (FPÖ) received 18 percent, BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear at the same time that 1999 could repeat when the People's Party had agreed with the Populists (the FPÖ was still unified, in 2005 split by the GDP) with regard to a joint government, which had even caused sanctions from the European Union.
On this development, Jörg Haider, who already explained that he was willing to cooperate with every party and will be exercising from returning to Vienna to Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the Green Party, which suffered slightly losses, took place among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has probably mastered the four percentages and has therefore not moved to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it was not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused of bugs in India because of the illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg could be considered to be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasised by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this fails to clarify, then there is a certain cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
After the discussions, Mukherdshi said that in judicial matters the executive could hardly intervene.
In spite of all, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempted from the charge and received a fine of money, the central government wants to go with the local government in Darjiling, in whose case the case falls.
"His problem could be resolved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of liberty, Mukherdshi's opinion is that it would be best if he was called at a higher instance.
He could thus request release on deposit and, in freedom, wait for his judgment, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had spoken the same way in negotiations.
"He recommends a appeal at a higher court, then he would be gratified to him," said the Chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to allow the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, he reaffirmed the Czech Republic with great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
One answer to the question whether he had received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter was the Minister.
"I've already been promised a lot," he found only.
A Czech governs the rings around the sea ground
It comes to an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are portrayed.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent seaside ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-thirty employees of the UN Divorce for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His boss, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and adds it to and to.
Workelan and enthusiasm are here.
The marine ground has been a little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here, oil can be found, the more ore and other non-growing raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, bear the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A sea ground larger than the mainland
The landmarks today reported their claim to the new sea areas.
After a UN Convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay on Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental Shelf, which often enters the sea until a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental Shelf.
"Simplified, as a continental Shelf, the part of the sea floor and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the borders of the shore sea, often also the border of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be carried out by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation work.
"One of our tasks is to grant legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three latter countries have had success," adds Mikulka.
An international echo recently found the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sea floor which the Commission last week approved the country is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that will result from the use of the sea floor in the future will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also submit their requests gradually.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Convention of Montego Bay".
There, where the continental Shelf ends, the area of the ocean soil begins, which is referred to as the convention as "common heritage of mankind".
There's no other state in this place.
The right to promote in this area provides an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor, however, is not a golden grassland," refers to some exaggeration director Mikulka and adds that "the individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former eastern block in the context of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Convention, as well as the investors of some fewer other countries, received the status of a so-called "road breaking investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Still Ocean between Mexico, Hawai and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea ground.
"Fördern can be found on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich founding site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," another lawyer, Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
She recalls a small potato or, with some imagination, the sensible Shem, who has raised the legend to life after the Golem.
German special forces were on site at hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
For the circumstances of liberation eleven of European tourists from Egypt, more and more details are known.
According to the defense and interior departments, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Federal Army and officials of the GSG 9 were the Flyer Saffle of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal and logistics experts of the Technical Aid at the place of liberation.
However, as speakers of the ministries continued on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they had known signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate them as local support forces.
"Happyly it has not come," said a spokesman of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were dragged.
The identity of hostage workers remained unclear as well as the details of liberation or possible ransom payments.
The shelters have now arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages are in the care of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
There was no information at first in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to "Image" magazine, the five holidays and the special forces are to be flew out with an airbus of the Air Force and meet in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House refuses rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has made the 700 billion dollars serious rescue package for the financial markets very shortly fail.
The Dow Jones went out into the depth.
With 206 votes to 227, the US Representative House rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme with which the chaos should be impeded on the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called the honourable Members for a consent, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones broke up by more than six percent or by 600 points.
Reason was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after the failure, to fall down again.
Experts now expect further heavy turbulences in the international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, the consent of the House of Members and the Senate is necessary.
Organizers record rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel organizers:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even more than 30 percent for winter season.
In spite of weak economic prospects, the love of the Germans of a study remains unreduced.
In the winter season bookings, rice offices recorded a turnover of 31 percent compared to the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation by the GfK market research institute, booking figures are already rising for the autumn months.
Thus, the revenue surplus of the travel offices for October was about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV notified.
Based on these results are figures of the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and highly calculated for the total market.
The travel bookings made by the end of August 2008 were included.
Due to the weak dollar course, travel to the USA was particularly demanded, the DRV informed.
Here the booking gain is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the local fleets are particularly demanded destinations for the Germans.
In particular, Pauschal trips are high in the course, said DRV President Klaus Laeple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, "the costs for the customers are better calculable than for individually organized holidays".
Money could spare consumers, among other things, by early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laeple explained.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that compared to the previous year, a return surplus would be recorded – although, according to a further study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first October festival
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer made of liter-crows and promis in designer-dirndln.
A meadow debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much together.
She's blonde, television moderator and wears a tailored Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: Nearly three minutes on the grass, the photographers are already falling on us and cutting the memory cards full - very flattery and that at my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The Billy Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the Whiteworstäquator, the well-being remained in line until date.
But once it came to the Theresienwiese, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks infringed or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Rare looks at the Schokobanan stand only reap my dirdle curtains.
A miner reminds me that I had wrongly bound the belt: "Left almost free, middle virgin, forgive right, behind wiped."
Homely, I'm wearing the loop from behind to left.
"Pass," it spoke and laughed.
Others make less effort to subtle flirt techniques and wear simple filthy shoes on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist Attitüden is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "ooooo".
That's what he tells me after he has finished his pre-drinking measure.
Just next to one of these hydrants, of which everyone thinks he's a trash.
So Bob is one of the infamous "wildbieslers".
Others do not have the happiness of losing alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, sanitarians run in crowds across the mainland that must take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the shelter - always wear four at once a covered wear from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn investigators: empty back, full back.
You can't see anyone in the promille sarg under the plane.
"That's the ones where goarnimmer packs," one of the sanitaries called me on request and disappeared in the drum.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female footganger who died in the hospital after she was driven by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, resident in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicion of easy riding.
Meanwhile, he was released on deposit.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey wanted to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in deeply entering the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial striving.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the guides tell you.
The building sits riders at the end of the train station with a tower on every corner of the front and looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The entire building crashes about
But once you are within the occupied ticket switch, there is no doubt about the excellence of the project whose western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolien-Baggdad Society.
Germany, who was a late tiger in the imperialist game, had to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Bagdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist projects were paralyzed during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, produced by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syrie
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly collapsed, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolic, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tueki.
The governing judiciary and development party, the ACP, has introduced a vague new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, produced by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approximation.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the cornerstones of this new foreign policy, I went to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hollow ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new worldly state projects, the Ottoman past to return.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has caused some of the distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the main business office of the ACP, a specially manufactured ultramodern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping centers and kneipen in which middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to re-integrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The cold war was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from her homeland.
Today, she has to watch east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either the one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could sometime," I asked, "are forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "will not have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost every one with whom I spoke almost routinely pointed out: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can, in the transmitted sense, drive on parallel railways eastward towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rules Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too widely, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the station on the ferry that should bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least there seemed to be no doubt about which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth chor, Proteus.
He was thought for adolescents up to 21 years, but when the choir sang last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the chores to attack any piece of music that was presented to him, regardless of whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young chores was often astonishing, always thrilling, and alone, thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never read for years.
How often death held us "to let the music speak for ourselves."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings!"
His kind of conduct was absolutely clear and precise, never herrical but never overwhelming.
Whatever the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beaten to the ridder, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years, I have written criticisms for more than a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I have never been disappointed by one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply went home "with one or two known actresses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he reapproved the teaching of economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research stage in 1950 ... while he studied at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from a author note in Woodruff's book "From Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as "The British rubber industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer in 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and life' because its photographs are fantastic in black-white, in documentary style.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and the strength they radiate, how they always deal with respect for the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November Honda starts marketing of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large-spacelimousine is a much larger one.
In addition, the technical feasibility that enables even more comfortable driving and petrol savings.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aestheticly, the new jazz has a similar line to his predecessor, the changes made in this largelimousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism are to be stressed.
Nevertheless, before you start to analyze the new model, you need to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, has been able to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After jazz was released on the market, a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars, which are 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, which are 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the heads of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models a year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to hide sales in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with total sales of 22 000 models, which are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this growth in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda sets up the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axis is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown up to 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also increased.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other, to the central position of the fuel container, a solution used also in the predecessor model of jazz.
The capacity of the suitcase room, which has a system of the double load area, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation case room.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1,4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz case room with a 1,2-liter benzine engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of building panoramic windows, there is improved access to the seats.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 designs of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have an i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and simultaneously delivers torque powerful power for the whole engine running time.
The first variant of 1,2 litres achieves the power of 90 PS at 6 000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This fuel engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and 125 gram CO2 emissions.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 PS at the previous generation, it now creates 100 PS.
Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Auto-Biene', which avoids collisions
In order to promote the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarming behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development centre of Nissan Motor Co have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four layered Nissan safety sign.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee that can see over a 300 degree angle in all directions, which allows you to fly without interruption in their personal airspace.
The technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF) to simulate the roundum perspective.
It notes obstacles that are located in the distance of the BR23C up to two meters and are in the 180 degree radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a board-own microprocessor, which is translated directly into signal for avoiding the collision
`In the moment when obstacles are noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The greatest difference to any other system is that this retirement maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the leading engineer of this project, explains.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, but can not overcrowde; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to rotate his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way as it makes the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and abbreviation functions so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act according to these information.
It does not require to store the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres done, so it can continuously work with only a couple of dozens of KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology to prophesie Nissan in the next ten years in the series cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and keep longer than a variety of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite in order to lead to the target while driving and avoiding obstacles.
She's worried before she's stressed with a mortgage.
It must be realized that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to prevent US citizens from being involved in mortgage history of the allegedly affordable banks, a entertaining and informative game for the Internet surfer was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or perhaps, the hotel of bad loans' or the confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and specially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times, whether it is the moment to ask no credit.
And especially where you can do it, what is probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is more a side for the teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into their company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of their capital, a renewal due to a strong case of their exchange rate.
One week after a provisional agreement had been made public, the two banks explained that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley stamb shares at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is below 19% of the rate of the share of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will guarantee you a profit of 10% and can be sold again at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be operated on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28 % above the current price.
The Morgan Stanley act, however, fell by 6.79% to $23.07 by 17.00 GMT.
`This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a Holdingbank', said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing him to expand their businesses to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last days: Last Monday Morgan simply explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"Before a week," said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, "we thought that the participation would consist entirely of tribal shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will run by about 20% per share with a reduction of the profit.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares in one year if the latter are exchanged to more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, i.e. to about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds supplied by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, to strengthen their balance sheet and to increase their sales.
However, a group press speaker refused to make more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
According to the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a rate of payment of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August, his balance sheet has been lowering.
The last weeks have been hard for the group who had to watch how their exchange rate decreased by half, while the price for insurance against incapacity speeded up.
This price decreased on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the large investment banks at Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchasing of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic refounded around the 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezolan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorian Rafael Correa.
That third one, following the example of his gender and friends this Sunday, was the plan of a new constitution.
Mission is accomplished, because according to the 80% of voters' public results, 64% voted with 'Ja' in the Volksabstimmung.
According to these results, 28% voted with 'no', 7% of the choice list were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order to adopt the Constitutional Project, one vote must be reached more than half of all votes given.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exits of the electoral sites and a statement of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for `Ja', and 63% to 70% prophesie him.
In the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had, by the way, demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had congratulated the Equatorians in Guayaquil, the headquarters of the government 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in silence in accordance with the observatory department of the American States (OAS) referred to a text consisting of 444 points for the protection of the 'new socialism' for which the President is engaged.
The Constitutional Project transmits state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives widely from the promotion of petroleum by foreign companies and by foreign exchanges, sends emigrants to the country.
The project, which is driven forward by the Correa selected in 2006, also grants more comprehensive power to the Head of State, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of each four years, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13,9 million people living under the poverty limit of 50% of the population.
Finally, it also provides for banning the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorian base as a starting point for American anti-drying operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commander launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, which had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for 11 days, were healed and returned to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military support point al-Maza directly next to Cairo's international airport on board a special aircraft.
They were brought directly to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, on board a helicopter to be studied there.
They enjoy all the 'best health' and the kidnappers have not been paid a ransom', said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the Rollfeld.
After being captured on 19 September at a terrain car Safari at the foot of the Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought to the nearest of 35 unknown kidnappers from one hiding place.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Agency of Aegyptus, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, started the attack at night shortly before the morning burst.
"On both sides, shots fell, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest of the fleeing," said this controller who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian specialities had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is located, on the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian specialities have played.
`We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and of the special units', he explained without further details.
He also argued that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a terrain vehicle at a patrouille, where the kidnappers were from which they killed six of them, including the leader from the Chad, and two arrests.
The army explained that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfour, but the movement Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which is about this movement immediately.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current campaign.
That's better.
But an area of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will rise and approve of the horrible sums that are given to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical places that are devourablely hungry?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides EUR 3.5 million alone for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of the history societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 honorary officials, gathered in 211 history societies, strive to deal intensively with history, save the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage that protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments stately parts of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states of the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank, which has been incurred by the US financial crisis in turbulencies, want to be armed by a partial state: the three countries are providing a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the Bank and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level during the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the representative of the European Commission’s Competition Authority.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has lasted for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the bank could have a precedent character.
For the purpose of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The Bank will probably sell some of its shares, all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis have started a steep valley trip last week, and in the second half of the week, serious crisis scenarios have already occurred.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a pledge.
The institution's securities fell by 12% to a 14-year thief on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has dropped by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which, according to management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the insecurity caused by it in the markets is due to the valley ride of Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses have slightly increased.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director-General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find an interest with a material offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor is supposed to tremble for his money, it said.
There has not been any panic among the customers until now, the bank's branches have not been disturbed.
In Hungary the Fortis has separate branches, but it also calls leasing companies her own.
Fuchs in chickenstall
Because of the drug use of a person in America, life insurance and health insurance often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that connect the use of medication data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hand, otherwise we trust the fuchs the chicken" - quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurances shall determine the fees and payment amounts in the case of damage depending on the customer's health condition and should be estimated the risk too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical investigation and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick invented a far more favourable method: using the customer's identification number, he refers the data for the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, tells which preparations have been purchased, and the program calculates from which the customer's disease is suffering and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering medicines, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically sort it into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in the circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurance only needs to do more to the paper crème, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migraine and heat walls, but also depression.
The latter is, from the point of view of the insurer, a high risk factor, while the not mentioned above.
For the query and processing of the data, their own companies have formed that, before collecting the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do this by law, even though dismissals have not yet been impaired.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and combine them with the data on drug use. This gives them an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health condition.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a personal health data protection law, its effect is only subject to healthcare and insurance services.
The draft law was already presented to the Congress, which the authorities could also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard recognises that this is too little, so he wants to develop its programme so that the data can only be distributed with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned may hardly fail access to its data, since the insurance companies otherwise do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are just somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main theme alongside other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today the French-Indian summit will also take place, mainly discussing cooperation in the nuclear sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an ascending and democratic power, which should be given more votes and right of participation in international matters, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhis in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed yesterday at the ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and President Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached that trade will double over the next five years, i.e. EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing Civil Aviation Agreements with India were also legally compiled into an agreement, so that air transport will be flying in the future.
By 2009 India wishes to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the package.
The aim is to create a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one India, New Delhi is only in line among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
This was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides condemned to the worst, and also the call for a UN conference was injured.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides detrimental to the failure.
The EU stressed that it holds in its energy and climate programme, i.e. that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as did the proposal to close a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The price increase in food should also be combated, so both support the call for an international conference on financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's notifications, the agreement will be decided for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Starke presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for rights acquisition.
The international Frankfurt book fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will distribute themselves over the 171.790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary guest of the event.
The secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government in the exhibition hall during the opening ceremony: Italy will be the 264 sqm large exhibition room "Punto Italia".
A press conference near the Room Structure will follow in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, numbers, trends and perspectives will be discussed around publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases in the entire but especially in adult and youth savings.
A year ago, the little aircraft of the Milliardary Steve Fossett was found
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, which was found on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the desert of Nevada, was disappeared.
The single parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 metres, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the state of California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains were found.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully dismissed the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a troop was sent out. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The American Office for Transport Security (Ntsb) noted that a team had been sent out for a few hours after the sight of the plane, which identified the machine: the Bellanca 8kcab was lost on September 3, 2007 after Fossett started in Yerington in Nevada for a 3-hour flight.
Last night, some of Fossett's personal objects were found in California, near the border with Nevada, from a couple near her house at the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two models with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionary had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in the sixth run, as the first man to round the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew the world in a single flight without an intermediate landing with a plane.
Among its several records is also a 15445 metres high flight over the Andes, but this with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv that falls from the conventional schemes through its original design and the special line guide, the exhaustive surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroader to breathe the sector.
Just because of its exceptional properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort that will be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping miles of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the car's presentation, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so apparently from the poster on which it is portrayed.
On this, using the Elumina8 technology of the new Glk is illuminated at different moments in all its details in order to resume it as a whole.
Without a doubt, the concern of Mercedes with this advertisement is to introduce a new type of authors' clause into this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who are the Italian hooligans
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk the ban on stadium
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, who are now ashamed of all of Italy? They are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", who has traveled after years of the Italian national team and, honestly, they have not yet caused serious problems until recently.
There have never been conflicts with opposing fans until now.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The supporters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
There were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the soldiers appear: however, they were away on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a collapse with a truly legal radical fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans had been made 144 cards for the game: all were exhibited on name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: no one was under the trip to Sofia with a current stage prohibition procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, which had already been charged in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stages throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put one foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitationists, which could follow little more than 150.
"This fire must be taken out immediately, and that does not give such a behavior the possibility to justify," says the Viminal.
That's why, "Augen on above all also with a view to the game of the National Team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because actually there is a small core of Italian ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (port oversight) gathers the Casms on Tuesday, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (now expressed in no joy), which has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of the ultras Italia founded in 2002.
Although it is true, Mazzilli says that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise Duce, the behaviour of these 150-200 people was undoubtedly a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – adds No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are suspected in the country of their deeds.
So far, this group had been held in the tone, but now it must be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the pigeons during the Hymne Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but let me, but there is no education...".
