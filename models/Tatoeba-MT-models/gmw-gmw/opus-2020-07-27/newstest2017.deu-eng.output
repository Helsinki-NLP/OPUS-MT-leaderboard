28-year-old cook found in San Francisco Mall dead
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre.
The brother of the sacrifice said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "In the end it went up with him again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the court medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are going on.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had been doing his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked over his death and destroyed on the ground".
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our condolences are with Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia indicated that Frank was first living in hostels, but that, "the things were finally going up for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a great heart.
To connect his kind with his family, it was always to cook us something to prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swimed with the current.
"With everything that is wrong in the world, he was this unspeaked diamond that brightly shined every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case shall be asked to call the SFPD's phone under 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always being put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has now made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or getting sticked up from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself don't want to always be perfect and successful."
"Really, these things are more tricky to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress likes to spend her time at home, form TV with loose dott and Mexican food, says the magazine.
To the white glut, she asks about the child's wish: "We do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," says Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston can be seen as a single - parent mother of two sons.
The movie will run with us from 25 August.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are overlookable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little differentiation with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Goldene Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their celebration evening, they hunted home at the fast Galopp.
A mile at that pace, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses.
He and his family were led to the ALRV plant, and he did not even swallow himself for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was very convincing.
The German sports aid gave the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small Gala.
Awards do not lack the sympathetic athletes.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has arranged him.
Longer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means much to me," says Langer, "for it is awarded not only for sports successes but also for social engagement."
For decades, longer years have been promoting the childhood.
And so he also passed on the price of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-fold US master winner was added to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the outstanding are the lighty athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the turner Eberhard Gienger, the fighter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-father Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum of the handballer Erhard Wonderful.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrated society moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance to the great animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Compare: It's all about the money
Infrastructure investment and prevent TTP trade agreement - that is both Clinton and Trump.
However, the two US presidency candidates are unanimous in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The State's role.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to control the economy into death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, claiming Trump.
He will reverse regulations massively, and he makes strong for a broad tax reform with lower tax rates - for private and businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the State has certain tasks to perform, he has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money to do so.
That's why the taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton have to be invested in, say almost wore at the same time.
The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical teaparty flights of the Republicans.
So Trump could still have a part-time discussion.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more obvious.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and re-establish coal production in the USA.
Oil promotion should also be possible in areas that have been protected so far, the Paris Climate Agreement will be announced.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to develop renewable energies with its investment program and asks: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It'll be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.
At the same time, however, the US does not want to insulate international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They should be paid better, like Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.
He wants to increase it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must be up, then he says he must not be changed.
However, the great discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to be about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics hold him, so the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least of the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Flight: "Every fleeing woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen, four women are sitting.
Everyone has a baby, who is up to one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curious in the room with big eyes.
His mother stars on the tableboard.
Until she notices she's being observed.
She smiles shortly and kiss the little one.
The scene works normally.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a business leader of Condrobs, an agency for social assistance in Bavaria, and is working on the subject of women's escape.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in Munich north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-flighted women and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Assistance.
Recently she was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as a visitor.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say, every woman that comes here has experienced sexual violence on their escape," says Bahr.
"Men fleeing for wars because they are politically persecuted because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hopemakers," she says.
In women, other reasons for escape prevail: "Many steal secretly because they don't see any other way out."
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forces, honors, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what they're doing.
On the run, it continues.
"The fact that for example a bottle of water demands sexual action is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, is misleading, says Bahr.
Here too, single women in refugee accommodations would often be viewed as inferior and worstly abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in Munich north are traumatized.
"Some of the children certainly have not been born voluntarily."
Many women are so common that they don't say anything.
"Of they don't trust to talk openly about the experienced because the shame is too big."
Since they often didn't know to help, it only needs more accommodation for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
On the question whether they would know of a similar project as in Munich in their competence, some respond with no.
For example, there is no such thing in the government's accommodations in the upper pillar and upper francs.
Even in Schwaben, only fled women are not separately accommodated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press speaker of the government.
In Upper Bavaria, under- and medium-sized francs there are floors or own houses in some Community accommodations only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be held separately."
"If the privacy is held together or men and women are accommodated, the violence against women can be - persistent -".
Especially the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women are in the study.
How the women feel this need for protection can be read on the Andrang, which is on the house in Munich.
"Because we've talked about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistance doctors streak: demands for new labour struggle measures
Representatives of the Assistant Doctors have called on their trade unions to approve new labour struggles in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) requested its entire Council to approve more work campaigns from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that ministers would have absurd to address the concerns regarding the Treaty.
Assistance physicians and medical students voted in July on refusal of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would be "sustainably quiet" to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board voted to reject the proposed new treaty completely and demanded official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today has submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a current programme of escalating work campaigns that begins at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to the six-time streaking of the NHS's first overall failures this year.
The director of BMA Assistant Architects Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members that the contract should be beneficial and accepted during the sessions which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students.
After the vote, the health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be imposed.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter-player in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile worked narrowly and he blew hardly warmth, even for his restraining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had taken it as if something bad never happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me rather to show the opposite.
But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling shows that Russia's head of state hadn't forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the dismissal of a Russian fighter at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was whispered.
Putin gave up and accused Ankara to have fallen Russia in the back.
The wrong was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the vettrous will be difficult if not even impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media led to a severe, full attack on Ankara.
At once it seemed that the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious was the accusations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's territories, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He argued this.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could book a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was demolished last month in a failed state strike almost his office.
He was also shocked by repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90 %.
In Russia travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, public television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed.
A report in Vedemosti expressed it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the west, as it considers its response to the attempted power acquisition as a weak response.
In addition, the persistent grief over the cutting pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is desirable to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.
The Russian head of the state in Ankara certainly won a bonus for calling for support for the chosen government bodies after the attempted state strike.
For Moscow, this is a natural thing that has a deep-seated fear of change in regimes.
The summit in this glorious sea palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described, "alliance of outsiders": two countries who are ignoring from the West and feel badly treated and now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support counterparts.
It might be significant that after almost three hours of first talk, both Presidents at the press conference said that they had not even struck the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately refused to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator of Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and in the light of the potential for a perfect disaster, than NATO member Turkey disfellowshipped the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is intended to be reduced only to a backoffice roll, according to the bank's Chief Officer.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the global ambitions of the Bank.
The bank has been distant since then when it had to be almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.
During this time, trademark "RBS" has been used to protect other end-user financial marks.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbleddon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange notation will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business that will receive more importance - Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we do not pursue global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sports sponsoring.
"It's time for us to develop to the bank of brands, because how we focus on the inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Chief Officer.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and had launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves its 3,000th win at Newmarket on predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, bringing him 3,000th winning
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British profit at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second gain of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey, who reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He followed Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won at Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened to Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes up the joy when he recovers the victory on predilection
Two Jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached over 4,300 victories in a record breaking career.
Lester Piggott, who had nine times Derbysieger 4.493 career victory
Frankie is one of the best Jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the other in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6,000 profits if he was not just a weekend and big turnierjockey!
Frankie has been riding winners in GB almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition, he is an incredible Jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of big turnier wins, including his famous "Glorreichen Sieben" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to overcome his twins and return to his best form.
And he's not yet at the end for a long time - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competition until his at least 50th year of life.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly left his staff chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the closest trust group of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed a special representative for environmental and transport matters.
In an opinion of the Kreml it is that, without mention of reasons, Putin "has ordered Ivanov's release of his duties as president of the Russian presidential administration".
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's alternate since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he completed the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kreml's website, it is said (in Russian), that he was later head of the protocol and staff of the government staff.
He said about his appointment to Putin, "Thank you for your confidence."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as Head of State on drafts of law and controls for the implementation of your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putins' closest trusted people for a long time and works as he works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As head of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of the staff resigned on his own request.
But despite the smile for the camera, only a few are convinced of this - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one currently knows that.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president at once wished to lead Russian environmental policy - came to great scepticism.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust me this very complicated post - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been president of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his alternate.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.
Once Ivanov was assumed that after Putin's second term I could become President of Russia, since a third term of office had violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close, close ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was part of a physical debate last month at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his cancellation in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized in the public on Thursday before the notice of his cancellation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Details about how the character of Gibsons from the series followed by a team of FBI agents are described are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who used to play in Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been part of the series since the first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart blood in the last twelve years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelfth season is set on 28 September.
Puzzles to fish landing in garden in Banff
An inhabitant of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandale that was poured out by a spring fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches of long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: bridge now connected with fife
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Deck of Queensferry Crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "Deck Blows" which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 ropes.
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passing.
Overall, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete gun for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Construktors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.
With this fantastic project, the closure represents high and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection to the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the remaining gaps on the north or the countryside.
This was achieved by dragging the north bridge of the bridge of the bridge of the bridge of the bridge of the bulk of the bulk of the bulk of the bulk of the bulk.
This was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a rise of about 3 %.
Hekel, since the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they only had a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything was very good.
Salvation in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "being happy yet to be alive"
Three men have "being happy to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit at 13:20 BST alarm on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swiming in safety, while their boat moved out of their own strength.
"We saw the boat turn around and imagined the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have already wounded the boat beyond its reach until we let water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found on a Boje hanging without a rescue west.
They all arrived on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have been lucky and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it dissolved from the person who managed the boat at the boat’s headquarters.
Someone's been watching about these men today.
Seriously injured - man raises his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-friend in Hamburg with a knife and severely hurt.
As the police told yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized offender cut the clothing of his ex-friend.
When this came into the apartment, he put on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and body.
The police could arrest the offender.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-friend's clothes, he called his mother.
This alarmed his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-olds wanted to calm down her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her companion.
On the street they met the man's ex-life partner.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-friend.
Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens think that investors will be much more obliged to be taken into account in the future.
How to respond to the bad message that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "trading concept of living" at the next Council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
Firstly, the question is: who should actually build the favourable apartments?
There has been no regulation until now.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: Who wants to build on urban areas will need to show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also arise in stock.
However, Bratmann said: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments as possible."
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann, "There is currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
Left wants harder conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market was intensified.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More personnel is needed.
It's unclear whether we'll get the professionals.
However, the programme is not entirely available: because the about 1260 new apartments, which should be built at all.
But how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 favourable apartments whose promotion will expire in the next years?
It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning spokesman Nicole Palm, the city should now buy outgoing bonds.
In addition, it would have to be thought about getting apartments back to the price bond.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved at a time.
For in the western city there are deadlines for the end of the year.
About 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price bond for cheap apartments.
Only: The owners, the housing companies do not want that.
Because the number of social housings in the western city is again drastically increased, one is removed from the goal of so-called mixing.
There is no longer a concentration of social weaknesses in a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will be still movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on the boot."
They have concentrated on more buildings for one-family houses.
But what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet.
Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go it's about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and last to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities in the outside do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later developed from it a drawing series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
How many phenomena of the pop culture decreased interest before publishing the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand early July.
The introduction of the market into other countries was moved by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than tigers and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photonized" (with a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the madness and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person defers every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who train 30 minutes each day, ran from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays from Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public education campaigns to health that people want to "take 30 minutes, to come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" have come on deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look distressing.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overviewed.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances to suffer from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of advantages that is too long to apply it here.
But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.
So three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on hunting.
Likewise, there are murric game decayers that have always to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run at a door.
What are you doing?
It happened a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps such as Fitbit had already been able to follow our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sports as this game does.
The new one will lose its attraction and the use will slow down with time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the become active in the real world and will help many people hunting to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's tours
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamically on the pedestrian.
Hardly on the bar.
Breathless on the ground.
It's brilliant on the whole line.
And now, too, Olympiager.
The 19-year-old American tournament cloomed on Thursday to the multi-competition title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the swewbebar during the single multi-competence of women in the art tours at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-competitive title and a total of the fifth, while strengthening its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey found an end at this moment.
This success puts it in the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sports for the last three years, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambitiousness and precision that the 1984 olemy gentleman Mary Lou Retton said she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final examination in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of over-dimensioned expectations.
Not with a handful of gold returning to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman embrace after each of them gained gold and silver in the single multi-competence of women in the Art Towers at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as call signs at the graduation of the retirement team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles was on it, during their long way to the top, never to have planned the future, that is not really true.
Some of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - are tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, which was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tournament hall where Boorman trained.
She has lost no more competition since summer 2013, a victory series that will stop as long as Biles wishes.
Even if Mustafina led lightly through two rotations, the picture deceived.
Swivel bars and soil towers - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lauded.
She again picked up with 15,433 on the swabbar - and put one on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman embraced her gentlely when they expected her endeavour - a pure formality - and tears flowed on beles shining red, white and blue eyelines, when the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tibreak.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her soil exercise, she threw to the audience kissing hand, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
With regard to Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in series murder when listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first series murder of Phoenix while they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The killer fired eight shots from a hand firearm while standing on the side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, read the report.
The police informed that the threefold murder does not seem to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2.900, which were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to get a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people were killed in hispian residential areas within four months in nine attacks and two more were injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The intermitters refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of their injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car to hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the threefold murder and was assumed that it was the work of the series killer.
Investigators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund microcephalie, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I can't do that.
I can't do that.
That's what I didn't want to do.
What's wrong at all -- of course, you've come to it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund may never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institutionalize him.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know that people are still doing'," said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of walking.
Edmund could not sit or crab until his third year of life, and he can still not speak.
But he's slowly making progress.
He can run with support and cycling.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund for "Please sing me something ahead."
"We are teaching him a sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund has invented some characters alone.
Microcephalie has a wide range of causes: genetics such as Edmund and virus infections such as Mases or Zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary considerably.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't been asking for the forecast for a long time, because I don't expect her to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Severe rainfall, flooding gives occasion for salvation in Louisiana, Mississippi
Several rainfalles and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is expected all Saturday with more rainfall.
Numerous rivers in the southeast Louisianas and the south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened to extreme rainfall, reports the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that government officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, informed that the requests for flooding vehicles, boats and sand bags increased.
Steele said that alone the municipality of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sand sacks.
A flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, which are both in Louisiana, will most likely reach over the weekend record level.
The meteologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a flow downward flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest position ever recorded on Friday at 9.00.
Rescue teams still poured people from the flood water into the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his step son were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said another step son who lived nearby had warned him.
"We wake up and the water flowed and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they had been housed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "swiftly spread" since there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities would consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer reported from midnight to Friday from 13.75 inches of rain near Livingstone.
Krautmann said that the ground had been substantially accomplished by the rainfalls since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and a failure to learn in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.
The chief of the community of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were established to accommodate the evacuates.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the city of Hammond the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sand sacks were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," Lacy Landrum said from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said that it continued to rain on the golf coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses should have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but on Friday, no report has been made until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "lowered by balls", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several shot injurys, including in the lung, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was at consciousness during his transportation to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was hollowed by balls," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe that.
The boy’s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the sender that he was expected to be restored.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Also, three men were shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims, according to CBS Philadelphia, are in stable state.
The boy was shot on the front of a car along with the 29-year-old in a critical condition, reports the sender.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police figured whether one of the offenders could be injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there seemed to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Pattern shells for storm guns that were traced to various storm weapons overlooked the crime site.
It seems that this has been clearly a constant struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the roadway, there were trousers.
So there seemed to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved," said Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi to the police in Philadelphia to the station.
Several houses and vehicles were also met in the area.
No arrests were made and the police are currently checking the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another six-year-old girl was hit by a cross-seater on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's olympia team in the turning, for more than one reason.
First, I have been in every summer Olympiad since 1984, and the USA have never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three turning women, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, which Aly Raisman is Jewish and rounds Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has fortified the black and hispanese female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among female turners was an Afro American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner, and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they supplied unexpected, but mastery gymastic routines.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-competition event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the top of this sport, but that's not how tour classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic Team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will have only four turning women in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality looks like turning is a expensive sport and turners are primarily in private tournaments that will be maintained by parents for training, furnishing, traveling, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their tournaments and families).
The majority of these tournaments are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these associations, the tournaments receive their entire training and that is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started turning.
We need to allow the communities to be countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to be more lucrative and easily accessible.
I founded my 20-year-old turning foundation.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanese) and trained national and international victories.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality youth tours that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in turning and that's great.
It's so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.
That's such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic Gold of Team and thanks, so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated her to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistists want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a election rejected him.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract forcefully and said that the NHS was in a "Nomandsland" and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care at ungastic times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistance Medicinal Affairs, announced last night in a communication: "Assistant physicians still have serious concerns on the proposed contract, in particular that it will heal the current worker crisis and absurd to treat all doctors properly."
For only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty, progress must be made and time expires.
Efforts from the BMA to resolve the disputes through discussions have resulted in a reluctance to participate in the government and at times on the silence of hurry.
This happened to the promise Jeremy Hunt had only made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift up the force and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he fails to do this, the Assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further labour fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a rise of almost 13.000 routine operations and 100.000 dates, since nurses and specialists were included to grant doctors on the strike post chain coverage.
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to pay a better weekend reward for the 54,000 assistants subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director-general of NHS staff, asked the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Working fighting does not achieve anything but already stressing overloaded teams and service providers and prepare only concerns, need and interruption to patients, nurses and their families."
In the last two months, we spoke to the Assistant Commissioner and responded positively to the health department and other ministries to the concerns regarding première and whistleblowing.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics, such as dispatching, flexibility in training, additional training for those who returned from a professional expiry, training chests, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender-specific wages in medicine, was a sign of how serious it was for employers, health education England and the health department in respect of compliance with BMA agreements in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after the authorities have recommended to administer this more people for a longer period.
The inhibitive drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medicine has been administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NICE regulatory authority of the NHS has recommended a four-year take-up to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE regulatory authority of the NHS has recommended a four-year take-up to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fat material in the arterial walls that form plagues.
If the plague breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that hides the flow of blood to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the blood clotion dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and hide the blood flow into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.
The draft instruction of NICE, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a two-day aspirin intake for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In the absence of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with desastrous consequences."
The fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness makes election fraud bloom in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from the office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being wizardly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles obsesses the police, election observers and councils to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to "oversensitivity with regard to ethnic and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, which is now an antruption king, said that the intimidation of electors from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up absent bands outside of election cabins to protect intimidated electors.
He recommends that electors conduct a ID with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter must just call his name and address.
The report proposes that non-remote ink be placed on the finger of a person when they give their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls on the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect the community's government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture, which is involved," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the official mayor Lutfur Rahman should be disfellowshipped after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he would have put his critics to silence with Rassissmus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman should have "found his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - the older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate for their choice.
Sir Eric, illustrated, made several recommendations to purify the election system, including the conduct of IDs to prove the identity
His report says: "As evidence, pressure has been exercised on Members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistani or arbitrary background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have ignorantly ignored such behavior because of "politically correct" oversensitivity with regard to ethnic and religion."
Sir Eric expressed 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists process letter selection documents in order to stop "whole harvesting".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also demands harder registration checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing for your ID.
Use not removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she gave her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Perform systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are elevated.
A three-year limitation on requests for an automatic choice of letters.
Prohibition that political activists do complete choices and turnovers of letter elections.
The police are empowered to set up locks for election stations.
A change in law which facilitates a charge for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act (Volksvertretungsgesetz 1983).
Photographer ban in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensive training in order to ensure that the employees apply the rule that electors go into the election cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal indication was filed after the Tower Hamlet's case.
"The Election Court declared Lutfur Rahman and his alternate for corrupt and illegal practices because of a litany," he said.
It was known due to a number of reasons for sufficiently sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the unefficient "abhake controls" of the election registration departments of the Council houses.
Sir Eric said, "The judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of the parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and concealed spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy to Kate's double-course bike and other famous double-gatherers of Olympic sportsmen in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympiade in Rio this week came out of the edge and band of French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be an impressive double-course of the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic isn't the only gold-fighting athlet that has its own famous double-gatherer this summer - at least not if one can believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flimmering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain similarity with Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the US team in the bow shoot Brady Ellison, left, is compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate's double gang on the racing track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The team member of the U.S. team in the Brady Ellison archery has caused an attack on Twitter after images that he sees like Wolf of Wall Street Star appearing in secret.
In fact, the archer got the madness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I myself do not see a great similarity, except the face hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I think I'm a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus on this year: the increasing similarity between the British widespringer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with its large, expressive eyes is supposed to be able to pass through as a double gang for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimming pool Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
A move higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the inception actor
Another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-brained skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was testified by fans to be a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put in the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the likeness of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and their smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the Gabby Douglas turns, which has its own beautiful, wide smile similar to Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "like a pig died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-style swimming swimming swimming ropes CBC live transmission of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
CBC's Canadian broadcaster had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "like moisture" and during the race like "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-style swimming stock.
MacDonald, who had been taken to the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the second stage of the swimming swim at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor back, allowing the Canadians to lock up the gap to China.
Watchers across Canada reacted quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane twoth, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "how a pig died"????
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on mission."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-style swimming stock for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many spoke to him
Twitter-User didn't stop when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racist. #angeekelt.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC mission, apologized himself live for MacDonald's comment and said: "We apologize that the comment on a swimming performance has been emitted."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry that it happened."
In the end, CBC apologized for more than 90 times with the people who replied to the notices about Twitter
The commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his excuse to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We regret sincerely that these statements have been made and that it has been possible for them to be emitted.
We quickly apologized yesterday night with our spectators on mission and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to them as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the mission and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad in the CBC Olympic mission, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to them as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I'm very sorry."
Purchasers in Primark displeased with women trying underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers did not know where to look at when a woman pulled out her clothing in the middle of a primary to try underpants.
To worsen the situation, she snatched as she looked in it, pulled her out and put her back to the shelter.
She continued and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The primary store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put her back to the shelter
One mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she went back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a couple of underpants out of the layout, pulled out her own scratch pants and trousers and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a somewhat more discreet place to do it - she was just there, freaking like Oskar."
"Everybody stared when she pulled out the underpants that apparently didn't like her because she put her back into the shelter."
She repeated the same with three further underpants before she finally decided that you didn't like anything, went back and went out.
"She didn't seem to disturb it that she watched someone - or think of the person who might be buying the underpants that she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take underpants home who had another person and who were not washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I got along, the employees tried to pull the clothing out of the sale after she went - which is as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new couple of underpants and find out that another woman had her and pulled her out again and they were not washed."
A speaker of Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday, August 9 in our folkstone branch."
All the products in question were sold.
How to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the splash for your robber.
If you approach you from behind, you should turn around as the first thing, so you can see your attacker and "go out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Then take the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it in your face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee into the body and turn, while the attacker knocks up before pain, the gun out of his hands. Smoke him with the run into the face and move back as they direct the gun on him.
For attackers that approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, grab the gun and turn it, so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before they move back and direct the gun on it.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it's like Mizrachi.
But remember, it's safest for a robbery to deliver your money - if you're not a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright shoots his tongue for a guide in the dirtyest places of Europe
A British traveller undermined his immune system and wurgereflex to a serious examination by decoding some of Europe's most dirty and uglyest places.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his trains on a euro-shine, a country at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before he distracted each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will indulge.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to the day.
The idea of leaking off the dish button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally dissuasive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen rinse.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he dropped left more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.
Mr Wright was known for testing the resistance of his intestines by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public lands to railway stations to dishwashers of toilets, the task of his immune system definitively under a sample
In the movie, he said, "I was relatively unsorgeous as a child as regards my health and I put all the things I could in my mouth, earth, worms and mudwater."
In the film, he was at least justified his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample section showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
Compared to this, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to distract after their luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the bacteria number in different places like the bathroom
In the movie he says, "That's close to the worst thing I smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna touch anything here, because it's ugly in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.
The company is performing Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumer something new.
Something that is fascinating to view and simultaneously explains the benefits of Probiotics.
We carried out crazy Brainstorms that ended with saying "Let us call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestines will become a global phenomenon
Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.
The growing interest in in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film, we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added: "Let me say it so - I had lost my respect for Ian if he had laced some of the things I ordered him to leak, just like the ugly Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to attract them and others with which this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty delicious eggs on film."
In a 2015 survey carried out by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated milk acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestinal and 58 percent, it stated that they at least occasionally use products containing associated milk acid bacteria.
A social family destroyed before logging Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An a social family left her social apartment after a delogin with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked residents found property in an irrparable state.
The walls showed up clogging holes, wooden tiles were swept up, waste was scattered on the floor and Graffiti was smashed on the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment is no longer repairable.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people do not have to live in this way.
There are many things to take into account, as this property is likely to be regarded as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is infamous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added included street fights with baseball hits, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive shouting, disputes and curses.
Skeldon, 47 whose name was on the rental contract, received an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old waste was found
In the estate in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden tiles were scrapped up
Neighbors said that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly the police
Cornwall Housing delogged her and her partner this week violently from the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily.
The delogation was jubiled by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made hell.
One said, "They didn't scorn anybody."
We lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"Today, we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used!
Now where they're finally gone, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have absurd the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overcrowded side of the municipality house, waste and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant was absurd to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, since a delogge is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, since behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have been courageous and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and give the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging on the floor
Workers from the household will now have to remove wastebergs that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash amounting to £1,700.
Skeldon received a penalty after she had known the possession of a drug of class B in commercial pursuit.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.
After they were without home, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smashed with Graffiti.
The police say she will log tenants who don't keep up with the house order.
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall told us that delogging was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house order.
"This is about those who think they can handle themselves without self-approval as well as those who have been damaged by such a behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Panic tourists in Portugal after a deep-flying military jet is overlooking beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion airplane of the air forces put an incredible fall flight
Air Forces reported that it was on a training flight but persistent that there was no security risk
This was the moment when fearful tourists start to panic after a deeply flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft fled almost in a tight proximity over the sun worshipers at the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The holidayers rose up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle drives without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said, "It was two times very deep over and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me."
Tourists at the beach of Aveiro were panic when the plane came out of darkness and incredibly deeply flew
Today, the Portuguese air forces announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and to fly so deep that this was the only way to identify them.
The spokesperson said that because of the bad viewing conditions, surface fires near themselves fled slightly deeper than usual, the air forces persisted that safety was never at any time in danger.
Area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people were killed on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns about Seville
Seville - The FC Barcelona fights the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
In the Duell, the Catalans approach the Spanish Supercup to the FC Seville, the back game rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must refrain from Neymar, who competes with Brazil with the Olympic football tournament with the lower Cupfinalists and governing Europe-League champion.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
In training, the German suffered a tape disorder in the knee, with which at least the question at Barca is first clarified in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for two years with the status as a number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far abandoned a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first compulsory game of the new game, there is doubt at the Spanish master about the fitness state of the team, which was humiliated in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4 on Saturday.
At 3:2 in the sample galopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know to convince.
In turn, Seville has to digest the 2:3 deposit after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and seeks the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is with 11 successes of record winners in this application.
Ma Long in a private league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis olympiasis.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old in Rio de Janeiro defeated his countryman and "Title Defense" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4,4) in a one-sided final.
So the world rankings first brought the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes with WM, World Cup, World Tour Final Tutorial and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese have succeeded in the final game and made up the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympia trip was the former SVS-NÖ-Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the plate, between the sentences and time-outs they had no coaches with themselves.
They had withdrawn to the tribune and left their shooters in the fair competition alone.
"The Matches until here I played for my country."
"I'm playing for myself in the finale," Zhang rightly said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Afterwards he set the pace on the plate and left Zhang only 13 points.
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected match.
However, there was sufficient breathtaking ball change.
Mizutani won the game of Bronze against the 40-year-old Wladimir Samsonow 4:1.
In his quarter finale against German European champion Dimitry Ovtcharov, the White Ross had been infringed by ribs, afterwards in medical treatment, and had to "successfully" begun with sheets.
By the way, the Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympia-Vierte in similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits ′′ serious problems′′ in the election struggle
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditional conservative states, to lose their majority.
Presidency candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republican Highburg Utah.
A rare moment when the multi-millionary normally occurring in great purity and self-confidence expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After he threw 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts of his success in the struggle for the White House are now growing.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
Wrong reports about his chances, he resumed his well-known media sculpture.
Wake up Republican High-Blocations
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were equal.
Other institutes see Trump, but not with the distance used for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be risky.
In an interview by the CNBC broadcaster, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's early march: "Genauso, as I did so far."
And pushed afterwards: This will "or be successful, or I will make a very nice, long vacation".
He's doing nothing else to tell the truth.
If it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it would be fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump Party should have threatened to delete money to support his election struggle, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress are more armed.
Olympia: Trist fraud in Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's light athletes threatened after the second doping issue at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a Doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee told us to set up a disciplinary committee immediately to examine the case.
A Kenyan official had informed that the former Sprinter and Coach, John Anzrah, had delivered an urine probe in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the Doping Controllers to the team manager of Kenya.
The IAAF World Association has requested the IOC to provide information about the case in order to work on its own investigations, a IAAF speaker informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following IOC measures, IAAF will make an assessment," said an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, issued the sample and signed," said Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was owned by the accreditation of the athletes, which was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
In 2015, Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing WM-Vier.
Four days earlier, the Queen's light-athletic delegation chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio games.
He is supposed to have informed athletes of upcoming Doping tests against payments.
According to media reports, he was supposed to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping operations for a long time.
In announcement of the more than 2000 Doping target controls in front of the Rio games, it was unusually suggested that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into sight.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exercised a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks ago.
As a result, the WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping fighting is consistent with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a large runner nation.
The country's light athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports from the ARD, repeatedly accusations have been made that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last demanded a similar investigation in Kenya as he had put it in Russian light athletics.
It could be demonstrated that this type of sport was dipped surfacely and systematically.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple of love, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of Classical and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar orchestra under the direction of the Venezonal conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he warms.
We always say that she is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this stage, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She reminiscent of her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary always fascinated me.
First of all, because she is musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is wise, of course naïve, and very passionate.
"It is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as Romans," says Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's an immense generous person.
And Bartoli gives the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Digging is a necessity for him.
You see it in every movement, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is up-to-date: "In this piece it is about prejudices and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York inhabitants didn't want them.
They are the same topics, and they are just as meaningful today as they were at the time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS, reported that reports died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's boltwork in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she had planned to leave the warbounded country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war area - people can stop ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London rose to an airplane towards Turkey and then to a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that in the case of a election victory at Garland, Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader at Senat Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dead judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected from Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokesman of Reid later said that he hadn't talked to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't take care of trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Columbia District.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination were Lakaien and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was inadequate for the presidential office.
Treats wants nacktkalendar for "women and for men"
The Treats Magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to publish a 1970s Pirelli-inspired Kalendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
At the beginning of this year, Treats Steve Shaw's chief editor told us that his nackt magazine signed by Oldschool Playboys, since "Playboy is for men".
I'll do that for women.
Apparently, he believes that the Kalendar does it too.
"We have to return to the representation of timeless and classical nackness, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by these pictures of a female body," said Shaw in a press release to the release of the Calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality expects mass flight
"Who does not adapt and commends Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the Chairman of the Gülen-nahe Foundation Dialog and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "some hundred thousand", believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the hard practice of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after the attempt to shoot, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Association Chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday.
Because the government had overturned Kurdish high-burgs with criminal actions months ago, 500.000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey.
After the decayed cousin, still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that takes refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitian cities.
This is why Erdogan wanted to increase the excursion pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The Head of Association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its followers".
In Germany, too, a "hexen hunt" against Erdogan critics took place.
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will search asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionelles.
The brand marking as a gold hanger destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"Who does not adapt and commends Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and Säkulars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-nahe Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports on figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum rights recognised for political persecution in Germany.
On June 30th, this was 11.386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all asylum-authorised persons (39.625).
In this survey, those who flee from war, poverty or perspectivelessness are not found.
Asylum-authorized according to the basic law are exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Lower Saxony: "Go where it hurts"
Crazy Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election fight - and the holidayers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the day of the country.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
In 2021, the country-day election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Swedish Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
For more stupid than so far it has not been: summer holidays, heat and country-day election struggle - that bites itself.
The locals who are supposed to be convinced by the voters are on vacation.
Most holidayers who are in the country are travelling on Usedom, Rügen or Hidden Sea, are not locals, so don't choose the day of land.
These are practical problems: In the holidays, helpers hanging posters, blowing balloons, distributing flyers and choosing voices are just tiring up.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to be forced by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, just started.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear his office.
The SPD, since 1998 strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
Interestingly, how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains coalitionable at the end.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 government head of government, is making an almost unintentional election campaign, one looks away from his large posts.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and wash a little with the people, as it did his legendary wortcarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Soulring has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blooming of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "We're gonna do this" has accelerated the rise of the legal poopists, which is likely to cost him now the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidates, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make elections at the wrong time at the right place.
She has invited two chancellor Angela Merkel to a large audience; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably a majority from other federal countries," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But no one from other corners of Germany is harmful to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North East CDU is largely abandoning the usual electoral struggles in market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.
That, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that in the country you have to burn the base that it has to be very hard to find a wire to the people again.
It's like the left, the SPD, the green: hardly exist in the pastures of the country.
However, the Council of CDU election fighter Kokert to his competitors is also self-entlarving: "You must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, Golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly engaged campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just close to the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had gained clearly with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, are expected to create the jump into the country day.
They make a modern virtue from the holiday-not and largely put their election fight into the Internet.
"Online election fight," called Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electors are searching for local voters among the vacationers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curves right through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and finds it even nice.
Her impression: "Wahlurlaub in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty."
B27-Restructuring: Restaurants suffer from locking
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to mecker.
For those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at 20 a.m., there is praise for all the time.
"They have made everything pretty rough," Elvira Tetzlaff tells of the jet tanker.
That's a super team.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be planned to south at the beginning of the week to the mid-term, until the end of October everything is supposed to be done.
It is also commended to meet those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of helping trips.
Since the construction site has been migrated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and thereby the connection to Rottenburg has been re-established.
Citizens are now able to return to two sides from Ofterdingen from the B 27.
The retirement traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were partially significant complaints," says Florian King, Deputy Head of Office responsible for the traffic management of the rehabilitation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sliding trails were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than with the shaving.
What led to some trucks burning in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality strongly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were considerable exaggerations," says King, who once made himself know about the situation on the spot.
There have been blitzing two to three per minute.
The fastest was travelling with 77 kilometres per hour in the tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has passed, it has been calmer.
For businessmen at the B 27, it is only a little comfort that the road is now open to customers from Rottenburg.
You don't like businessmen to look into the cards.
But that the B 27-saving has led to turnover breaks, let anyone who is asking through.
However, some are more affected and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customers", i.e. produced for other companies, has little consequences for the renovation.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline", but also admits that of course "manufacturing is missing".
The most turbulent are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
That's already a threat to exist.
Not only him, but all the restaurants hit it "heartedly".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The revenue losses are "wide over 50 percent".
==References====External links==
He had to leave half of his staff.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, Mr President Jörg Schmidt, on a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, answered with the indication that the restaurant otherwise benefited from the benefits of the situation in the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation.
Göhner knows from other districts, where such a generous handling was done.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his guesthouse will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
The fact that other tribal guests are now less frequent overlooking because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.
If you can't drive, it's nice elsewhere.
The fact that his family clients return after the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and Bird Grippe, Göhner considers the effects of B 27 building work on his customership for the biggest crisis that has experienced his restaurant in its long-standing history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal already.
In the name of terrorism, it is constantly screwed into laws.
After the recent attacks, interior minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does a toxic status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliator.
All of his proposals are "politically acceptable to the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package.
They're not presuming anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also engaged in it.
However, as an internal minister, he was located on results and on a "realistic consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has passed a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, plagued: that a new security authority should take care of the knocking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU standards on air passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, the Maizière launches a second start for proposals that had not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to put a sympathetic heritage for terrorist groups under punishment and dismiss jihadists with double citizenship the German passport.
"That will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still thinks that this is conducive and does not demand anything that has no chances at the coalition partner at all.
A few new ideas also present the Maizière.
They partly have it in themselves: he plans fast procedures for deportation and more opportunities to imprison people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically taken to the country are intended to check their smartphones before and to disclose social media accounts for a security review.
He wants to make some even worse in tolerances for refused asylum seekers than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers to hide their identity.
Some of these are political and legally delicate.
Some things are still unextended and open up questions.
And in some points - for example in the unequal treatment of patients - the question is: What really has this to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to distinguish between the subjects of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be asserted that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that were deeply busy by the people could not be cut off in election times.
The inner security is enormously concentrated.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly emerging on the matter of internal security.
In the past days, between the two parties, there has been a high level.
First, a fine dispute about the facilities of the Federal Police, then about a security-policy collection of some Union ministers in which the heads of reside also demand a Burka ban and a departure from the double citizenship.
The Maizière is also trying to make reconciling sounds.
He doesn't keep anything from a double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
It's not meaningful to reopen it.
And in the case of a Burka ban he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "acceptable" for the coalition partner, it needs to be shown.
There's a few things in it that could make a fight.
However, the SPD is also trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Partial chief Sigmar Gabriel signals cautious willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is willing to talk about everything that helps to increase security."
People's cars are still glamorous.
Despite diesel candals, delivery numbers worldwide rise.
But it is not all in the markets.
In the callback action, there is a term for a wire.
Volkswagen starts in the extraditions more behavioral in the second half of the year.
Although Europe's largest car builder can continue to show a plus in the previous year, despite the diesel affairs, thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
However, in July the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and again stressed the overall sale, as the company notified in Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1,8 percent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany's home market, the deliveries rose by almost one sixth.
Trademark manager Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker numbers from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, "changed economic conditions" have been a reduction in purchases.
In addition to the situation around the coupling attempt in Turkey, a spokesman explained that the British vote would be burdened on the withdrawal of the EU.
In the United States, where the gas affairs first escalated, there is also a little more to book.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mostly affected domestic trademark of Lower Saxony continues to be glimpsed by the Dieselcandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition minus is available from 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler could continue to present a salesplus from January to July.
1.3 percent more cars delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software gas test.
In Germany alone VW calls about 2.5 million cars to re-equipp the workshops.
In the course of the rearrangement, VW confirmed that the transformation of the cars has no negative effects.
After the transformation of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power.
The car builder shall issue a "guarantee-equal" certificate to the customer after the relocation, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was said in business circles on Friday.
Reason are legal feasibility.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a warranty for re-equipped diesel models.
This would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
This meeting was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport.
"VW has to fully meet the requirements of my Investigation Commission and the KBA."
"Deviations from these are not accepted," said Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration occurs in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after relocation and that all type-approval-relevant vehicle values are unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was mentioned in business circles.
In the broad term "Garanty", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop for half a year after the reconstruction, for example with a motor damage - and this could lead back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It should also be important in customer interest to avoid any other damages that have nothing to do with the gas scandal, as it was said, in the event of any possible guarantee schemes.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savings - as the second institute in Germany - to be penalties.
Bank chief Joseph Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or day-to-day accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it: normal savings would "not have to be afraid to pay for their Spargish penalty."
Banks have to store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay 0.4% of their penalty.
This fee requires the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards from private and corporate customers for deposits over EUR 100.000 to Giro or Day Money Accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He has been watching 40 million euros, which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which it could not use.
"They are on the central bank account with me and cause 0.4% costs," said the bank chief.
"I can't put 4000 euros for every million."
The costs will now be continued according to the polluter principle.
The cash just to lie in the Tresors of the Raiffeisenbank would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four attacks, I don't want the fifth!" said the bank board.
Most customers would have understanding and switched to other plant forms.
Only few wandered to other banks.
The Bavarian Association of Cooperatives stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks."
It is not possible to carry them on its own "business-economically lasting".
Some German banks therefore increased their charges for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
With penalties for deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made headlines with its Skatbank-Filial 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Business Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay covering charges for deposits, so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong."
One banker said there's "a client that's a bit more well equipped with the property" at the Tegernsee.
"That can be a problem for a small bank," if she keeps money free of charge.
Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Bavarian Association of Cooperatives "is currently not known any other banks which calculate a deposit compensation for private customers," said Sprecher Ernst.
The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had explained at the end of June: "The threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is hard, and it threatens the immigration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not be able to like this in the width.
Destination Plates: Who actually buys sound plates?
Single men in the middle age love plates.
Before you hurry to the comment part to oversee it under the pseudonym NotAllSingleMenMittlerenAlters with raw insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the widespread recovery of sound plates is not due to a tree in Millennials that wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are all foreseen at the age of 45 to 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog would be a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a business street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and steal wildly before I stay, hold my hands, and say something decisive like: "So let us take a closer look at it."
Well, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic record special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to disable the camera for the next part in which I stand close to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men medium-aged) into Reckless Records (data count: eight men medium-aged, probably a woman around 20) is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I'm asking?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), clothe the walls of his living room.
The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and pleaded.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60's, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I probably was a little too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and like to spend alone time, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my slander.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meet him will meet the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hip, people who have heard about the comeback and who have seen themselves to buy their old plates again.
Of the conversations I have conducted, people usually have completed their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the tree to followers of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that plate shops offer a soothing community of equality.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took an impact on the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted plate shells, of objects that awaken happy youth reminders.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's like this as a collector and I think it's so with many people.
It is a simple way to focus on spiritual matters.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff flew from a stack.
A ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month haven't heard them yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, as I leave through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three men medium ages), has noticed a "tropheen aspect" of the revival.
"Soon someone came in here here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound plate so that I can put it into the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it happens definitely.
More product-lasting, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who are slowly coming in.
Fopp, who devoted almost a whole floor to the sound plates, has a bubble audience when I went in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage and women middle age.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts' newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drowns from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity with the customers.
None of them look strangely lonely, but nighting psychic traumas are difficult to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and considers the holiday of the records for sale.
She's making a window bumper rather than a big shopping.
She doesn't deserve much, so the collection of records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is..." It drives off with a loved sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to suppress the Jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter overlook to buy a Crosley plate player.
To the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just decorative, some are so far upstairs that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plat art".
But in view of the fact that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is no surprise that one population has more time and money than another is also the one who spends most for luxury items like plates.
Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov vote, at least in record shops in Soho, they leave the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, plate shops and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday tomorrow with the bumping through plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plate, while avoiding the starving view of an unfair 30-year-old false moderator that rises over the shoulders of nothing unfamiliar men of the middle age.
The Grönlandhai is the longest living turtle - video report
Scientificly, the Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all turbulent animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examines the shark, says that the record was at a female from which it is expected that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court refuses to offer the cancellation of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais, to break down tens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court proceedings this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be authorized to break down 72 provisional transactions in which persons within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdryer services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or sell simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Calais' prefecture argued that these places should be crushed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would hold a fire and sanity risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, since the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also concluded that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses but admitted that the concerns of Calai's prefecture were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the food shops, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feeding people who are "in extreme precarious conditions".
He said that the areas offer calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the Lower Rise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is non-profitable and offers 200 meals on the day, English and French classes asylum and advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unguided minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian it said that the closure "for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of those living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arrivals in the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympics, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be undermined.
"I continue to keep the World Cup in mind, remain confident and fighting," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He hasn't got a statement for his thirty-fiveth place on the sugar hat.
"I really find it difficult to comment on the time driving from yesterday," said Martin.
He had to analyse the reasons for the debakel alone.
In October, Martin wanted to fight for the title at the time-run-WM in Qatar.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in recent times."
"I also have my position," wrote the three-time champion of the world, who had lost more than three minutes on Olympia Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday at 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis profi Siegemund missed semifinale
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in Rio's quarter final: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semifinal of the Olympic tennis tournament.
She was assembled by back problems only once and was forceless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday the medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) had the chance of jumping into the front round.
The Australian Open winner met with the British Johanna Konta (nr. 10).
Tommy Haas had taken a medal in Sydney in 2000 as the last German tennis professional.
Two German DTB launchers in the quarter final of summer games had last been present in 1992.
There was never a German duo in an Olympic single halffinale.
Group increases when starting up for live video game transfers
Watching other people in playing video games is a giant trend - Microsoft wants to benefit from it too.
The technology group buys the start-up beam specialized in this hobby.
How much money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and already has more than 100.000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but you can also intervene.
For example, they can give up missions to players and face enemies and provide equipment.
The Playing Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of the e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is to help.
The advertising industry is already obedient.
The staff of the start-up, which has its seat so far in Seattle in the US state of Washington, move to the Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam founders and Chief Matt Salsamendi reported.
For customers, therefore, no change should be made by the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The live streaming market of videoplay activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by the online dealer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's razor must be adjusted to the next generation of speed measurements: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are tested which are particularly effective to transpose tempos sins.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailers of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at accidental highlights, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway buildings or to rehabilitation bridges with temporary tempo limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or experiencing.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across several traces.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, drives and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-driven state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply claused, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the panced and, by the way, also safe outside shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic's information in various federal countries and has now been used.
Also foreign authorities flash with the new technology: Jüngst has ordered 100 pieces, after a order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain collects silver in the 7-rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets Gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-rugby came to an abrupt stop on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten in the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio with a result of 43-7.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, reverse, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympia medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad comfort of the silver medal - the fourth of the UK on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have beat a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbleddon.
GB had a difficult way behind him.
She lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan eight years ago.
There she just lost one.
This loop is wounded, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and made the attacks of GBs out of spass.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running in driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau elevated in the corner.
With four more minutes of playtime, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he transformed.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
A magnificent tackle from Mitchell stopped the Mount of Mann Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reap and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stirred up to the line to make a gate.
The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the same thing.
GB made fundamental changes to the mid-term and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Homeova passed through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had been in favour of the Southern Seainsulans, whose fans were singing, swinging flags and dancing on the tribune.
It was not difficult to admire the gambling approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-dip with another attempt in the last seconds.
The pepper embraced the Fijis and GB kicked devastatingly in the lawn.
Previously on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinale with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a scarce half-final match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and achieved a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the coach's cancer to ruder victory
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that wants something to be called.
From the first rower to the last, 220 hard hieves who enter the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who sat on the row, there were three votes in the boat. The echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they rested the second Olympiagold in the Twoer without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, nevertheless her 39.th unpleasant use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of tails, which does not reflect the type of triumph to gans.
Behind every gold in the row is a Bataillon of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago whether he would survive that day when cancer was diagnosed with him.
He said he was risky.
I had bubble cancer that is operating and they did.
If you don't, he's spreading out everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a little changing the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he could start his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption at a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rudering itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even larger one.
In the immediacy of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking something more than otherwise, trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was head of the Royal Artillery regiment in an action in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me how much Helen and I worked and Robin too.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so we're going to thank him a lot. He's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not hold.
Even in the last 500 meters when the New Zealand and Denmark teams started to join, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "Keep up in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we were not trying to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take an expiry for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, their own with the TV adventur Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to understand that I was an olympiationian.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitenstein Group", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is considered to be "bayern wide-ranging".
A small drinking water association as an example for the large water producers.
This was a time ago in the original tone in a contribution of the Bavarian radio.
A little later, the water forum of the government of underfranken honored the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group was "bayernweit as an example".
Behind all that, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the purpose of employee, is 28 years as Managing Director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitenstein Group with its seat in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water each year and provides 32 places and Weiler with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current Chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was appointed Managing Director of the Target Association in 1985.
"His tasks have been very diverse and ranged from the water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," said the Chairman.
As outstanding events, it called the commissioning and dedication of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high containers (1999), the rebuilding of a central computer control (2004) and the sub-renovation of water pipes.
There has not been any halt, and you have repeatedly taken up innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.
He used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group to reduce nitrate in front of the Water Forum of the District Subfranken.
He received a great deal of recognition and praise for that.
Rupert Göller, on his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterguard and he was a faithful boy.
Together we were an invaluable team.
As highlights from his point of view, he described the building of the fountain and the restructure of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the breach of pipe at the high container at Kirchlauter on a 3rd January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees the whole night will have to work through so that the villages could be provided with water.
Also, the supply of Neubrunn could only be preserved because the high containers of Pettstadt were filled with sludges.
The management of the Drinking Water Confederation was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who arrives in the succession of Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open to the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
The eight-year-old Tiago, however, had come forward well and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that is back for two years when I sang on the Mailänder Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to the bass bariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship in Bargenheide - Man shoots on lifemate
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargenheide (Kreis Stormarn) and killed her.
"The man himself called with us and indicated that he shot his lifemate," said a police speaker.
The perpetrator shall be fled, and after him shall be offended publicly.
In the meantime, Sven S. could travel by car.
The man is about 1,80 meters large, muscular, brown brown and has a sleeve.
Now the police have published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man wears a sleeve.
The man shouldn't be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, the police said.
Whoever sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110.
The police speak of a "relation state".
The victim was the year 1988, the killer 1981.
At first, the police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about tathergang or the relationship between offenders and victims; but it confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a killing thing."
"We don't say more," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special commission (SEK) was at the crime site.
Steel - Lighting for German steel industry
The crystal-built and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional cost in millions.
Financial burdens threatened by the industry from eco-flow funding are from the table.
It remains in the liberation of the renewable energy environment in the so-called own electricity production plants in the German steel industry, said Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission, therefore, had first planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the high furnace for electricity production for their own consumption.
The steel industry threatened additional costs of EUR 120 to 240 million per year, according to the German industry association.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with the Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants, a EEC envelope of 20 percent falls.
But they are not raised in the steel industry too.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of own electricity.
Thus, the status Quo of the previous regulation is largely defined.
The success of Gabriel's efforts for the steel industry is particularly important.
"In view of our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"More have to follow."
"Even in the reform of emission rights trading, climate and employment targets are assessed," IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt explained.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation was further intensified when the world's largest producer country in China was thrown massively on the world market due to the weakening domestic demand of steel.
European manufacturers are proposing price dumping from Chinese steel companies.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties on import steel show effect, on the other, the economic prospects in China have illuminated.
Unclear is how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prize Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Lastly, the prices would have been more stagnant.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, about 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July the German steel manufacturers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced more than six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Association announced steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now decreased the second month after each other.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been by two percent below the previous year.
In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing outturn.
Community, Spirit, Health: Sing Seniors Good
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: As a young girl she was in the school chor, in the teaching office she spent the specialist music, and today the 78-year-old singing in an elderly choir.
"Sing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful and altogether living, she says.
In addition, she does something good to her health and her spirit.
For singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with the likes, Hackler describes.
Through regular association, seniors can link and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures at age are resolved, then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Take and organize yourself, rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of gathering."
Singing can be effortful in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the pist in everyday life.
Even if it is about to maintain the sound of the voice in the age, singing is an optimal hobby.
For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of the Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or hearing songs awakens many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, people who are self-infected are of long-relapsed events.
In singing, the head is also demanded a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a specified rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that you learn through singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-evaluation also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I do a long time for something, I get better and wake beyond me - strengthen this experience.
So there is enough good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent, Lenz recommends.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes right there?
At the search for the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the acquaintance sings in an old-age chor, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the chores in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader.
Many senior chores can also be found on the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet research.
Anyone who likes to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.
Sing the soul does well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats respond more sensitive than cater to cries of young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the Miauen also did not cold the males, but they always acted equally in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the excitement of cat babies at the Miauen of the Little.
They react by ten percent faster to sounds of kätzchen, which are in great need, as scientists from the veterinary university and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have discovered.
Kater also responds to the calls of kittens - but always equal.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the miauen of less and strongly excited young animals are either unobservable or not of significance for the males," said Biologian Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study that was published this Friday in the BMC Evolutionary Biology magazine.
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and tone height of the chicken scream differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult caters and eight cats from the animal keeping of the MHH were observed.
They were played for one call by young ones who were taken from the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and sisters.
On the other hand, they were confronted with crying by more excited kittens that were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even those who had no childhood yet, responded differentiated to the cry," said Konerding.
They turned faster to speaker when these calls played the very excited chests.
This ability may be born or developed with gender maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already studied several times in humans the reactions of women and men to baby noises.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitive to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski takes "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football lie in Turkey.
In Turkey a warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coupling attempt, an important football game takes place again in Turkey.
Before the duell of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly stated: "Business as usual".
In the event of the suspension of the exceptional state after the reversal attempt in July, the government regulated that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the attempt to coat.
This does not stop before the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the prosecutor issued a detention warrant.
Accordingly, it is prescribed to be a member of a terrorist group that is now living in America.
Sükür is intended to be an adherent to the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the attempt by the president of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the initial condition for 90 days still applies until October, it actually has as good as no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democratic growth" on public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan for the end on Wednesday.
The sports are divided into adherents and opponents of Erdogan, like the whole country.
Particularly fans of Besikta's Worker Club are not traditionally one of the president's friends.
But what is the greatness of the Turks in view of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military cracks.
There are even the fans themselves agreeing - no matter whether their heart beats Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With Pokalsieger "Gala", it will come back to Luke Podolski.
The Cologne's sporty value proved in the past season: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first game time as the top scorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he won the 1:0 winner.
The newspaper "Famatic" exclaimed him: "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record champion has found a reconciling conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also expelled early in the Europe League.
In the Süper Lig, it was only in rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The pokal was the only way to win something.
"We did this and this is the most important," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the base for the 14th title with 26 season hits as a Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
That is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
At the same time, Gómez, who was awarded to Besiktas only after the attempt to attempt to return to the country's political situation after its EM-urlaub.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman.
However, the storms would have to be willing to abandon about a third of its estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman stated: "We cannot pay a salary of Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice for Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other light-athletic sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The theme Doping continues to determine the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who, after a Doping Sperre, had succumbed her right to start shortly before the games, was poured out mercilessly at her start (100 meters of chest).
There was a scurrile scenery: with an upset smile, she was still proud of the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was found that she wouldn't get gold, the audience broke out into a jubelstorm.
However, there are still many other athletes who start at the Olympic Games in Rio despite Doping.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He was already locked two times for Dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the Olympiager of 2004 and the ex-world champion has been running even faster than before, it is over 100 metres in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the largest publisher of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaica): The two-time olympiasieger and seven-fold world champion had to sit a six-month lock after she was proven to take Oxycodon.
After surgery she had severe tooth pain, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the olemymine from 2012, world champion of 2013 and European champion of 2010 to 2016 was positively tested for the forbidden Stimulans Mittel Methylhexanamin.
Perkovic contends with the knowledgeal intake and was locked six months.
The four most wide-ranging swords this year go to the account of the great gold favoritine.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel/USA): The Beijing Olympiager and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been positively tested in 2010 and had been locked 21 months.
A means of penis magnification had been responsible, controlled Merritt.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 metres of the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerworf, Belarus): hardly an athlete has been recognized so many medals afterwards.
In 2005, Tichon lost his WM title nine years later, after being identified with him Testosteron Doping.
The 40-year-old also had to release Olympia Silver 2004 due to steroid dopings and EM title 2006 for testosterone abuse.
The bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games, however, was resigned to him on the basis of a judgment of the International Sports Court of CAS.
At 80,04 metres, he is on rank two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world recorder and goldfavoritin were tested positively until May, but can still start in Rio.
During the 29-year-old world champion was found indications of the intake of a banned food supplement, the blocking of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mild and ran off on July 13th.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian message in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday early.
She suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but she could have left it again.
Her home trip was planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens are still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stands in constant contact with the local authorities, according to Schnöll.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, was first exploded on Thursday evening in an excavated quarter of two bombs.
According to police, a Thai countryman had been killed and some 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday early, then, two explosions went up again, and another person was killed, according to the authorities.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the early days.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the Badstrands Patong, popular with vacationers.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a city employee.
According to the authorities, in a flower beet before the coastal police district, the exploration rate had gone to the air.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injuries.
It was said to be from a link with the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombattatts bear the same manuscript," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday early before journalists.
"We assume it's a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives, but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the Muslim separatists in the southern part of the country in the attacks.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist rebellion movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Instead, one assumes that the bombs were laid by opposers of the ruling military junta.
In the past days, the authorities had received secretary indications on upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but they had not been informed about the exact time and the places.
Be unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bomb attacks in Thailand, but they usually do not direct themselves against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej for years.
According to the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) was valid for the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim parts of the population, unnecessary travels to these provinces will be advised.
Increased security risk (Security level 2) was valid for the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This also gives great influence to the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and Prime Minister Prayer Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody turmoil, has benefited himself to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, it has not been possible for the military to control the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme southern part of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a attack on a popular Hindu bail - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "Idential Movement" has been consulted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the Constitutional Protectors in the Confederation have also observed the group.
"We see in the 'Identitary Movement' points for striving against the freedom of democratic constitution," said Constitutional Protection Chief Hans-Georg Maaßen der Deutschen Presseagentur in Berlin.
Thus, migrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being diffamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement.
The "Identitary Movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multikulti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of your own identity by alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identitarians".
Maaßen said that his authority voted closely with the national offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Idential Movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Constitutional Protection Chief.
Generally, extremists try to address them with a young language, often with poppy music.
This is the case with Islamists as well as legal extremists.
This isn't a stunning advertisement for your own thing.
Propaganda is supposed to touch people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there have been reports from several federal countries about contacts of the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no insights about this.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - is changing its goal by certain people who are extremist, and becomes so extremist.
So it is crucial whether such persons have controlling influence on the party.
This couldn't be seen.
With a view to the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodations, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But in recent years, we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freetal Group.
It may well be that other legal terrorist groups or microgroups are forming attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other legal extremist motives.
However, a German or European-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups have been created at the regional level or in social networks.
There was anxiety about the fact that many attacks took place on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying.
Many of the suspects of action in attacks on asylum accommodations were not previously known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or adherents of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing to hate before with legal extremists, perhaps politically indifferent or, for example, chose CDU, SPD or Left, which then radialised by a legal extremist mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internethit
Not always the Olympics or World Records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimming pool from Ethiopia swimed so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks Habte became the viral internet heat.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his precursor with a back of 48 seconds and laid the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not really sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special right to start from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more known in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
In reference to a "wellstandsbauch" the English boulevard sheet "The Sun" was funny with "Dad Bod".
His time, he hit only one minute and almost five seconds over 100 meters of free style, played no role.
Compared with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani provided medial attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the Swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to arrive alone in a run of over 100 meters of free style.
Frenetic was fired by Moussambani at that time.
The 22-year-old then learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never finished such a long distance before the competition.

An open industrial loft in DTLA receives a cozy makeover
We celebrate the 90th birthday of the Central Library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book
Geretsried - The owner of a shop at the New Place has been polluted.
According to the police, the 67-year-old spokesman had left her business on Monday at 17.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the casse.
Spurs of the perpetrator could not be found.
Video monitoring is not available too.
Trump sees the threatening defeat of elections not so tight
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a election campaign in Florida.
If the U.S. president chooses to be nothing, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going to travel on the holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential elections in November, it would be relatively unnecessary to him: "In the end it will either be blown, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the candidate of the Republicans in a telephone interview with the US TV CNBC.
If it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it would be fine, said Trump.
He described the U.S. President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats Hillary Clinton as the founder of the terrorist military Islamic state (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance has been formed.
Post increases in the trade with electro-transporters
An electrical device of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is apparently great.
The post plans to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
In a short time, the group wants to start trade with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters from the next year on the free car market.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been examining for months whether it is to sell to other companies to their own self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered.
Postal board Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are repeated demands, for example by craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel" the Bonner Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-owned factory, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and to make a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the complete fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK leadership shall be deducted after disappointing business payments
The consumer research company GfK exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK pointed out that the chair of director Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more unsafe, the longer the successes he promised.
Turbulenzen at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business numbers and the withdrawal of the management of the company, the worldwide number Five of the industry stands before a personal new start.
GfK Executive Chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Arno Mahlert Supervisory Board of the GfK has already been excluded from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, informed the company.
He is officially supposed to take over the function of a "chiefspeaker" until a successor for Hartmann was found.
As a reason for the resignation, the company called "different views" for long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not mean a company speaker on Friday.
Anyone who will lead the market research company is still unclear at the moment.
In investor circles, on Friday, it was said that the shareholders had recently been disappointed about the continued successes of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK peak since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet seen after 5 years," it said.
In view of the last bad GfK jobs, every shareholder will be calm at some point.
"If that was the case with BMW, the quandts would do that," it said.
After returning in the pre-quartals, the company had not been able to stop its loss trip in the second quarter of 2016.
With 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With regard to the first half of the year, sales decreased by EUR 721.2 million by 3.4 percent.
The profit in the second quarter has particularly reduced the value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company's value depreciation of 139 million euros in the Consumer Experience business sector gave the Group a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had generated a Group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slids in Crummhorn in Graves: Eight Injured
In the event of an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhorn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the prisoners suffered serious injuries, the police informed.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travelling company from Eisenach had to avoid the information of a returning truck who was partly travelling on the counterway.
The bus came right from the street and slipped into a tomb, as a spokesman of the police Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"On the basis of the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The firearm freed the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a note doctor came to the accident site on the Landesstraße 2.
The unlasted travelers were brought back from a line bus to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they were to wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the trucker and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The charges per cubic metre of wastewater are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Worldskahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euros; for Zultenberg/Lendenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euros (up to 2.26 Euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euros (up to 2.18 Euros).
In the case of the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an overlapping calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported that when the budget was approved by the Landratamt Kulmbach, it was found that these wastewater plants were undercover.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plant cost-effectively on legal basis.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens and industrial and commercial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take deeper into the pocket.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As management director Herbert Schmidt noted to the Gremium, a recalculation of fees was necessary for the wastewater facilities of the market community.
During the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers should also be compensated from the previous calculation period.
The heavy charge increases founded Schmidt that it was relatively small facilities in all three wastewater systems with a very low wastewater attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a major impact.
In addition, wastewater rises in all three plants are slightly lower.
In addition, in all three plants, there was a significant increase in rehabilitation and repair expenses during the last period of calculation.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged in the wastewater plant Azendorf due to damage.
In the Pumpwerk Welschenkahl, the almost 20-year-old funding facilities had to be occupied from the ground, and at the Lopp pond clearance plant, after nearly 20 years of operation had to be drilled out the first curtain, the sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility was built to meet the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses, the continued cost of care and maintenance was to be taken into account accordingly during the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly lower than the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low waste water attack in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "slap through full".
At the same time, Schmidt added that the market community had been spared of large entertainment costs in the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for those plants, according to Steinhäuser, will continue to remain precarious, since it is not possible to extend the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater association for these plants because it is deficitary facilities.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
The average annual inflation for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcohol beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.1%); different goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained in the past month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticizes as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that is already bound by the absurd.
You can turn into an ananas, a dog or a figure that might be of a Roy Lightenstein painting.
The filters are unblemished, proprietary tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All misunderstandings come to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past, in which they were accused that the App Blackface would support or promote white skin as beautysideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them glimpses, false teeth, and open cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "GelbFace".
They wondered whether these repeated controversy pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.
The news and the embellishment were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat told that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: The filter was designed as a homage of anime caracters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced Rassissmus reminded the filter of injurious clichés.
Others decisively refused the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose Tweet was widely distributed on the photos, wrote that the filter "was injurious and gentle."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the opposite transition of a very dislike Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow view has been drawn into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration campaign, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - which are more variety of things than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is insulting for a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account, calling on others to do the same.
In a record for media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in setting practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the large part of the white, only male leadership and finished their record with a hate day: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workplace, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what they say about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat mostly unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but, according to one speaker, the company recently terminated a personnel responsible focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, on her part, that she would have her snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this isn't O.K.."
Military management of malicious ISIS secret service information, sets the Committee of the Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command changed postal service information in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria when it would have allowed actual conditions on site, a Congress Inquiry Committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, produced by a task force of the Republican members of the Force Committee, Secret Service Committee and the Wehrbudgetcommittee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service Analysts, who reported how supervisors changed their assessment of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Message service information, which was typically dispatched by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly characterized a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed actual conditions on site and were more steadily positive than analyses of other news services," said a newspaper article.
"What has happened at Centcom is inacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the Representative House.
The executive errors in Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows constant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government heads under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows, as analysts saw themselves exposed to the pressure of their pregesetzes, to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Where the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the congress were far more positive than the facts corresponded," the report noted.
For example, a centcom relative publicly announced that a military reconvenience of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress Deputy from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the heads of the Central Command changed the reporting services to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans brought the Task Force to life after they were played that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigations.
In addition, further investigations of Centcom reports by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence are taking place.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own insights on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of postal assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff Representative House.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, " delayed the publication of postal reports," damaged morality among analysts and "gave too little room for deviating opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said not to have found any indications on the intervention of the White House at the Centcom Analysts regarding a "determined political opinion".
The preliminary results of the surveys of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the General Inspector of the Pentagon, which were recorded after complaints by Centcom Analysten.
Mr Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress while the investigations of the General Inspector were still in progress.
But he also stated that "Experten sometimes have quite different opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have reciprocal effects on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state reminds of doubts from more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, foresaw only a small crew force in Iraq and used a little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic state.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government authorities, notes that, contrary to the statements of the government, air strikes against the refinery held by the Islamic State, no significant impact would have on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refiners had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, reports the Times in September.
Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislative for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Britain stands before
One day after she shot three gates over Japan during a 6-1 victory, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember having ever done that.
"I don't know." She said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their gates in memory.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic contest and are at the same time in their group with the British in the first place, which, after their 2-0 victory against Japan, remains unslaught.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two in their group of six teams will gain the first and second place each.
The first-placed one will leave the strong Dutch women a little longer in the way the other group leads.
Whatever the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising spine through their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time at three years, and had a hockey hit in her hands (their two older sisters played sport at the Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became national player of the US, the youngest in the story of the team.
She missed the Olympiad in 2008, as she could not qualify for the framework.
Then the year 2012, when everything was wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, became a English trainer of the National Team, and it began to turn things to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We've been able to screw the rower around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lumped the ball into the gate to provide the Americans with a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of all the tournament for the U.S. gatekeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolin
Wherever you are, as late it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are constant and inevitable, a raging season between competition and pursuits.
It is as if the Olympic Fackel itself would be a burning rod that will be reached from the arm breast protector to the swimmer to the Triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the caffe shop while talking to the watch, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, for the first time in the Olympic Games and is a women's swarm with grinds, could have been among those well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-fair TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, tournament or even feather.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Trampolin Towers.
The Olympic Flame does not illuminate every event.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, arch shooting, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the chest swim and may be long.
But if I have to make modestly arguments for my particular favorite, then let me focus on the discreet charm of trampolin.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been observed in the past 16 years so peculiar that many who had asked me did not know that it was a Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorant.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete that has done it until the end of 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampolin jumping has a certain outer purse, partly because it sounds more suitable for the uninformed ear for a clowns school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an enthusiastic enthusiasm.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoony clay of his never to end the wild riot - but also the Grazie of the turning and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "spring board."
Uprising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shooting almost 30 feet into the air and have to have a number of falling movements (drives, lifts and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic Programme after execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Two-third athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will attack each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straightforward.
Medaillen hopers must continue in their pursuit to gold, faster, upward and overward, sometimes up to the destination, sometimes back, upward and down on the playground.
They pursue not only the target line or the starting wall, but also another humble goal in the television transmission: that of the world or the Olympic Record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to touch even a spectator to tears.
But it's also what I feel tired when viewing these games.
The trampoline offers an atempause.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is upstairs.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she shakes off, seemingly difficult like an astronaut, go upwards, then downwards, then effortlessly upwards.
Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant withdrawal of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.
The qualifications and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 East Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00 p.m.
NBC will radiate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general.
If the consciousness can only be achieved by the angaps and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US tournaments suggested in the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fishing emene to air.
"One generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an allies of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants demanding political changes in Ethiopia found violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that thirty protesters were killed during the collisions with the police in shooting.
Is Ethiopia just breaking up?
In the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid allies of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in the last few months protests against the government have shattered the country and spread into more and more territories.
Last week, thousands of people crashed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s answer was unbarmhering.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed on thirty unarmed demonstrators.
Videos about the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year show how securitymen beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.
The Head of the UN Human Rights Authority now calls for an in-depth investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populating country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new pendulum train in Addis Ababa capital.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was nothing but an example of democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led to the opposition by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents have been effectively put to silence.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed, or driven into the pastures of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of the ground to the slogan in terms of power of the governing coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Front of Liberation of the Ogade, which has been more or less forced in recent years, may benefit from turbulences and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of precipitation under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and Internet services improved.
Even if the government spares access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet-proxies that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopians announced that they gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest Ethnia in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the ages, the Amharas, who come from mostly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that's what's going on.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which represent about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was a 17-year-old minister of Ethiopia until his death in an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly decorated in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special representatives to handle opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime is missing from this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively ambiguous reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a rebellion was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which seemed to be spoiled by the government and then stolen according to analytics.
During the following races, many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the past months and this time of turmoil went relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new coupling, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal guilt of the Ethiopian government.
And she accepts a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked shops conducted by Tigray, and the hatred of the tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though she recently informed that it closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to break together in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin migration."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy around his campaign on Friday by saying that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been seriously meant by the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republicans' presidency candidates to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his competitors who strive to protect him during an eventual phase into the ordinary position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the protest at a election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump ruded back on Thursday's claim and in interviews stated that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously.
When Conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is falling down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already introduced Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he made strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course, I mean this sarcastic".
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to the need.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, where appropriate, "cleaning" depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.
Instead of declining the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has accepted an even more estimating tone as its survey values have continued to decrease.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with great advantage in the state of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provoked statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is more focused on the attention of his presidential campaign in the last few months, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal competitors into the uncomfortable situation to have to stand to him, regardless of how provoked his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, and one of Trump's most prominent predecessors, made great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," Mr. Giuliani said, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back bankers, completely false and therefore it happened because he departed the troops from Iraq.
Most Mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to control the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and suggested that they drove around each of his words and be prejudiced against him.
He pronounced the "poor, sad" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't do it!".
Some of the Democrats spotted about Mr. Trump's excuse as just another evidence that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Once the price is drifted from the market, Café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a delicate cafe in Williamsburg, where one could only pay bar that had no Wi-Fi but served for 15 years good coffee.
Of course, the prices from its Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were threatened.
The shop Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Indigenous, it was the last loss in a city that is becoming gentrifying.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded, and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, it's also new.
A revised verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working with verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to make money for a new outer place, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnifications such as caps and saused onions.
There are natural rides.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old tribal customers.
"Many old customers were also threatened by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly attended the verb.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.
"I became aware that it was at coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea, which is another new addition, instead of her usual Iced Coffee.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before the work and always ordered the same.
"I came quarters after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they were preparing my everything bay with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he turns off his everything basin with bail, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he did not feel angry about the fact that the souvenir business took the old business.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verbs with the cold-breaked coffee of the cafes as an ingredient.
"I think we'll still go into their offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants have also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the menu into the Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to display them soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has further advantages.
A local juice site wants to fill and sell the cold-breaked coffee into the bottles.
There is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was tribal and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that the entering of the locality and ordering felt a new coffee like a home return.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt had a feasibility for refined delicates of the Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was slightly more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato pours and as a dessert a plumber pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes last book "Chop Suey" dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brickman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a home at Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday in Harper publishing, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato pairs and vegetable mixtures ate.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
"Real foods were very popular," said Brickman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and beans bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as a dinner.
Coe grind.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was a All-You-Can-Eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways with which the country was dealing with no longer the Schlaraffenland.
"It was a time when food became a central, excited topic for the Americans," agreed Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as excited: mysterious foods such as bread and cassette rolls were used to use basic foods, which were "wonderful food restoration," noted brickman, as cooks could hide unappealable ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Typical mixtures were tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cuisine minds.
During their search for the book, which includes recipes, brickman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunch," Coe says.
Brickman continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many household recipes.
As never before or since, household economics - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have driven the country's eating habits like that.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "Housing Policies" and the challenge of transforming pamps like creamy Spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals, justifying.
A Square Meal is a festival of historical delicates.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens are tasty, as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his cuisine, he was feeding like the millions of heavy man of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumbersauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost golden dining room and wore a smoke.
He was superbly realistic.
President Roosevelt may have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, would not have asked him to stat a sample with his stomach.
As described in the book, the dwelling of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial preparations."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs.
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said brickman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple indicated that the eating habits of brickman’s mother-in-law were better understood - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of the waste of food," said Coe.
Brickman remembered: "She actually made people sick."
There was the wind pocket accident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plumenary, which President Roosevelt at noon.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Brickman and added that it was a usual trick to miss modest recipes a send name.
There was no beaten cream, only plumes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was unwilling to enter a leap into the tough, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it did not taste badly.
Coe took a three-time reference.
Like a can-do boy, he said to his wife, "A few hacked whalenuts would help."
At bomb attack, he was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life in the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others life.
Now the 30-year-old died even in a fass bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group, who, according to the image magazine, saved almost 60,000 people.
2900 Volunteers play their own lives in order to draw people from buried houses and to provide first assistance in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilian protector, which shows him in 2014 about the world when he was rescued by an infants from the ruins of a house.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the grey of war.
But as heroes he never saw himself, he said, "For me, this is the real Jihad."
"If I die to save life, I think that God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar attacked himself, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters threw four bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathing.
"We now remove the poisonous remains of the bomb, so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest spinal animal is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in the winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship of Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with well a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Grönlandhaie only gets offspring at 150 years of age.
Gem swims along the grounds of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on an average of 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to matt 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a robbe with this maximum speed.
However, this slow lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the specialist journal "Science" in any case from a Greenlandhai that could be 392 years old.
"Wanning", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for wire animals.
Although the evolution biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are being stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, and they live especially in the eismer in front of the thinly occupied coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks accordingly.
They measured their time looping rate when they equipped six animals with a broadcaster in front of Spitzbergen.
Still, these sharks do: In the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a robe, another had swallowed the jaws of a young ice bear.
Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrouillize on the grounds of the ice cream and look for cadaver torching from higher water layers down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which took fishermen from the depth of the North Atlantic from 2010 to 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeter was measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon 14 method.
This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, and the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempted to swallow larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, the lens core, with 220 centimeter length, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons attempts, so it probably celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 during his investigation.
On the other hand, all the larger greenland sharks had normal carbon 14-mengens in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14-hour for a 493 centimeter long greenlandhai showed a age of 335 years, while the record hay with 502 centimeters may be even 392 years old.
It was known that Grönlandhai-Weibchen would only get offspring if they were longer than four meters.
Now the researchers of the length were able to arrange a age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of gender maturity and his age was determined 156, Greenland sharks with the increase are apparently at least one and a half centuries.
This is also supposed to be a world record for spinal animals at present.
The fact that such methusalms live mainly in ice waters is not a coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old greenland whale, in whose pick was a 120-year-old harpoon tip on the neck, was also caught before Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on sparrow flames.
So they'll mature later - and aging slowly.
In order to keep themselves warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," explains the evolution biologist Scheuerklein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in the double pack
The municipal council has discussed issues around construction in the recent meeting.
With relief, the Board noted the Mayor Robert Putz's communication that "in the end the marketing of the recently designated housing areas can begin".
After clarifying the question of landing, parceling and closing and the requests for measurement, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Bereich Binderstraße - Ausbauabschnitt 1) is nothing more in the way to interested persons.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schönau address young families and well-equipped seniors as well.
As it was said, construction volunteers can immediately report in the town hall, the municipal council is expected to consult the parcels in its September session.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other businesses in connection with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the newly created area use plan in sub-areas in the spring of this year.
For example, in the sub-time larn area, the already designated commercial area is extended by two parcels towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city at Main thus has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt is most benefiting from the Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport they have so far been authorized in Great Britain.
That's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced to shift jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs at the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest euro area banks, as well as other important authorities such as European insurance supervision and the ESRB Risk Council.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the note bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg has a large fund industry, it is worse to cut down in the infrastructure as well as Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city has easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine are also the rentals for high-quality commercial property by 50 percent higher than at the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offered a higher quality of life than competition due to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's corporate consultancy, the city stood on the seventh place, Luxembourg on the 19th place, Dublin on the 33th place and Paris on 37th place.
Even if life quality is a question of favour: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW concludes.
However, despite Brexit Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
For this purpose, the power relationships also speak: According to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba, in London, about 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from Hepatitis C Patentstreit with Merck
A U.S. officer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs that you had received from the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was freed from a damage payment of $200 million for the violation of two patents from Merck, which were related to the Sovaldi and Harvoni Blockbuster Medicines of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including the Myides and other unethical acts.
When the complaint was raised on Thursday, U.S. officer Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to grant the costs that occurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to compare with Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck defended each other and claimed property for laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's medications.
U.S.-supported troops say that they have recovered full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
By the US-supported troops, the complete control of the northern city of Manbij has eroded near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters have left them in the city, said a spokesman of the group on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DCS) flame through after the exclusion of the remaining group of fighters that have buried within the city, the city currently.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as hostages, Sharfan Darwish informed the Manbij Army Council of Reuters.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are doing cleanup work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax declaration for 2015 on Friday, which revealed an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for well-being purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost $5.3 million in speech honorars; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published his tax statements with his wife Anne Holton for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
In a sharp contrast with this, Donald Trump hides behind false expressions and withdrawals to publish his tax statements in relation to his previous promises.
It is common for US presidency candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not obliged by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You are on the train," wrote Clinton's elector Ian Sams on Twitter, as regards the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special consultant, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax checks were not completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets, his donations to well-being organisations, his business gestures and various other links, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-level Republican Trump calls for his tax declaration.
On Thursday, she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that during the 1990s Trump has paid no or only very little taxes for two years, and on Friday, an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers who indicate that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a scheme designated after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that persons earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, called on Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Industriekonglomerat has its seat here to exchange Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said that he had been undergoing a tax check from the IRS and Trump had "angered" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax declaration back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, averaged an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40,5%.
The 2015 Clintons tax declaration showed that only USD 100 of their income was paid, unlike most of all Americans.
Its main investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109.000 taxed.

Condoms with Chilipuder, foaming bodies promote Tanzanias Elephant Protection
Nature guardians in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipods.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of it years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzanias to use a violent four-level method to protect their houses and harvest without hurting animals.
Previously, many spears have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed the toolkit, we have been able to see a change in their attitude within these communities, while they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said the CEO of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a fake and bubble in a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called "Chiliwolke" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, whose end is turned up to the ignorance.
When it is infected, the condom bursts up with a bubble and sprays fine dust to chipids into the air.
Usually, a touch is already going out to hunt the elephant.
A last possibility is a Werfer who shoots a gold - rain firework in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No Kiosk New Construction at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, St. Goarer's investment projects of business operators with kiss hand are considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the request for the rebuilding of a sales skiosks at the Rheinufer near the Rhinebalkon in the construction was now unanimously rejected.
"We generally welcome new commercials, but at this location in exponented location at the Rheinufer, this Kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director breaks Berliner Hotel because Israeli elections were removed after "arabic" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unveiled a media intrusion after he betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre-election because, according to one employee, it would have "demanded Arab guests".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" released his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country-choosing list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via its own Call Center.
Looking for a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "socked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it was even more angry in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have required the choice to be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were disturbed and upset by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has contributed in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even even more shameful.
This does not require an explanation.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty large resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole of it a scandal.
Some believed to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "gived" the alleged invitations of Arab guests.
"Shame you," it was said in another contribution, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all accusations of himself and called the incident a "failed" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, reports The mirror.
"There was never a direct instruction," Israel did not take into the Quick Choice List," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country choice has now been added.
Police employs tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of São Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to collapse the students, which led the police to use rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their disturbance over the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the state of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen to spray graffitits against the provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in mass to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been disfellowshipped by a voting of the Senate for their revocation from the office.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the commercial turnover between Moscow and Teheran grew by 70.9 percent in the year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been repealed, the interest on Russian companies has grown strongly on businesses in the country, the ambassador has informed.
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran, while new companies are willing to access the market.
Of course, the further development of trade is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million.
The rescue was achieved by supplies of machines, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is starting from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representative issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries, as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken last year, "he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the towns of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good state," he said.
Witnesses searched for: Drinking market in Forest oil
A robbery was practiced on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
In the face of a gun, three dark-clothed persons who had mummed their faces demanded the production of cash from the staff of the drinking market and then first fled on foot and then probably with a silver VW golf.
How much money was spent, the police don't share.
The perpetrators should have been between 1,60 and 1,70 meters, i.e. relatively small.
The drinking market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and badly viewable.
The perpetrators must have fleeed from the scotter park opposite the entrance of the park with the silver car, perhaps towards B 256.
Anyone who has made observations in connection with the robbery at the time of action (as at 19.45 p.m.) is to report urgently to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer free time
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and adolescents of the social pedagogical daily group/social group work of the Kinderschutzbund Nagold with their supervisors at their summer free time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtwuldle, the lifetime group was crossed during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
First of all, it went to Bretten with the visit of the Streichelzoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special kinderführung in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the daily life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group at the Deep Sea in Maulbronn enjoyed a pleasure, which invited to jump, swim and plane.
Culinary children and maintainers were spoiled with their self-prepared body nutritions such as the Sauren Laätzle, the Seabronn peanle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, static, beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings on fire and the final "bunt evening".
On the day of the home trip, the sun laughed, and the children and young people returned satisfied.
Haigerloch: pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministrants from Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were travelling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were handled together.
In order to bridge the time up to the next romwall ride of all ministrants over two years, St. Anna's Oberministrantenrunde has decided to prepare and implement a multiday pilgrim migration.
Several pilgrimage goals were examined and the decision was finally taken for the Bishops' City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim goal was offered with the gate of mercy to open to this end at Freiburger Münster.
16 minis made of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and saint rooms were on the way.
In the evening before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrim segens.
From Horb was driven by train at the start of Villingen, where also a Münster of Our Dear wife stands and thus the pilgrim path was stepped up from Münster.
The individual daily tours were framed by a short impulse in the morning and evening with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis made constant rest on field crossings, chapels or churches to sing together a song of specially composed pilgrimage.
The local parishes were available for the overnight stays.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a delicious and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day it went over Furtwangen after Gütenbach.
On the next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most difficult roadway, had to go down about 500 metres of heat at the first time, and then again be climbed.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery of St. Peter, it went to Freiburg.
At the later afternoon, the minis arrived at Freiburger Münster and passed through the pforts of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minims arrived at the pilgrim destination of Cooperator Markus Obert were welcomed.
After worship, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristi and the high altar.
The next day was time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
Shotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brite rings gold for cycling
Schottlands Callum Skinner cracked last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll that his landsman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself own. The boy spund proudly made the legend when he crashed home to home a victory of the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympia gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Railway Championships despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as Hindes.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the scotch that has now evolved.
Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner put an Olympic Record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries won in the first round.
And the British Trio won the Duell with gold.
Hindes was almost back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A strategy change made a large part of the transformation, where Hindes went in a higher direction to slow it down and enable Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes when they rose to the podest.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We have set up a Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012, at Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell on the train.
He later revoked this statement and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
This time there was no such problem in such a superb victory.
Hindes said, "It feels like all the GB flags on the tribute like London."
We've come together in the last three months as a team.
We have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was incredibly to win back at the Olympiad.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in Velodrom.
With the form of Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a exploitation of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's what Hoy's gonna do.
Kenny next takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "When he wins two other gold medals, he should be be struck as a rider."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the destination in 3:51.942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competitors, where Wiggins will certainly be focused.
He had argued with officers before the qualification yesterday when functionaries called him to measure his body size.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4:13.260.
The GB team leaves on its strong rail bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a lot of medals.
After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were dropped.
It played dramas in the background, so the resignation of technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexual and mobing ideas as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first evening of competition in Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary call GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland's melting because of the withdrawal of the Energy Treaty
The future of Portland's aluminium melting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and thus lifts all the supply contracts, as the supplying energy company reported.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to not grant further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing.
In addition, there could be Domino effects, as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry meltery, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.
The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which delivers the large aluminum melting with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, told that it is assumed that three other owners will cancel their contracts.
The plant is located in the majority of a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting industry," the company informed.
AGL continued to declare that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month cancellation period so that they will end in 2017.
"AGL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on AGL revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $187 million in "demand for a cancellation".
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts, the "competency of Alcoas... to operate the melting or to ensure the supply of electricity to the melting industry" does not affect.
The U.S. company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a declaration why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analytics warn because of the poor economic conditions of the industry against the possible closure of portland melting in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Regarding the statements of analytics at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a electricity producer," he said.
More than just one Kardashian Reality TV Star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the popular September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, who is a brand messenger of Estee Lauder and runs on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to weep," wrote Kendall.
The cover's enthusiasm followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video, which shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz-enkels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgot the cover of her sister and ended with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clice-based act almost every birthday sepisode of a child's mission (Seacrest gave the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a drawing cinnamon at a broadcasting place at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians certainly began.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to beat her on the Vogue-Cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for herself.
The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.
With a range that is more similar to a tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the forest 615 pages advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is so desirable that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have passed through before official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "prominences that models" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar prize winner and Dior brand messenger Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "through-up model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (also if all of this applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are characterized in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of their career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit excited.
In June, the one-time Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the filthy pieces of the moment."
These feelings cooked up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.
But it seems that it's going to pass on the point of misgiving.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is a super model in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter from her made to LOVE magazine.
And in her leisure time she's seen in the reality TV, probably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
City centres reject 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's most needy aid are rejected annually by the municipal rights centres, while the industry is focusing on the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five persons - mostly older persons, immigrants, helpful workers, victims of violence and those who do not have any means of injustice and similar delegation - are rejected in their request for free consultation and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessly exaggerated, are ready for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of Queesland Common Rights Centres James Farrell said that the final survey of the National Association of Municipal Rights Centres showed that thousands of people are already being rejected each year.
Farrell said that without abolition of the Federal Government's decision, the situation would only become worse.
"Queensland municipal rights centres are chronic underfinanced, which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with insurmountable and oppressive debts, families who go through separation, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems legally and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The Federal Government will shorten the resources by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more desirable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the General Bundesanwalt and Federal Minister of Justice as well as the Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal centres and their client communities, as well as the Palazczuk government invests in this important work.
Donald Trump Election Campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled weapons
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inactivity after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun to a employee in February while they were traveling in a jeep.
The incident is described in a claim submitted by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday in Charlotte's State Court, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said to have waited for months that the matter would be dealt internally before he realized that "it wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "trok a gun, put his right point finger on the deduction, and ramped the run in Vincent's Kniekehle," said Bordini in his accusation.
After complaining at the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other persons had already experienced Phillip, he stated in the accusation.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini.
The accusation comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a rebellion when he said a crowd of people in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - shoe owners and gunsfriends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton should be elected and judged.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had cracked his words out of the context and that he wouldn't stumble to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires damage from the campaign to violate the care obligation and Philip because of body injury and lasting mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks could not be reached for an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
Not responded to calls at his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidency candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The proceedings are Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: lose SPD and CDU
During the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) significant losses for the government parties are deemed to be SPD and CDU.
This gave representative surveys of INSA's opinion research institute for the "image" period (freeday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal countries, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have good opportunities to continue to put the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party is only lying in front of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
Left to 19 percent (formerly 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country day.
The greens, despite light losses, with 6 percent (before 8.7 percent) resume the heavy day of the country.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 percent each in the country day.
In the Berlin election of Members, the SPD of the survey said that only 23 percent of the data would be available (Selection 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the greens by 19 percent (2011: 17,6 percent), but before the left by 15 percent (formerly 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope to return, on the other hand, that the pirates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a desaser.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it was not well in hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clever.
The built-in memory was at the beginning of eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with a high resolution today.
A iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came to business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can buy the devices still on the Internet, but they are somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish cell phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit Computer Fair in Hannover as the "Büro in Westentaschenformat".
In fact, the new mobile phone could have a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the Communicator was to be reached.
Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser, although painfully slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black-white screen were found.
The price was very proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could realize in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The wise phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The phone part of the Finns experienced an unprecedented desaster, was finally sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market masters suppliers who all came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere to be online, this is for many people everyday life.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, from Samsung and Apple alone 555 million pieces.
The global turnover with the devices is around EUR 400 billion.
This includes the well-run businesses of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came until the beginning of 2007, at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet Communicator to easily operate everything via touch screen.
The victory of Apple began, still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the attention.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The sayings now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a natural one for 20 years after its invention.
In the meantime, every German now looks 88 times a day at his cell phone.
"We all need to learn to remove the smartphone," said Janina Kugel, responsible for staff in the Siemens board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring innovation and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as we did in 2012 in London, when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And this will again be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will create 10,000 new teaching places alone, 40,000 new jobs, and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the Heathrows enlargement is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The twoflers were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked to him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in spatial growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment around both the airport and the entire GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - which was chosen five years after the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequent runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It's time for us to guide this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and ensure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and Mouse game" regarding adblocking
For companies earning money online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to avoid adblocking, a "chatz and mouse game" is the same.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising again in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook informed that his desktop page would change the coding of its advertisements in order to make it difficult to detect display blocks about which part of the ads page is.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to handle the new codes.
In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-her fight between the ad-blocking open source community and the surroundings has been in progress since the invention of adblockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company for social media has joined the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a last year study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use adblockers; almost four times so many in 2013.
With 1,03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile end devices every day, manual drive out 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenues.
The company has noted it on adblockers on Desktop PCs, as mobile adblockers do not have any effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker informed.
Advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues, so Facebook appears to be worthwhile to invest such a step.
On Tuesday Facebook informed that it would update his "advertisement preference tool" to have people more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be anxious to new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"For users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a spokesman of Facebook informed in an e-mail communication.
Adblockers are a stumped means, so we have concentrated on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in the hands of people.
Ms. at probably suicide on the Swiss motorway
The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.
The police call on witnesses after a woman was crossed in the early morning on Thursday at a presumably suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman sat on the road in the dark "in a despair act" and was hit by several cars, the police in Waadt said.
It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 who was overrided by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She died on site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police said that they, as well as any witness of the incident, would call on them to report.
A investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not taken to responsibility.
In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running on the motorway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policeman of negligent killing was freed after she had crossed and killed a man who was one night on A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became conscious on the road, the court took over.
The court found that the policeman - who had responded to an emergency call - was justified and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfect exceptional and unpredictable situation", said the judge.
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have demonstrated earthlike conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 density.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turning of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and still slowly turn on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to host life and protect from fast evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turning of the Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella to protect the surface from much of the sun's warmth.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution, which was previously suspected by planet researchers.
Although it was once probably inhabitable, the Venus -- over several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a fatal greenhouse effect – the Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.

On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as a trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and led to a too low right of participation in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and remarked that the association will immediately look for a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and certainty," said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
Over the summer, I have been thinking about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth, this is what it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly tailored to those of the organization.
He must also have a right to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions for the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14, Roy was a winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the League.
He led the club at 112 points and at the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesota and missed the season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot at the Western Conference with five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume discussions, strike
Labour struggles with regard to the wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all the dispute parties are sitting at the table for a new round of discussions, the negotiating leader said.
Streiks against the Wood Group oil field service provider were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Units and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few whole-day meetings in the next weeks, which will begin in the beginning of the next year to re-establish the problems.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group reduced the rate of its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The rate reduction of the company follows a 10% drop for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the necessary space to come through the market decline.
Shell has released thousands of people for his part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its business as a result of its mega-consolidation with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower rohelp trip, an economic situation which had increased by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Member Dave Anderson met working leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
2016 is expected less than $1.4 billion of expenditure on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star hops of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the stars of the Pleiades.
The new data helps the astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the star sky and in what context the rotational periods are with the planet development.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star skys, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age, and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star hop of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star hop, which came about about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adult age.
They're turning faster now.
These mature stars evaporate large amounts of star winds at peak rotation rates.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of an recognized star spot -- as sunshine.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are slower to rotate than fewer massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the star hops of the Plejades are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare static qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star hop of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the sterile rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
It's still much before us about what we want to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and as it were, hanging their "dancing shoes" on.
In three newspaper reports, Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of Plejade's rotational rates, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star turns off
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will last be wearing the Trikot of his New York Yankees on August 12, against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time all-star game participants of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
In 2009, Rodriguez won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a 10-year contract gave him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.
By the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will continue to act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez with performance for a long time.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and since 2005 he created a few milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the fame hall of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
In 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN" that between 2001 and 2003 forbidden steroids were taken.
In August 2013, he was blocked for 211 parties in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to have been the most suspicious for years to have received through an anti-age clinic in southern Florida.
After a dispute, the block was still reduced to 162 encounters.
"The League could even have done a pleasure for the year 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at that time sufficant.
His departure days also do not run inclined.
While many baseball legends were given the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," added Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and was told about the condition with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy confessions from the fans of the Yankee archrivals Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang against the Rodriguez team at the 4:9 deposit.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Fucked: Because of a positive doping sample, the weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio cannot start.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A frozen athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh match day, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
China's swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000 metre hidary runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critically accused light athletic competitions, these messages come on time.
During Chen last Sunday, the diuretics of hydrochlorothiazide had been demonstrated, which is used as a masking medicine for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had placed the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, and only 0.09 seconds later she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the predecessors over 50 m free style.
Chen requested the opening of B-Probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands Chen's full cooperation in the investigations," said Xinhua from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CAS and accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio sickered the message about the positive sample at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV-sender BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplementary," said the light athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is intended to be the EPO blood-doping agent.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-Probe should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow spoke immediately with criticism to the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight lifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympician in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively to the anabole steroid Nandrolon as his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both contradict the intake, but both must not start up to 94 kg in the class.
Before the start of the light athletes, especially the Danekowa case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Association of IAAF had forbidden the complete Russian team to an exception for systematic dopings, including the runneration of Kenya produces many bad news in Rio.
In the Swimming Sports, the former crimes in China had also caused severe conflicts between the athletes.
The French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic Sun Yang harshly.
"Son Yang pinks lila."
"When I see the podium over 200 m free style, I want to pass myself," Lacourt said in the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a conflict with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudors," said this one.
Sun had been tested positively to the Stimulans Trimetazid in 2014 at the Chinese championships but had to sit only a three-month lock.
Data clue: So perfide press hackers their ransom
Programmers of expressing malware currently attack targeted companies - and are successful.
According to a current survey of malware-protection specialist malware-bytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once over the past 12 months, partially several victims of an attack with erpressor-software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies had already been the target of a ransomware pressure.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the solvents required by the offenders to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The offenders specialize their extortion software according to the observations of malwarebytes watching attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially exacerbating ransom is significantly higher than in private users.
"We are currently watching an alarming fast evolution of the damaging software," explains malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World".
In 2008 most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered expression software for themselves.
Only private users were the goal, but the change to company attacks has been alarmingly fast in the past months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it is searching for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals sustainablely.
Then the software presents the demands of the extortioners.
To get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the crypto currency Bitcoin.
However, where private users are at stake with the personal photo database, businesses are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is silent.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware adds.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business activity completely, in one case people were in risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of diseases.
"We always say to the victims, don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the claims of the offenders, given that they are still in operation.
The hackers know that again and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contacts with the compressors and come to the result: The offenders are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat, how to pay by bitcoin, provide freely accessible support websites, or decrypt for nothing example files.
And after payments of a few hundred euros, private people will have to negotiate companies in part hard and pay five-digit amounts to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from the Ransomware pressure, the hackers become more professional and share the work, explains safety experts Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus Provider Sophos: "A single person can write a Ransomware circa within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their damaging software to the actual extortioners in the form of a software building.
The previous malware kits were created by buying malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"In the scope of delivery is an adaptation tool that allows smaller configurations, appearance and burning to be changed," says Wisniewski.
The extortioners then search for more hackers to distribute the newly purchased software to the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Of course, the criminals then order Spammer with the distribution," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies who better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company-IT responsible in the malwarebytes survey trust to be able to resist Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful eruption, then the offenders threaten with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski.
This makes the potential for damage even more than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new goals on the Internet of things on the corn.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how to get a thermostat connected with the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the release of such blocked heating could well be worth some victims a ransom.
If the perpetrators block a whole production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V works rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the fond, it does not work closely at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasantly, only the cockpit surface drops something.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage room.
There is not only a suitcase room of 453 l at high-level and 1026 l at folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the back bank can be folded up like cinema bases and thereby offer steam space from the ground to the ceiling 1.24 m high.
The suitcase can be loaded well, but the charge height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The 1.6-l diesel tested with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V, thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he is supposed to do his work a little quieter.
Delightful is the daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l-benziner with 96 kW/130 PS.
A all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not open any wishes in the tested top version "Executive".
Among the security systems is the City Notbrems Assistant (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track stop assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles when ranging as "coming objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliable.
And the intelligent tempo regulator responds to the traffic sign detection and drowns the speed if necessary.
The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI book are below the armrest and are therefore a bit ambiguous to reach.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
If you do not want to invest so much, you will receive the petroleum from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and daily car.
Airline is not liable: crash on air passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because a liability is only possible in the case of dangers typical of air traffic, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Act: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff broke a knee disc at the crash.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay any damage to the man.
Disease: When the organizer pays
Distressed vacationers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is doubtless to be found in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests proved to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, on the second day of their Turkey holiday, a family was severely sick of diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost all the holidays in the room.
Their disease led the holidayers to a defective cleaning plant, which supposedly had contaminated the seawater.
The family believed that the journey had been inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the applicants had no success.
Although the clearing system was in fact defected.
But the organizer only learned from it shortly before the applicants left.
He had to assume that the sea water was all right until then.
He did not violate his information obligations, so the judgment.
No contaminations have been found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several guests - maybe by infection among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violences committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would have been worried about further attacks.
The State has to reason and respond determinedly to terror threats at the same time.
Surely our land will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We're not gonna give the terrorist this triumph.
If criminals would have to leave the country faster, however, this increases security and also strengthens the consent of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals until the Bundestagswahl 2017.
He also announced a further personal strengthening of the security forces, "in the middle four-digit order for several years".
Sympathy for terrorism must again be punished.
Video surveillance is intended to improve the novelling of weapons law so that it is especially difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much debated silence obligation for doctors is to be observed according to Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the medical community he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk of citizens, he said, in view of psychic remarks.
In order to combat radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
In order to persecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans the use of concealed intellectuals.
SPD-Chef Gabriel said, "The SPD is willing to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of Interior clearly spoke against actionism.
"This was an ear for the scarfmaker in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel said the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Freeday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
A general prohibition of full-breaking, he considers that constitutional law is problematic.
You can't forbid everything you're rejecting, and I'm not wearing the Burka.
You can talk about rules such as road transport or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter suggested to the minister that he wanted to simulate action and action with always new anti-terror packages.
Left partner chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotte Proverbs and an intensification of the right of residence no longer bring the people in that country security."
Better traffic flow on the motorway provider
It stands regularly on the reversal road - here a picture of November.
But this is to change: the right-hand track is to be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are in the professional traffic on the surrounding road every evening in the steep when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16./17. August) in the area between the Hammer Road and the Weseler Road depart, the road extends the right-hand side by 700 meters.
Car drivers can then fit directly from the Hammer Street on the right.
The great advantage: the traffic is arbitrarily split up, improving the overall expiry of the widespread section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representing Münster-West.
The driveway reduction on the supplier nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.
Working days, the backstairs reach the bridge above the Albersloh path and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the needle tube on the B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler Road.
From here the traffic is only one-sided across the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well three quarters ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary force to take up heavy load traffic two-purely.
How long this Engpass and the associated working day stew will last, the competent state operation cannot say.
However, there are years to be expected: because the bridge has an official residual duration by the year 2034.
For the extension of the right-of-course, the country's operation has deliberately chosen the weaker time in school holidays because there are disabilities to be expected.
The traffic will be led one-purely by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural travel: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The invisible House".
The company Nima's and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the prize-winning piece "Das unsichtbare Haus" of the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by the company Nima, 19 students from 11 to 15 years of age visited the stage in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster under this project.
Most of the teenagers of the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among other things, from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations, they had been able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The company Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Talel, and the young theatre will work together in the coming playtime in the context of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people will be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, play and music with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatral language mediation are in planning.
The "Intercultural Travel" project continues.
In view of the rising refugee numbers, the association expects to participate with many classes.
Rain instead of star snippets: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the starry snippets in the southwest of Germany a line through the invoice in the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited for clouds and rains to observe the spectacle of the sky, the chairman of Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see many star snippets in the sky.
The starships are Perseiden, who are one of the fastest star snippets at 216000 kilometres per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus that rises in the northeast.
Relaxing night: Tips for sleeping disorders
In the evening, you're always waking around, at night you'll be vigilant for hours, and in the morning you can't remember sleeping.
That's all but relaxing.
After all, you are with such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleeping disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
How are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders expressed?
There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there can be many causes for them, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, Executive Board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What one understands in general is the insomnia, i.e. a sleeping and sleeping disturbance.
Especially sleeping, many people feel inadequate or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Executive Board of the German House Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleeping disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Thereafter, organic, psychological or behavioural factors can be placed, but also medicines.
Not rarely, sleeping disorder is the expression of another disease.
"Very early wake up is mostly common in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, if you have a tape crash, you can lie badly, wait up every two to three hours and may begin to grind over everyday problems and cares, weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when should you get a doctor with sleep disorders?
If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, weeß recommends.
The impairment may look quite different: one has been dissolved, tired, unslapping, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical disturbances such as stomach or headaches.
To reduce the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There is hardly any sleeping medicine in Germany, stressing Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.
For this reason, when sleeping problems occurs, weeß advises you to contact the doctor.
It can determine with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleeping lab, and what's going on?
For example, medical doctors advise to study in the sleep laboratories in snarchs with atemaussetzers, in sickness of day tiredness, in sleep wandering or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normal.
"Don't go to sleep only," says Fietze.
After wiring you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body you wear a nose glass, a chest belt and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleepers.
How can those affected overcome the problems?
There are quite a lot of screws that can be used for better sleep.
Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and uprising times, not too long in bed, not sleeping in the day, not watching away for sleeping, avoiding alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is quite not helpful at all.
What the jungle camp has to have with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken on Facebook for the disappointing cutting off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he took gold at the short-way world championships in Doha, while at the same time recording his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler has been protecting from his ex-team colleagues in criticism.
"In a country where an Olympician receives 20,000€ premium and a jungle king of 150,000€ should no one marvel at missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old at night on Friday on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, but doping controls are very good.
This does not enable us to compete with countries that are very prosperous and do not look at or even engage in the subject of doping.
"I don't say that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler should have been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).
Likewise, it should be kept with countries.
"Who can't be controlled by independent controlurs of WADA/FINA for a certain time before the WM/OS, can't participate," demands the Chamburg election, who now operates an ice-stone.
Airport: Bands of luggage thieves arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, civilians of the Dusseldorf police succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
The suspects of action had committed several pockets and luggage thiefs as bands.
At 21.30 a.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to the police from past theft.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July this year and had been engaged in Community, employment and particularly professional.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four deeds to the thieves, who were specifically entering into Germany for criminal offences.
A total of over 15,000 euros had been charged.
Old buildings, some Lindenbäumchen, still a rest of the headstone plant: The Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at the first glance, but the police are one of the "rising places" of the city.
Going along the road from east to west, you pass on playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bioshop.
To the façade of a gray house, someone spoke "because of!"
Against a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here.
Articles on this "driving district", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
Reason is the house number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have rent contracts, but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Especially Berlin's interior senator Henkel has been pronounced several times since the beginning of the year for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the spaces on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police said that for three weeks officials and three team cars on the spot were patroled, spared parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
In the meantime, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners.
On July 13th, a Berlin administrative court decided that the restoration had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers took off under the joy of sympathisants and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the burgeon in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergarten.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, have been generated mainly by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects they share the concern of rising rentals and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a Kiez who wished to protect the majority of police against vandalizing left.
The grave, which the Berlin senator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors, does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was a traditional working district, which has a low average income and high poverty risk today compared to the rest of the city.
Also house occupations and the residential projects born from it have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the whole Mainzer street very close to the Rigas.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a fair street battle under great police order, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaians and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the city section has become an increasing magnet for tourists and electoral advisors from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents from DDR times and former house owners now share their kiez.
This is also noticeable in the rentals, which have increased by almost 60 percent in relocations since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigas are attacked as symbols for this development: you recognize them of thrown discs or freshly striped facades, which have been covered with colour bags.
No other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason that not all neighbors view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injuries, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the criminal offences constitute material damages that tend to meet the new buildings and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, cannot be spoken of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94s are their neighbors who have certainly not been.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer in the Rigas.
For the studied architect, her road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from one another than else."
Neugebauer has deliberately moved to the Riga street - and stayed.
Therefore, it was so important for the residents to return their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July.
However, in the eyes of residents like new builders, the road continues to take them away: through fascinating new buildings in former building gaps that push the old inhabitants.
"These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - here people who are not so well-dated live," she says.
"I can't approve of violence and destruction."
But what should you do if you never listen to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry with color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.
Whoever draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a peanut district can badly complain about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deussel is a new refugee officer
Annika Deussel is the contact partner in matters of integration and organiser.
She is also a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deussel has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social teacher supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as a contact partner for all stakeholders: refugees, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and others.
Regine Kunde from the working circle indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-leading wollmilchsau, which has, above all, a problem.
For example, some - less ridiculous than the number of targeted areas of tasks - had meant as the administration wanted to write out the office.
A administrative skill was sought with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in social work, just a self-leading wollmilk sau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deussel.
Above all, it is about organization, work with people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.
The 31-year-old has been involved for about six weeks.
She has been a 50-percentage chair for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deussel supports honoring and main official actors.
There are major and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the follow-up refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate refugees in their own or rented housings.
The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to municipality and job centers.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto does not find any private apartments for the administration.
It does not work so far, if you are dependent on private apartments, says Deussel.
Consequently, residential apartments must be disciplined, as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers are set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it's not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are stakeholders, training centres, schools, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the farm or help housemasters, do non-profit work - and that motivated and very decent, as Annika Deussel reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
That's "no employment therapy."
But activity doesn't just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are weird.
So also there are administrations and honorary officials.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they were wanted and welcomed in Germany.
The long term of procedures is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and that they can overtake the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who develops the feeling that he could help nobody in Urbach, may not work and be unusable, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, Kunde honestly says, "no-one who is doing anything at all". Therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.
All of this is already a "mummut" task.
A difficult question: Do they have fear of radicalization after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some can call naive," but a rest risk could and would not exclude them.
But the helpers are already sensible.
These incidents are also subject to refugees.
They'd have the fear that the attackers put them completely in custody.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and honorary officials in the area and in the region must look for activities.
They always have in the background that soon a new strike of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, politics is scared.
Actually, it's unfair to put her helpers on the spot.
"In Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are also exaggerated to integrate the people to date reasonablely.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in distress, they need to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: burglar searched with helicopter
