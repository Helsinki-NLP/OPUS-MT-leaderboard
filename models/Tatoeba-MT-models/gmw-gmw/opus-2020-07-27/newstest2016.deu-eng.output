Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not really friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, it is also intended to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been excited for years.
Washington criticizes the ongoing settlement building of Israel and suggests Netanyahuâ€™s lack of will in the peace process.
Through the Obama deal on the Iranian nuclear programme, the relationship of the two has further deteriorated.
In March, Netanyahu held a controversial speech on the invitation of the Republicans to the U.S. Congress, which was partly evaluated as an affront against Obama.
The speech was not spoken with Obama, and a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election in Israel that was in his day.
In an emergency call, Professor stands to shoot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told with a shameful voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was criticized of a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school site, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb did the devastating emergency call some time after that.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamm took life when the police embroidered him.
One day after shooting at the university, the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get an image of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him, helped to draw an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teachers include 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time there were some inclinations to problematic behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 he had to deal with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a certificate for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, for which the lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to arrange as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that lamb can't answer anymore.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lamb's track when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 calibre gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and educational education.
He studied education in the spring.
One of Lamb's long-standing friends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met by common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's swarm at that time.
All girls melt there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were apparently a while together.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-eheman of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed by the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail appeared on a summer-year market three years ago.
Later they played one or another Gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a softly illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmonica game before a spicy audience.
There was no evidence that anything was wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and shaking together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of shit.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the student committee.
On Tuesday evening, there were about 900 people at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, including teachers, employees, students and members of the municipality at a candlelight memorial celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwache, while the university scor "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lesson will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We try to move our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm called his wife in his emergency call Prentiss, but there is no indication that they have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to stop less workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toys and baby products dealers say that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to stop 40,000 people in shops and sales centres throughout the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 people were stopped.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will begin with application talks and the number of employees rises from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to set up time workers to rent shops with employees who sell, send, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox shit about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat is empty next to me, and it becomes gradually clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary film "Back in Time".
The film starts, and it comes to me that I am a simulated goat and a army length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had 30 years ago premiere.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "incontroversy the largest time travel movie ever turned."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday a press conference that he intends to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the margin of the General Assembly's General Assembly meeting to discuss the situation in Syria this month.
He regretted that the escalation in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the face of the crisis in Syria that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Surveillance values that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others have defeated him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks at surveys, it has (now) not worked.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Trump in the two-digit area, and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate moguls.
Of course it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that Rick Perry's leadership was issued to the ascending Herman Cain in 2011, of which no one won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have been fighting in a general choice.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's sustainability and start running their dollars to crash him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned by 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidateship in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August there were 52 percent.
Now 6 out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP elections would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they would be "delighted" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Just two out of ten say they would be "angered" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "interested" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next thing about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican electors say that they would be "uncomfortable" or "annoyed" if Jeb Bush, the favourite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of the Irish electors tending to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think he has the personality for a chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican electors are accustomed to the idea.
When they set up their scholarly guards, Republican elector Trump believes that they are real.
If they are asked who is the first to win the GOP nomination, after a CNN/ORC survey from last week four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP choosers did not have the clearest crystal balls in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it is shown that a variety of GOP-selectors view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still strikes almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffus.
But a survey by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetic head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority of support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who hits him?
Ben Carson would take over the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetic head-to-head race.
A scarce majority of Donald-Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have given their voices firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change this, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
46 percent said they let the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment of the other outside sides, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico two months ago, the immigration was a turning and fishing point in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the ramp light, it seems Donald Trump will do it too.
The frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have about half of the support of Republican electors, especially through their external status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new ABC/Post assembly survey, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry with Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa republicans are frustrated over the Republicans at the convention, with 54 percent "unfried" and 21 percent "heartedly annoyed".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential area - overlooking the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square metre of a Reetdach house costs on average 73.300 euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - that is why the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers cost one square metre most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square metre for a student house in Munich are not really few.
Unlike Germany's top resorts, one of the prizes is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & VÃ¶lkers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square metres prices in lucrative heights.
There are several ten thousand euros - per square metre, noted.
But well, whoever can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top.
Champions League: Bayern Dream Start thanks to MÃ¼ller and GÃ¶tze
Two-piece towers in PirÃ¤us: Bayern-Star Thomas MÃ¼ller just has a walk.
A happy hit by Thomas MÃ¼ller ebned the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos PirÃ¤us - then it ran.
A sovereign appearance of the Champions League season.
The world champion Thomas MÃ¼ller and Mario GÃ¶tze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the hexenkessel of PirÃ¤us.
The team of Trainers Pep Guardiola won her play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to MÃ¼llers doublepack (52./90.+2) and GÃ¶tzes match (89.) earned at 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth launcher in series is supposed to be the first step towards Finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
During his 28th match in the Champions League to the Bavarian leadership, MÃ¼ller received good help from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who lets pass a shot of the world champion.
"We won't underestimate them," said Bavarian captain Philipp Lahm before the game in the Karaiskakis-Stadion before 31.688 hot-blood fans - and the mouths held word.
They showed a concentrated and engaged idea without shining.
PirÃ¤us had won his youngest six home games in the king's class, including famous clubs such as Manchester United, AtlÃ©tico Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stolpered here (1:3).
But the Bavaria, unconquered in seven European cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageously running, but often in their offensive efforts, too uncomfortable to works.
The attacks were initiated too often by gambling on left outside Douglas Costa, who rarely passed through the former Braunschweige Omar Elabdellaoui.
MÃ¼ller had more luck from the right than his flanks from the right half field slipped in the left upper torque.
In the 67th minute, the world champion lost the possible 2:0.
The best occasions in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos storm Ideye Brown hit Poland's headball from the line (26.).
Then by direct withdrawal, the Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavaria took her usual dominant game, PirÃ¤u's needle stings were able to set.
On TorhÃ¼ter Manuel New, however, was abandoned.
For example, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the Latte (56.).
Before Newer, Guardiola defended a four chain with David Alaba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario GÃ¶tze, after muscular problems back in the box, first sat outside.
The World War gave green light only after the final training, said Sports Board Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to do something else from it, that's already malicious."
On the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59).
GÃ¶tze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made it clear 13 minutes later, by an elfmeter, MÃ¼ller put one more on it.
Before the game, Krawallen had arrived in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly mummed Bavaria fans in their watching block apparently provoked the followers of host PirÃ¤us with words and gestures, the security forces embarked and attacked the Munich trailers with strikes.
At least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke do not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - that suggests a potsdam long-term study.
The good news: In case of abandonment, the risk decreases rapidly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is shown in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smoking, smokers risked losing their teeth prematurely to increase the 2.5 to 3.6.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes for dental failure are caaries and inflammation of the tooth meat, the DIfE stresses.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The relationship between smoking and dental loss is therefore due to more frequent dental inflammations in smokers.
It is not clear to how much smoking increases the risk for caries.
However, people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years until the risk declined to the level of non-smoking, first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham explained.
You need to convince people to become non-smoking, study director Heiner Boeing of the DIfE said: "Rook shortens the lifetime."
Smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our insights, leads to good dental health until the age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population age 65 to 74 years of dentality are affected, DIfE notified.
Earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study undermines the findings.
Archaeologists encounter Cologne Rhineufer on rests from the late antique
For a repeated time on the right Rhineufer in Cologne archaeological findings have been made.
Near the construction site for the new Rhineboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German museum have excavated Skelette and remains of historical buildings, said Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always attracted as a specialist office for archaeological ground monument care.
In the third section of the Rhineboulevard, the archaeologists were now fought.
From text documents had already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves, which probably belonged to the church, had also been discovered.
Young woman of freight
After a young woman at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lndern has been misled, the federal police asks the population to help.
On the early Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the glue from the direction of railway buildings at the end of the railway station and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of MÃ¶nchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, it has suffered the most serious injuries through the detection of the train.
She was treated locally and sent by rescue forces to a hospital.
There are no findings on the grounds of the nightly crossing of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Individuals or passers of Linderner Bahn, ZiegelbÃ¤ckerweg, ThomashofstraÃŸe and Leiffarther StraÃŸe (L364) are in question.
Indications that give information about the cause of the accident can be given under the hotline of the Federal Police on telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police station around the clock.
EU Commission proposes in disputes about TTIP new court
The EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbitrary system to eliminate the dispute on the transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP.
Therefore, the controversial private simplification facilities for disputes between companies and states are to be solved by a more transparent system, which in its functioning way is much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said Commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, responsible for the idea.
The Swedish has proposed the proposal as a European negotiation position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans for reform of the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU States and the USA to select jointly independent judges for a new investment court.
They are intended to come to the same parts from the EU, the US and third countries.
For the first time there is also a second instance.
It would allow it to appeal against judgments.
Until now, the procedural parties agreed to arbitration judges, there was no opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, commented MalmstrÃ¶m.
In the long term, it intends to work on an International Investment Court according to its own information.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clarified.
The Investor-State-Schiedverfahren (ISDS) which was required mainly by large companies is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance to TTIP in Europe.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opposers as a kind of parallel justice, which enables companies to pay damage to taxpayers, to lift national laws, or to reduce consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta) already negotiated.
On the other hand, German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as a major progress.
The Commission considers essential points in the reform that Sigmar Gabriel, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, had drawn up with other EU trade ministers in spring.
The old system of private arbitration courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of MalmstrÃ¶m.
The European BusinessEurope Association warned that we should not limit the possibility of action in the economy through too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the discussions on the TTIP free trade agreement (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it continued to be unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been under way since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US until now.
An initial framework for the Agreement should be set at the end of this year.
This date is considered to be no longer durable.
Delicate Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
A flipchart, on which the shameful folk singer has recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with filthy pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells various places that he repeatedly records on the map, about which his minutely and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they originated and as it looks there, in his homeland.
Since then Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative wrongdoer.
With the in 2003 published and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", soundly composed songs appear, which are harmoniously close to American folk of the late 1960s but can at any time push into the great opulent.
It is the rumour that "Michigan" would be the first part of a promising series: each of the 50 US states should be consented in a row.
However, "Seven Swans" has already appeared in 2004 and in Rhine near, and it is positive to break some expectations.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live suffices him guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") a masterpiece on the surface will appear in 2005.
Exclusive to ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album rises to the American billboard charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic offsets.
This sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchestrated, but weed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
As long as the smaller clubs climbed, the stage shows will be here to be a colorful spectacle of Neon-Stirnbands and large fluorescent stagedeco.
Currently Sufjan Stevens tours as part of a five-head band by Germany.
Hamburger More kept in the dark!
Theatre presents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, Stevens, which has become much mature, returns to the intimacy and folk.
Without addressing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience one hears that the talk is "opulent" and that is why you could throw the "Platte basically" away.
First of all, Stevens is very modest, plays acousticly few older songs and finally denied under a great applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's DebÃ¼t at the time of the Prime Minister's question
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's DebÃ¼t has been expected with tension at the time of the Prime Minister's question
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is supposed to give his debut at the time of the Prime Minister's question and for the first time join David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will raise up to ask the first of his six prescribed questions shortly after noon, whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour Members from close.
He demanded "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Corbyn's leadership, since it comes to a member of the shadow cabinet after it was appointed and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chairman, during the singing of the National Hymne at a Memorial celebration on the 75th anniversary of Battle of Britain, has provoked criticism of a number of Tory-MPs on Tuesday, and is the center of several title-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn has drawn attention
A spokesman of Mr. Corbyn said that he had been "in respectful silence" and he recognized the "heldness of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle around England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the National Hymne, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they call on differences in the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stamping" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn said the TUC conference that Labour changes are in place to remove the whole idea of a limitation as a whole.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow-work and pension minister said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of Â£26,000 to Â£23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, David Cameron, who has been Tory Chief since he has been, over the dispatch box in Parliament last decade.
The Labour Chairman who promised another policy approach says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and more than 30,000 suggestions were given to him.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister's question is too confrontative and that he will be dismissed both "fairness" and the disputes with reverses and, instead, committed to focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker of the underhouse, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from the policy in the style of a "Kasperle theatre", which is often linked to the time of the prime minister's question. But a few years later he admitted that he failed in it.
Since it was first sent on television in 1990, the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the underhouse and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and need for extensive reforms.
'Schossen in Joburg: Obdachless youth trained photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a very hard place when you are homeless.
But a group of former roadchildren has found a way to learn skills and thus earn living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that informs homeless youths about how to take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from it.

Pounds increase by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose springingly by data showing an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom. At the same time, FTSE 100 was increased by the bidding goal SABMiller.
Between May and July, the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same previous period.
This percentage has been the fastest and estimated rate of interest increase since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and had climbed up to 0.84 % compared to the euro to â‚¬ 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index concluded with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition offer of the Rival AB InBev had received.
A transaction would combine the world's two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry-Actien, according to encouraging news from the Competition Group for Luxury Goods, increased Richemont 0.9%.
Richemont's latest sales figures are all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - remarked growth.
Glencore's shares rose by 5% after the mining series said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by selling shares as part of his strategy of debt reduction.
The shares of Mondi's packaging and paper group were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs' assessment for the company rating was "sale".
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half year.
The Chief of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion.
The Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs in his company, he says.
The cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: on Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappic 21 years young, a hanfling with upper shit.
The type with the platinum blonded hair is 100 million euros.
Even more.
Now is Monsieur Bieber in Berlin.
And the generation of U17 turns through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the polyns sit on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you have lived Idol, whose poster is hanging up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs as much as her Mama Ewa deserves half a year.
If ever.
She says, "My Wiktoria would have to sit in the gymnasium in the tenth class."
"I'll fill her a dream."
School obligation?
Who's yoking?
The fans aren't.
Neither beer itself.
He's got out of here.
For the advertising break of the Superbowl, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-Pickel company was rinsing many, many dollars on the beeber account.
And in every pop that looks like it and over the shop table, beetle also.
When Justin beaver drinks a coffee, you're amazed at the window table.
More than 100 million he was supposed to have exploited that way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that beeber was finally in the United States and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he's doing that.
Pegida plate brings libaneses to cardoffeldÃ¶ner-idee
Potatoes or darkeners?
It goes both in the CartoffeldÃ¶ner, which the Oldenburger imbis owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the word "Cartoffel instead of DÃ¶ner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay made potato and meat on a spit together.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Cartoffles instead of DÃ¶ner" that he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a barbecue is rotated in his shop, fitted with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Libanese Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the Authority, it has been recently protected as a model of use.
The amount of meat and the amount of potatoes of the sponge, Alhay does not want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary international understanding also comes well with its customers.
Metcash launches ground resistance campaign to fight Aldi
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA countries and sells shop owners, the approved tickets for the South Australian football liga to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler performs its annual investor strategy day for food, alcohol and equipment.
It's a lot at stake, since South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorious provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will remove about five percent of the food market in these two countries and remove all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, Analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year and $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and will achieve a sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash lost market shares in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and will reduce market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas's last week.
IGA's market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reductions with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler retires and invests more than $150 million to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and to provide a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash's main business leader Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and charging programs will be made to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is repeatedly called "Special Ks", went into the spotlight by the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon afterwards Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, and Harrison said: "Wawrinka had had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen how he broke a tennis beater after a cramp curtailed a potential US-open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in the competition with Sam Groth for the second place in a single place behind Bernard Tomic in Davis-Cup-Halbfinale against Britain.
"One thing I am quite experiencing is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was taken a little into the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a blower when he lost a shrub in the U.S. open, but he's not the first player who broke a bat of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has been extremely good in the US-open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too strictly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he's fitting into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's being respected in the clothing area, he trains hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves it to be judged according to his own earnings.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios in the important predecision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component."
"First, we want the team to be fully focused on competition and not on all the controversy around here," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has made the rise very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the public's eyes, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the Rampenlight, in which he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's the best for him.
Europe's Refugee Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and collapsed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to get into the country illegally. Everything with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants assembled in no country and Serbian officials responded with embarrassment.
The people who had fled from violence were found in an unknown time on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police helicopter swept over them, the migrants scanned "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian willing police.
Some returned from protested food and water.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary would be sent back, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbien) wants to be part of the solution and not a security damage.
There will be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulences at the Hungarian-Serbian border arrived one day after the 28-nation block at a conflicting meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy.
However, the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the overlapped Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that, at the end of the next month or the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU states would take up another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not hope for a short-term action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could lock roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
In the meantime, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans the construction of a stalk wire to Romania along its border to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ends a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were employed in the race to create the stalk wire zone between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past months, Hungary has become a significant narrow passport for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the entry point to the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has stated that most of the incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life, and not war refugees who have the right to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 meters (13 feet) high fence, which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia, a crime. These laws also impose higher penalties on condemned human dealers.
"On the basis of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the emergency state," said government speaker Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree in a process-technical way with the military being expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Advisor for Orban, said that when governments tried to cross the border, 45 people were already invading the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes according to the new laws.
Authorities are about to fix the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a train truck with stalk wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to enter it.
About 20 managed to come in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's advance before Bernie Sanders halfed in national survey
The former US Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit precursor in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her against the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic electors in the elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (ascent by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he has been candidateed for the presidential office, receives support of 15 percent of the democratic electors of the pre-elections.
More than five months before the beginning of the elections, most democratic electors say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates will support them.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News Survey Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained some gains.
Clinton holds a great advantage in women and moderates, but these incentives have reduced.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton's advantage for democratic electors under 50 years has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, has a great advantage among the older electors.
The last month Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-digit advantage with the liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage with this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the elections in the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
One quarter would support it with some reserves and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Maybe not surprisingly that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it enthusiasticly.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most frequent answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Its connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is also mentioned by Clinton's supporters.
Consent to deal with the problems and to choose is also cited.
Since the Vice-President throws a potential for the presidential office into the scale, 57 percent of the democratic electors of the elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it.
If democratic electors of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, bids are at the top.
About Clinton's followers say more than half that bids would be their second choice far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to candidate for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead is increased before Sanders, from 20 points with bids in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Five and fifty percent of democratic electors see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election, but this number of 78 percent has fallen in the last month.
Bidding is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees it as the "deselectablest" has risen.
Nevertheless, in the question of what is important in a candidate, democratic electors call questions about electorality.
Like last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these electors of the elections is inacceptable.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some important features of the elections of their party.
Many view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong management qualities.
Prayers are best cutting off at the three candidates in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of democratic electors do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not think of it.
In general, democratic electors also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in harmony with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked as Foreign Minister during the term of office, most democratic electors are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions as a whole.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one third is satisfied.
The public opinion for this was divided in March shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that her opinion was still deteriorating.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, saying that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by the electors of their party, this is still a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: Only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the constituents do not think they are a honest and trusted person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the country's electorate also see Trump as not honest and unreliable.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good notes in the tour.
From the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are best cutting off with honesty.
A majority sees Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson starts near Donald Trump at nationwide survey
Ben Carson is located at the latest CBS News/New York Times survey close to Donald Trump
The two candidates now have half of the support of the voters in the new survey, and others are dramatically losing hold
Republican electors continue to support Trump in a large number across the country. Support is growing from 23% in the last CBS survey carried out before Fox News debate last month, with 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The survey also revealed that Carson comes well with demographic groups and has exceeded Trump among Republican electors with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin's governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida senator Marco Rubio are located at the third place with 6%.
The error margin for the sample of 376 persons of Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was performed in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is increasing in the surveys - it lands at 19% support for the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a look at a carson ascending in the last week, Trump found some side hives for the former neurosurgeons, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Approach bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees hot.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, bathers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even hot water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some do not go to the sea anymore: The water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German weather service (DWD) shares.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic region it is 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College-Neuling
Almost two years after a student died in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, during a scary ritual, mortgage is filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Bruderschaft attacked Chun "Michael" Deng brutally during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police informed.
Officials said that he had been burdened with connected eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell consciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became innocent and supposedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothing, shake his symptoms, and Andy Meng to contact the national presidents of the brotherhood to get advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"On this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the well-being of the brotherhood on Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He couldn't be revised, and he died in his injuries the next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added to head, rumour and thigh injuries with stump force.
"Too many families were destroyed by the arbitrations of the brotherhood. At least one student dies every year since 1970 to the skicans," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family in an explanation.
Brotherhoods and their members must be taken to account, and this step by authorities is very important.
A county Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a claim for murder's third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-third members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of abusive attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We want to make not only the people involved responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has sanctioned this, we will also take them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its belonging to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
Interest increases are coming, and the houses will fall down, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will move into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history for the economy offers little guidance for the expiry.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressivity of the Federal Reserve when the interest rates are raised is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not concentrate on when they start to increase interest rates, but on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated because of an increase in interest.
"The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the "billy money," said Julian Jessop, Chief Econom at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights, but still at too low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to be afraid.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, the advancement of interest increases can make things volatil for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that assets revenues will be rejected 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank-Analysten in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in Fed.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase, rather flat in the 250 days afterwards (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Anlage-Stratege at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in an increase in the rate of Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 interest increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such fragile economic scenes could be risky and raise the question, "whether it is different this time," said the Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have made the whole year an interest increase in Fed, and all the eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many Strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the future trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all increase cycles took place from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing swiftness in GDP, and pre-recession heights have been shaded very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report states.
In contrast, this is a clear slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is far from the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatil, as the market is prematurely increasing, and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the yields seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/declining occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bonds are falling immediately, said the Deutsche Bank.
The Stratenders of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer collision of yields between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a deflation of the curve.
High-personal bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher earnings," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the Fed strengthens its strategy.
Overall, companies who develop the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from the increase in interest rates and the attractiveness of local products.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse, as an increase in dollars will cost their products on the global market and also finance their debts.
"The story shows that "quality" shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest increase," said Goldman Sachs Analysten in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have averaged 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality pendants by average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Businesses with a high share of flexible interest will lose most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Sparers could see profits through higher earnings, even if experts differ in opinion of how quickly that will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for his "dumb"
It argues that it is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
Parliament-College Damien Collins attacked the The Voice mission and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms" to Classic FM, claims a leading parliamentary member and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he does something that the private channels do not do.
The Conservative Deputy Andrew Bingham also told the BBC boss that the public-law radio station "damp" and increasingly no longer could be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dimble" - but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So, if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples, in which you actually only imitate what is already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director-General rejected the accusation and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public information.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will learn nowhere else about classical music.
And there is an engagement in live music and musicians, which is really unovertroffen.
"And to find new music from radio 3, and to order new works, I think it's really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it was harder to work to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of BBC production that, during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports, fireed the commercial rivals.
The Tory Deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated Â£22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly markant?
Lord Hall stated that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on special BBC-Weise".
He added that he wished that the company "found a hit from our own booth" next time it starts a conversation series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of other rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased slowly in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November retarded the expenditure
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the main shopping streets in the UK have turned into spirit cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 by only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are evidence that online sales are stagnating after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, it has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to operate with their mobile purchases.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different surroundings, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is pendant, and we may experience that growth is reduced.
The Black-Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is quoted as a reason for the dropping operations.
Experts believe that buyers hold their purchases before this event, which takes place on last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of buyers around their computers was sharpened five times, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers fought for bags, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that out of Â£5 spending was spending a little more than Â£ 1 online.
For some products such as television and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Moslems buried in Mekka at Crane accident Killed - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia places the collapse partially of the huge Saudi Bin Load Group to the burden
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were worn through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed at Mekka's grand mosque.
Grieving filled, largely dressed in white, the route to solve their respect when the first of the dead approached their last trip to the Al-Moaissem-Friedhof.
The mourning procession moved over at the Holy Place, where only days before a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the beatings.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the building company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left injured 394.
The bodies of 29 beasts who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque Mekkas were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the year's Hadsh in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly assured that the Haddsch will continue to Mekka with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when he was not used.
An Arab version of the Decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin Load Group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the News Agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was banned abroad.
At the beginning of this week praised Salman to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into an inner courtyard of the grand mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch, which later took place this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements on the collapse of Krans and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also rebuked the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Thousands of cranes surrounded Mekkas GroÃŸmoschee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Load Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arab family for decades and has taken over larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a deceased son, who was deprived of the family in the 1990s.
The crane crash came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (â‚¬ 174,000) should be paid to the members of the killed people and the same sum of permanently injured.
Other injuries receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen
This leads to the opening of 200 other screwfix loads targeted on craftsmen
At the same time Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales offices across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that British lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who perform the work in their home
If you can handle a hammer or a brush skilled to attract walls, you seem to be a minority today.
For British are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform homework jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
VÃ©ronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at lowest prices has now been overwhelmed.
Kingfisher therefore plans to open 200 more screwfix shops that are directed to craftsmen and to close 60 sales offices from B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women in the shop.
At the moment, the men are predominant with the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single houses that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We need to move this towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, one of five women at the top of a British leading company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including his management and financial management.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher indicated a decrease in half-year profit and sales after the group trained the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Functionary of Aich/Dob for disloyalty in court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, on Wednesday two functionaries of Austrian full-eyball vice-master Aich/Dob have to be responsible for disloyalty and tax retraining.
The accused did not recognize their guilty.
One of them had also been accused of official abuse.
He was pronounced in May by this pronunciation.
The current process has been deferred.
According to Oberstaatsanwalt Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the accused had been crystalized that in the years 2006 to 2011, the funds of club accounts which they were allowed to distribute in their functions were used for private purposes.
He pays the damage with about 400.000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial failure.
This fact expelled the Chairman of the SchÃ¶ffensenats, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
In order to reject the disloyalness, the defense indicated that the association had not created an asset disadvantage at any time.
The sports officials would only have charged expenses and would have excluded the debt to the sports club for which they had operated from 1982 to 2011 and where they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities were about 600,000 Schilling in 2001 (approx. 44,000 euros).
"By that time we were faced with the situation: do we continue to run the club or lock to the club?" said one of the accused, in the bread profession Grand Business Auditor of the Financial Office.
He then decided with his colleagues and fellow complaints to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have forgotten money, put our life insurance to the bank as a security," he said when he received.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, it must only not be made debts.
Furthermore, in the event of financial success, the payment of expenses had been retroactively decided by 1991.
Therefore, some of the expenses were paid out only years later, from 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, the former Obmann also appeared to explain the transactions.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments had not been made detailed to the association.
The association did not have an interest in the financial gesture in detail that only the freedom of debt had been important, so the answer.
In 2011, a amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account when it started against one of the functional investigations on official abuse.
These were backs, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and, according to its statement, was not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know an answer.
Then he finally thought he believed that this was the best for the association.
If something had happened to him, no one knew anything about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The complainant had been informed, the officer justified himself.
This transfer has been formulated as a "shadow recovery".
Why damages?, judge and attorney wanted to know.
The first accused said that he had not agreed with this form because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With this you are all out of the tailor."
"I am a legal representative?" he asked.
In addition, the official said that he never had a cent salary, he had calculated merely kilometres and diets.
He took into account the association 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Exact documents for the early years could not be presented by the defendants.
They were no longer kept after an operating examination, where everything had been judged correctly, they explained.
The second accused was also a mileage charge.
All surveys had been carried out in cash, he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he said.
The main proceedings will continue with the survey of witnesses on 23 September.
Hewlett-Packard stretches more 30,000 jobs
In addition to the loss of staff for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split up.
The place-slashes at the US-Computerries Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not end.
In the context of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to degrade from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its business customers savings.
This aims to save costs of $2.7 billion (2.4 billion) and notify the company on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars, which will attack from the fourth quarter.
The degradation of 55,000 jobs that have been running for three years has not yet been completed.
HP employed around 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
Afterwards, the Hewlett-Packard share reported 2.3 percent.
The Group, which is grown up with printers from the California Palo Alto, is currently divided into: Thus, computer and printer business are still to be bundled in a new society - separated from the more future areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business parts are to be recorded on the stock exchange.
A newly disappointing PC record as well as a weaker demand from business customers for its services recently increased to the world's second largest PC manufacturer in Lenovo.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the sales of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
The turnover fell by 8 percent to almost $25.4 billion.
This decreased in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a snippet and massive snippets.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only responded lately that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more shops online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total degradation of about 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority support the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in battles in Iraq would predominantly lead to rejection: 54 percent, on the other hand, claimed that 35 percent were consenting.
The fact that other states fly air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24 percent, on the other hand, are to intervene in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian captain Baschar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be.
29 percent could not decide.

RÃ¶szke: breach of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police has used tear gas and water lamps at the Serbian border with RÃ¶szke against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent DÃ¡niel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Thereafter, a police line had been formed, and behind the police, a water light was ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles after the officials.
The officials used pepper spray in the first place.
Afterward, the police used tear gas.
Many tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees are now waiting to withdraw something.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone.
Kids who had breathed the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees sailed together and suffered breathing.
The press speakers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US note bank
The world observes when the US note bank meets on Wednesday and Thursday on two days to make the important decision, whether the interest is raised for the first time for almost a decade or not.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half, which was still the last week of the view that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will continue a little longer and keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event, because it's seven years ago, since the Fed interest has set on NULL.
"For the first time, we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Heading Staff at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good performance level, billion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rose view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to stop an increase, but the signs indicate that the opportunities against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20.00 MEZ
Death protector at the Delta State University left excuse letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it was "pleading" at the first murder and wanted, "he could make it shake," announced authorities on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science at Delta State University, called the emergency call number by 10:00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot somebody and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will disturb," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb didn't explain his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when policemen surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, which Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" for a "driven relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolute best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, met with lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "he's not going to prison."
When police took him on the highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the forest, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his lifelaue indicates on the University's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky donors
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressy years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor is also supposed to fight with drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug possession.
All of this certainly demands his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the Group
The Lufthansa plans a large group construction.
A half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group alone wants to save with a better organization.
150 of around 1000 leaders worldwide will cost the company's construction of the workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot work.
Lufthansa rebuilds its business structure and evaluates Eurowings' low-cost subsidiary.
The aim of the reorientation is to provide a contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline notified on Wednesday.
Among other things, there will be no more board at Lufthansa in the future for the passenger business.
Eurowings is intended to develop as independently as possible.
In the board team of Chief Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
With the recast, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group will continue to respond to Ryanair and Easyjet.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex.
The airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Airlines Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the Cockpit (VC) pilot association, the negotiations are to be resumed after the strike stopped by the court on Thursday.
That told the union.
The topic of the discussions should be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants "in a year with a predicted record result" to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible.
The conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the spare concept is "Wings".
It provides that Lufthansa is exposing routes to Eurowings in the fight against competitors to the company's own billing line.
Under the title "Morgenzug in den SÃ¼den" are paintings of Leena KrÃ¼ger in the artist's house.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League deposit at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left foreign defendant to wine and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The injuries were caused by a cautious attack by HÃ©ctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very difficult and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
He had a oxygen mask in the envelope cabin.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the hanging of an elephant.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had been misled.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an ivmeter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account was, "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to recovery starts now, I come back stronger."
In this regard, Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the United Kingdom defendant has an additional incentive to recover until the next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the place with this type of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played Holland against Van Gaals at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very bad injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
It wasn't possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was traveling in another direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard that can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player AndrÃ©s Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost outward.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to call his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental faculty published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss, decided.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Happy, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
Everything beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to describe the action of the book, represents instead an indication of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the embraced town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a goods, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seus's Geisel and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this would not be suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron is partly like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database, which begins: "In the embraced city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a goods, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the act of the book. Here a unnamed boy hears, as the local environment falling through the money-great, trees, Thneed twisting once-ler, despite the protests of the name-catching Lorax, a hooking, snurrying being, "that speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times after each other.
A Downing Street spokesman said that the text was probably coming from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees but didn't give any further comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To strike Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the box that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series deposit is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outward victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting design, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars of 2012, only a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth separates from the England test chamber and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult to analyze for me as his chief trainer in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to nomination, because - and I said this earlier - players are their best choices.
Long ago, the course of Lyth had been extended, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he hopes he's gonna run out further runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not make such good performances, and that doesn't surprise me; he is especially a team man.
The question of how much time a test striker gets to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only accusation that you can raise was that England first introduced Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a beating man I appreciate very much.
He's a X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early in this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
It must at least get the same opportunities as before it, but this depends of course on the team design in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beside Cook beat what would produce an extra spin bowler and receive four quicks appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a beating man can't beat there, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's a devil ceremony of Cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealing with him, he very impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the beater and 35 with the ball - and think it is a point, but there are no large number of backup spinners that lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some wise additions to the trainer's staircase.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game who will bring a lot of experience because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dress cabin, even if the news are in line with the previous said.
Collys team colleague at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team writers do not determine the schedule.
And you need to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly in heart.
The Brexit-Lager (Brexit = United Kingdom exits from the EU) could gain access if the economy is swinging into a fleet by 2017
David Cameron's unextended new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be more difficult every day, even without the choice of the genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is severely crushed by Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend has recently said that some Member States, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always out of their own debt, are satisfied with the United Kingdom's own agenda with divided concessions and disturbing contract changes which they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided on their annual meeting that it does not like it, even if it threatens social protection.
We could also call Dave and George's Selfie-Agenda.
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes an outlook UK inside the EU centre - "Don't let us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have come to the point where it doesn't matter whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautious prosecutor Angela Merkel is an alliest, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it has happened to the exaggerated long endurances such as Thatcher (11 years), midrand (14) and coal (16).
France's FranÃ§ois Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a burning force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will get out of a leg to help the selfie bribes whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may intentionally not even plan helpful remarks, quite in the SNP style, while the UK referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renewal was a pleite" and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renewal."
The Europeans know how presumptuous Fleet Street can be at its expense and what EU scepticians are the oligarry of the press barones, as it was not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can not remember Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunists who made a name as a "EU-Garden Bananas" Brussels Correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his crazyness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among these were the Medley of tax-fearing horrors, telephone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-industrians who have most of our large newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but noted that when you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of being at lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself as he opposed Cameron's referendum wire, because Blair had put the principle of the unaccepted constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch electors in 2005, which opened him a back door.
The press has never forgotten him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly clap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs time to waste for me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnock's Boykott Murdoch's strategy of the 80s, an error at the time and today.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is in the development - I would say it kindly.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue colouring tendency and the wilder floods of Tory's small englandism can probably say yes.
It is what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn in the radio and television this week when the pathfinder in him did not admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as a shadow cancer was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinjob.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his competitors and Members after all reports at their clause session on Monday evening.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the scrutiny of social media, a breeding place of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to not give Cameron a free map for Europe, which allows him to think Labour support in the Referendum campaign for a self-evidence, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins sure thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic multipliedness of EU membership - in line with their bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the esoteric discussion among left dissidents for which the narcissmus of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its multiplied ideas on the Nato - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC does not start a campaign for exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious electors - to make consents to the British if all of this can be meaningless?
The USA are already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of when I started on Monday, what was called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise report by Public Health England on E-cygarettes
State-financed agency claims that e-cygarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 persons, partly connected to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who wrote in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cygarettes.
PHE published the basic report last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the burdenability of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "exceptly windy basis" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor for Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects the claim of PHE that "the present best estimate is that e-cygarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were invited to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision-making analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) in order to lead their opinions on the damages of different nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose manager should have previously received by British American Tobacco Mittel (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they should receive funds from an e-cygarette manufacturer, but not the financing which he should have received according to reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the members of the body are not provided, but there are several known e-cygarette champions, some of which also indicate an industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in PHE's tobacco management.
The research work of the group "below that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products at most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "it does not give any evidence that e-cygarettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non-smoking."
Prof. Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded before.
He said, "E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies in his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cygarettes are low in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year.
By the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cygarettes are not riskless, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnder and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC that they would be placed in hardly controversial windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried without success to contact the BBC for six years at Channel 4.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC's programs are commissioned or sent, which would also clearly be shown by non-subventioned rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communication Committee in his investigation of the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think in the medium or long term is a good idea, you should at least make your production on programmes that do not make or commission others.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve as wide as possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnder is another, admittedly both own productions.
In fact, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don't think this would actually reduce the BBC.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is responsible for hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnder.
Johnson said that the rather public-legislative niche programs should "go to BBC4, where you can't measure quite the audience, but they fulfil their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their hypocritical missions for justification of Â£4 billion, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window where no one ever wanted to see her.
Johnson said to the committee: "I ask you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, I wonder if that's right, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5-Chef David Elstein, who also said before the Committee on Tuesday, asked the BBC to check their Rithian mission to "form, form and entertain".
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and she should take an example of changing this in "informing, informing and entertaining" to the public television channels in Australia and Canada.
On the question of the partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, of which he said that only one handful is shown on television, and go into alliances with the commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the Nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are radiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have breeded worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are radiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by activating Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More about this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Screekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to Guardian that one day the process could replace deep-hering stimulation, an invasive process that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson disease.
Fadeworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasonic waves, which then enter into the worms.
The intensified ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves create the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to, according to a Nature Communications report.
In order to create ultrasound controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of their motoneurones carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When using ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are strengthened by the microblows and transferred to the worms where they turn on the modified motoneurones.
The process has made some similarities with optogenetics, a tram breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages about this technology.
In contrast to light that must be sent down at an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound wave tissues can be unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical attitude for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The advertisements are ashamed of Britain's arms trade
View Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen-Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Footer gels crushing leg barrels!
Streubombs!
And electric shock sticks that cause pain, but don't leave a trace!
The cheerful voice and the cartoon pictures make no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest weapons fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the British government's willingness to shrink weapons on repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and require a second view.
"Well announcement: Drive with DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the writing types of the London Underground and the brand mark of the DLR line, which turns to the image of a tank.
In September a swarm of arms dealers will drive with DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum for Grey Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped to distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a Â£6 package of Inbuskeys, which claims that "access to about a third of the bus stop advertising surfaces on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parodic displays produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists are working with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to move outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-waffen trading plates greets the pendlers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100.000 times over Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertisement agency, which works beneficially with the graphician and Voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence that ruled around the advertising for the arms fair - through an empty place of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "We give them the campaign that tried to avoid them."
They played with the invention of a more realistic silent business advertisement, but "by blooming with bright colors and animation it remains more liable."
"They have made a fantastic job by helping us to sharpen the consciousness of the sale of illegal torture devices on the fair," says Tom Davies von Amnesty.
What we need now is an entering of the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not illegally acted before our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors scorn fantastic euphemist products.
In a press release Saab reveals an order from the US Army on "the AT4CS RS shot by the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped fighting head, which delivers outstanding impacts within the target."
Whatever that causes, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still in the faith of Berets and Moral Relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I have annoyed - and the numerous long - breathing complaints about others.
Most of the things I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely alarming.
It's appealing to swim: tell people where you come from, whether and where you took Sabbath year, where you're standing with regard to Corbyn and why you're "Veryly saying Marmite don't love or hate, because in seriousness, boys, it's just a hefe extract HAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't speak to, even if your wimpers were burned and those fire extinguishers were.
Let people.
The rooms of people are often transformed into beverage receptions, film night events and local meeting points, but they are also the places in which people attract themselves and reverse their underwear.
In this regard, don't think about starting at the university with a relationship
Introverted receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a room-to-room bombing culture that can lead to lifelong friendship.
That can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a commune is exhausted from sociality - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Attack: Do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that a unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
As you start the university at the highlight of the back mania, the clapping at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of Brownies is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Willkommen in the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions."
Offering homemade eggs is a good way to close friends.
Their cousin feels obliged to talk and maybe at the end associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed clumps of flour, sugar, and fat lead people to sleep when you knock on.
The stealing of food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clue of chicken is a thiefstone, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, this is angry, and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my co-inhabitant who added a dishwasher to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleep or from work.
It is not only about being a decent person, but that you are among the people sitting in the glass house in the trueest sense of the word.
A girl on my hall asked her neighbors if they were a bit quieter to put Drum & Bass, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
Finally, when they stopped at 5 a.m., she friendlyly left her neighbors to sleep two hours before she let her own music plair, closed her door and went to her three - hour trial.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would move in to the same student home?
In turn, it would not be absurdly embarrassing if you hold a fellow dweller for your future spouse, turn to them, separate them, and then see them every day and maybe experience how they cross all the common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot co-inclusive person is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk a little reason to your submarine.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has let his keys lie in his unlocked room, the border between a Ulk and Mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good string is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes Bumerang.
By hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but never spare anyone's room with dental pasta and shampoo.
Close your door, and place their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer â€“ but don't touch their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Serial houses for refugees, single parent, low service providers
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds series houses in the middle-franky corner Valley for people who don't have much money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the only nursing mother and the low minister."
"I show how to build well and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview.
Thousands of refugees will push on the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheap living space can be created: It builds series houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or tour halls has no sustainability.
For people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the refugee flow, we also need sufficient living space in the next decades.
A whole banal, three-storey row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least place.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when people are in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses, which are just built in the pilot project, consists of three housing units for four asylum applicants each.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's again peace, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square metres per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's overlookable.
Six months have lasted the construction.
This is appropriate.
Did the construction rules complicate their plans?
Gildner: I corrected my project.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damocles difficult to construct specially and the parking regulation.
Wrong.
It is still undercover who creates three apartments in a row house, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities there is no place for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents respond to their series house project?
Gildner: There were some who suggested me to create luxury buildings for asylum applicants.
What definitely is wrong.
But do you not intensify the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True is: We have had a building tree in Germany in the last five years, but we have been built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, also the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the only nursing mother or the lowest minister.
I'm showing how you can still build favorably and well today.
That's what's going on.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first studied environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, typing on "general" and then choosing "software update".
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, as they get an error message that tells that the "software update failed".
To avoid the problem, users are recommended to wait either until the storm goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it unlikely by clanking the update. Similarly, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is finished.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charging device, so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half-way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update.

You should also make sure that before you download, you have looked through our checklist of all things to prevent things from running wrong and protecting themselves if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only devise: Full Attack
In the fight for the World Cup titles in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton, he knows only one more devise: "Full Attacke".
The second WM emphasized before the start into the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose anymore".
53 points separate the vice world champion before the separation in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two-fold champion Hamilton.
The British already won seven of the previous twelve season races and also attacked the flood light-grand-Prix in the city state as a favorite.
2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British could win the race.
Whether the current Smog in the city state will influence the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear.
For days a dark bell has been hanging over the city, caused by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen" was founded three months ago, and another member in his series was added to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a member of the Federal Cross of Conservation 1. Class and honour citizens of the cities of Espelkamp and LÃ¼bbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen supported Gauselmann with a donation which took president Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to record chess players who cannot contribute to membership.
Youth work and talent search will also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership of the chess club and also friendly contact with the "Rot-WeiÃŸ" tennis club will be seen as an expression of his association with the Kurstadt.
Quarter Office is looking for direct contact
Saludes and the Old Center of Antonistift have joined together under the coat of the social foundation and a new starting point has been opened at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city center.
More precisely, at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
There was recently a new quarterly office opened.
Here, right next to the shopping market, the elderly and consultants will receive information on questions such as care insurance or health insurance services.
For years, with our ambulant care service, we have found that often nursing family members are left alone.
There are infinite questions.
"Even rarely, many of the cash services are not used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new houselord Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antony Foundation and the Civil Hospital as well as for the ambulant service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new Quarter Office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as Sturz prevention, memory training or physiotherapy treatment.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis are ideally complemented.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and reha.
Heke Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis, described "The Senior Centre for Care and Care".
The reason for the opening of the new quarterly office in the city centre is that both managers are particularly viewed in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the various districts of Bamberg in the future essential.
In addition, mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined the inauguration celebrations, the Quarter Office also devoted itself to the association at age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite them to a regular gathering".
This makes the social foundation a big contribution that seniors can live as self-employed and well in their trusted environment as possible.
The Quarter Office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o'clock, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o'clock and Saturdays from 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock.
Eintracht Bamberg against WÃ¼rzburger Kickers on October 6th
Now it is official: After the appointment for the FC Eintracht Bamberg game has not yet been established for rehabilitation work at the Fuchspark Stadium against the third liability of WÃ¼rzburger Kickers, 6 October was now set as an appointment.
The encounter of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth finale of the Bavarian football Totopokals against the third-ligist FC WÃ¼rzburger Kickers has now been finalised.
Played on Tuesday, October 6th, at the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium.
"We are happy that we now know when the game goes over the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz HÃ¼mmer, who also points to the now started card pre-sale.
It's a special thing for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and this is not without reason, because flood light games have a special attraction.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg in 2010 moved through victory to the districtligist 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regionalligists 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives EUR 5000 and qualifies for the first round of the DFB club pocal 2016/2017.
The title defendant is SpVgg Unterhaching third-party offspringer.
Wiener Architekt Karl Mang 92-year-old died
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5, at the age of 92, as the artist's house reported on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied Architecture at the Technical University in Vienna during and after World War II at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but he was also a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was the president of the Austrian Institute of Formation.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the Austrian Theatermuseum with the establishment of the Treasury in the Hofburg of Vienna and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws police with money
Ex-Footballer Tim Wiese has unfairly noticed in Bremen.
Soccer was once, Tim Wiese, ex-national guard in Germany and Bremen and Hoffenheim is now engaged, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have added in the past two years, according to his own statement.
On the other hand, intellectually, he hasn't admitted.
Wiese was able to cut the hair in the centre of Bremer just when he saw an outside parking room guard a wardrobe for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
After that, Wiese crashed out of the business, insulted the officer and threw her the due money penalty in front of her feet, as the "Image" magazine reports.
At the city of Bremen one confirms the accusations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still in the test," says it of the city of Bremen.
Only afterwards is decided whether weeds are shown or not.
Authorities of Panama destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-typical climate of Isla del Rey are best suited for the enjoyment of the marijuana plants.
For three days, Panama's authorities have poured out the 4500 plants and burned them.
Men plead on 17-year-old Afghan
Witnesses are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-SalmÃ¼nster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden in the direction of SalmÃ¼nster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, according to the police, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the Bft tank station.
On the grounds of the tank station, three people also stayed.
One of these men now cried to the youth and struck this with the fist into the face.
The victim suffered a nose breach and bleeded strongly from the nose.
When his two friends hurled down and shamefully talked to the batter, he first left his sacrifice.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and was demonstratively passing there several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the batter and another male person.
In addition to a stabstock, the victimâ€™s face and thighs were plucked.
The injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
So far there is only a vague description of the offender.
One of the men was about 1,80 meters.
The second slander was supposed to have been about 1,65 meters and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and notifiers to report under the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongoll and Frank MÃ¼ller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
In addition, Samtcome Mayor Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf mayor Heinfried Kabbert are pleased.
In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf is lucky: Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still at the side of his successor in the next few months.
After a reconstruction phase, MÃ¼ller reopens the practice on October 12, until then he invests 310000 euros in the rooms on St.-MarcellusstraÃŸe 6.
It was sympathy at the first glance when the Felstehausens of years ago, Frank MÃ¼ller and his wife, Dr. Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongoll, met with her doctoral training in the Verden Hospital and wanted to get into practice next year.
"We always had in the back that the MÃ¼llers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laugh.
"When it was so far, I just called her."
The couple of MÃ¼ller enjoyed the idea of conducting their own practice in Asendorf.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old MÃ¼ller.
"We want to get to know the families over the years and accompany them."
He also sees as the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the MÃ¼ller bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two-fold family father Frank MÃ¼ller also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctoral practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently a senior doctor in Sulingen, and he has been appointed a leading note doctor in the Diepholz district in 2009 and is engaged in the DRK factory Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a household doctor, his Gattin Ursel (Internistin) specialized in gastroenterology.
The MÃ¼llers, both internists, want to stay as a house doctor.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says the 38-year-old Silvia MÃ¼ller Gongoll.
After the conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound investigations as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a talk room more.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total allowance of 50000 euros will be granted to the MÃ¼llers as part of a support programme from the county (25000 euros) as well as from the Samt Community (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued," emphasizes Samt community citizen Bernd Bormann.
Some 2000 patients, according to Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongoll, come into the practice of Felstehausen each quarter, in the North German average practice there are about 500.
There is another doctoral practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practical acquisition by Frank MÃ¼ller: The pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had found her, she would have gone.
By the way, those who visit MÃ¼ller's speaker hour continue to look mainly in familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their departure, a era ends in Asendorf, however, the physicians have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen.
A little wrath already feels them after the long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients often," says the internist.
Your husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000 square metre base."
"Bisher I've always pushed myself before gardening, now this could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandsons and they like to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees through"
"Now border controls will also be driven up at our southern border," said interior minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum bid could also make this "of course".
The supply and safety of people are at the forefront.
But be sure, "that it needs clear signals," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration streams, even over the Austrian-Slovenic border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "Korridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also establish corridors for refugees.
However, this interior minister Vesna GyÃ¶rkÃ¶s Znidar did not see in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely inacceptable", Slovenia will, in particular, intensify border surveillance - to Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia has already been strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister pointed out, Slovenia does not want to dissolve its limits for refugees.
"Every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed GyÃ¶rkÃ¶s Znidar.
As the Croatian government noted, the first refugees had already tried to pass in East Croatia at the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid in the nighttime to avoid registration.
The Croatian police could pick her up in the nearby maize fields.
According to local media, police vehicles have been constantly in the Croatian Tovarnik with new refugees since then.
It is mainly Syrian and Afghan, including many women and children.
Also, rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days his country counted with about 4000 refugees, said Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported consistently on Wednesday.
However, the Government in Belgrade argues that it is the people's direction to take certain routes: "We can neither do this nor want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border city of Sid had arrived in the early days, further buses would be expected over the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates were travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has made it, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue traveling to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to the shift of the previous Balkan route to Turkey-Greece Macedonia-Serbien-Hungary to a slightly further western route for observers.
Croatia: "Total possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Foreign Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong flow of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as non-Schengen member has "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, and the EU partners have been giving the country a good witness since then, as far as the standard of border controls is concerned.
On Serbian side, about 300 refugees continue to be found behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they would have spent last night on the Horgos crossing, which leads to RÃ¶szke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely locked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian interior minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down Wednesday early at a local bill in Horgos: he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
At present, it would not be very high refugee numbers.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers recommend migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to refugees maps on which alternative routes are recorded by Croatia.
However, the crossing of borders between Serbia and Croatia is not cautious: in parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, mining fields still unclean.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners in the border region was sent.
Exchange hacker: Ukrainer pays 30 million dollars
Supranonok was supposed to have heard of a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of having been insighted into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
Insider businesses in the financial markets are intended to have been made with the utilized information.
According to the researchers, in this way, more than $100 million were exaggerated.
"The present comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are finally caught," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 other accused in the case lasted.
Most of the accused came from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are supposed to have acted from both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenic Hospice Help Mannheim has been present for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz, there is a heavy operation.
People are doing their concerns, partly fast steps, partly cozy bubbling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at the Paradeplatz.
Hold city trams.
Pulsating, splendid life at magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle four large tablets each with the title "Before I want to die"....
The ecumenical Hospice Assistance made this action aware of its 20-year-old existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went to the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the ecumenical Hospice Assistance is available to the passers for questions and discussions as well as the honorary staff.
While some people spontaneously take a passer to the creide and have the sentence to "believe my life", "read," "leave the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "not long suffer," others remain short, read sentences like "I am not yet far" and then continue.
At the outset, small discussions about the action in itself, about life, dealing with dying.
Peter HÃ¼binger is also on site.
"Only if I make it clear that the end of this world will come for me some time, I can live responsible," says the director of the diaconical work Mannheim, who is jointly the Caritas association of the ecumenical Hospice Assistance.
Therefore, this publicly effective action for the 20-year-olds is good.
That not everyone wants to share publicly on the tables, however, is understandable, finally it is a very personal thing.
The theme of death and death is still covered by Tabus, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospic movement has contributed much to the opening of people in recent years.
An estimate that shares Angelika Godephroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the honorable staff of the first hour.
Through personal experience confronted with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the death aid.
When the ecumenical hospice aid was looking for honorary officials, she immediately reported himself and had been involved in the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid is one of a team of 45 honorable - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the affected person and family in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospice of Sankt Vincent.
They're all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and experiences and experiences.
"I see life from another wait, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of confession.
The financial support of the hospitals and donations of relatives and associations enables training and training and supervision of the death and grief companions.
Every two years, training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial perspectives lowered for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier giant reduced its profit outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that she plans to attend about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company wanted to stop 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year, which ends in May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected a survey of FactSet $10.84.
In spite of price increases, the lower prospects are 4.9 percent on 4 January, and despite higher surpluses for land transport of heavy and large packages collected from November.
The company said that it still expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "brings solid yields when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the UPS Rival, which intends to cancel 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which foretold twelve analysts surveyed by Zack's Investment Research.
sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has declined in international priority shipment, which brought sales to the stagnation of express shipments in its unit.
But the tree in the online shop has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport sales increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express Unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they lost 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record height on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Stratente spends two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table sitting to decide whether it is time for the first time to raise the lead interest for almost a decade.
Threatening over them at an end of the decorated two-storey session hall is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and its colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a two-fold mission from the Congress: maximising US employment and maintaining prices here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predicting them. It is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start to be sponsored by the unprecedented incentive by the short-term interest rate close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most data of the economy show that it grows solidly, the recent turbulences in the global financial markets could scare the already careful Fed representatives to increase this volatility by increasing the rate of federal bonds - and it is also only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economics at the Makler Company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself impairs the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect to wait for the Fed, with a key indicator, which indicates only a 30% chance to increase.
This suggests a fall in the share market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the Strategens calm down the impact by promised that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average ran by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chief Ecoconom at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the sentences at this time," he said.
If she does, "they must go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Another month ago, the Fed seemed good to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points in this month, the first small step in a slow intensification of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected to increase the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the Fed considers to be full employment.
wage increases have shown signs of recreation.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and need them because of the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Ecoconom at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets across the world were collapsed in the end of last month after China had evaluated its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May when investors feared that slowing the Chinese economy would diminish global growth.
The market has recovered something this month, while the Dow is now almost 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulences affect complex calculations when to increase interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the twist during this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. note bank staff.
Now he foretells that she will wait at least one month to get better control of the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the final effect, the Fed Monetary Authority has become the world.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "reverse" its monetary expansion, caused confusions around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, the Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to improve understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the assets management of the company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements which seem not linked to economic fundamental data."
Lacker, voting-righted member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is engaged in an increase in interest, has been quoted as an example in 1998/1999.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its direct interest by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "between limited recognisable effects on growth in the USA", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives reverted these reductions.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as market breakdown in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Interests Committee.
The recent turbulences are not near this level, he said.
"It certainly does not want to get into the situation in which it is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are excited," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until this is changed, I do not think it should hurry out of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/the warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often called Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market, which is also sold to the public.
Yes, he is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/the warehouse is a central starting point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to swallow through the slopes.
If the whole shopping shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garlic (good and priced) in this shop is close to the cabinets and has various take-up options.
What is there here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are priced and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat towel is extensive, as well as the fish towels - the staff behind the theke will clean and file the fish and even breed for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and galaxy, pig natural arms, fish bells, regional worst, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cooks, also individual families and individuals.
The wide ranges are suitable for shopping carts and fork trailers.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city center - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To prepare you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless honorary helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still enjoys teaching with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she's doing it at the asylum applicant home on the Dillinger Street.
There it helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a right school.
Brazilâ€™s paediatric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tries to explain women in a shocking way about how important good diet is during breastfeeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking to breasts painted with illustrations of unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calorie consumption is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The Bernried municipal council approved the construction request for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flat for solar system.
The plans for long-looking tour hall construction at Bernrieder SportsgelÃ¤nde are step-by-step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the workout application was sung unambiguously without major discussions.
Previously, the Board had decided, among other things, an application for a building legal "exception" respective "freedom" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" concerned the permit for a special form of roof construction.
Accordingly, a "Sattle roof with a non-century first and roof overlay" will be built.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants: "Thereby we get a wonderfully large southern roof together," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In turn, the "freedom" concerns the roof inclination, which is intended to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons, unlike the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "freedom" was therefore needed because the construction plan does not allow "excepts" to be "excepts" in respect of rooflines - whereby the Bernrieder municipal council usually treats restrictively in case of requests for exemption.
However, this is not a recurrent project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Costs are estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Subsidies are expected from the promotion of school and latitude sports.
In the next stage of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Landratsamt for examination.
Klinik PeiÃŸenberg moves to Schongau
The PeiÃŸenberg Hospital is supposed to be closed earlier than planned - 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new doctoral director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of employees move from PeiÃŸenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which land council Andrea Jochner-WeiÃŸ confirmed.
However, a decision on this is taken by the Supervisory Board, and it will be held on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the almost 50 employees at the PeiÃŸenberg hospital would be further employed.
The predominant majority should move with fishermen and the remaining internal station to Schongau.
The rooms are available.
Employees who cannot be able to work after Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-WeiÃŸ.
The staff were informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a doctoral director of the Schongau hospital since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice near the hospital.
When questioning who should follow, Jochner-WeiÃŸ, the name "Fischer" came into the game, who declared himself ready to take over the lead from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in every case a "evaluation" and a dissemination of the offer in the field of "Innere Medicine", says Jochner-WeiÃŸ.
Fischer is a specialist for heart stepmakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the interior station.
As for the next two years, if the Supervisory Board agrees, fishermen will be definitively closed in PeiÃŸenberg after almost 140 years, until next year, the former hospital of the Craft, which still has 35 beds, will be closed.
To date, the district had planned this for 2018 when the current rehabilitation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landlord Jochner-WeiÃŸ, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, encountered rumors that the house, which is owned by the Bundesknapping, will be used as a accommodation for asylum mowers in the future.
"I quit this." As the property continues, Jochner-WeiÃŸ could not say there are several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatrie.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again," said Fischer about the quasi move to the Lech, which had been recorded by the employees "positively and very comprehensible".
A real perspective for the house in which fishermen have worked as a chief doctor for over 30 years has not been present.
He had been asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the posts of the medical director.
The PeiÃŸenberg Hospital (one 100 beds) was repeatedly threatened by closure over the past decades, departments were closed, for example surgery and birth aid.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar LÃ¶wen are required at the Bergische HC tonight (20.15 o'clock).
Although the leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, there is no cause for superbness.
During the last season, the Badener had a painful defeat at the BHC and had something to do there.
Hunting accident with two injuries at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured by shots during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Abertens on a Maisfeld near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shot, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals.
Just how the accident could happen was first unclear.
Criminal police detection.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violence crime
One suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-olds missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the hearing, the 20-year-old admitted that young people killed and thrown their body into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old man from Rhineland-Palatinate has been victimized by a crime since Saturday.
The body of the young woman was found in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, as public prosecutor and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, also arrested on Tuesday evening, is suspicious to the fact that the act was stated and that the intermitters led to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after visiting a autumn festival in Rockenhausen on the eve.
When looking for the young woman, the investigators first found personal objects of the victim.
Finally, in surveys in the group of friends and acquaintances of the missing people, a suspicion of the 20-year-olds appeared.
The suspicious offender then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the arrested party, the authorities admitted in the police trial that the 16-year-olds killed and put the body into the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the prisoner on Wednesday, the investigators put him to the burden of death.
Further investigations are to be made in the light of the closer circumstances of the action.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns about housing
The location on the German housing market is excited.
More and more refugees are also looking for an affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market grows.
Social housing is faced with a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing to a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with income weak citizens for the last affordable apartments.
To cover the demand for affordable apartments, 400.000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
This results in a study on behalf of the Association Association "Social housing".
Comparison: This year, 260,000 units are finished in Germany.
That's why 140,000 apartments are missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live as an asylum seeker in a first survey accommodation after the first three months of their stay.
Many then hit the housing market and get into the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, last year less than half of all asylum applicants lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also constitutes significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany appears to be a deficit of apartments, which grows from year to year.
At present, some 770,000 residential units were already missing in the Balling Areas, Matthias GÃ¼nther, author of the study.
Many professionals, therefore, lived in major cities in WG rooms.
Young adults remained unwillingly longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the fleet on the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per head has been reduced for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the "Social housing" alliance proposes a reboot.
New incentives are aimed at rebuilding social housing.
This could lead to abolishing the basic labour tax and a temporary exposure to the basic tax on funded housing.
Furthermore, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The support programme for refugee accommodations of the Staatsbank KfW is now being well addressed in cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been charged on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have led freely: Croatia and Slovenia address corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no passion anymore, as more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia.
Zagreb announces that the passing through Slovenia to the north without barriers.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to understand with the neighbouring country Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I talked to the Slovenian interior minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the abolition of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to reach western Europe from there.
500 people had reached the border with Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had closed his border for refugees on the day before.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning.
Most of the media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and taxes to the Serbian border city of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not strike borders.
For this, the border straps present other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mines cleaners are now supposed to quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the closure of the border, there are little more refugees after Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police numbered 366 attacked people.
Shortly before the end of the door on Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws take into account the overlap and damage of the border zone as a crime.
Thus, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The condemned are threatening prison sentences up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the newly established "Transitzons" on Tuesday, of which almost all - 93 - were the most important transition to RÃ¶szke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have stopped there.
But in practice no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The refused asylum seekers are to be deferred there.
Before the "transit zone" in RÃ¶szke, only a few hundred refugees were gathered.
Workers started cleaning up in RÃ¶szke.
They gathered the garbage that had left tens of thousands of people on the roadside in the past weeks.
Lock grids were dismantled and one of the recording camps was rebuilt in the border area.
To the end of this transformation, nobody wanted to express himself.
Austria only reach few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants, however, remained in the country according to government information.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instruction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot.
Mayor rided "Gastendete" over the border
"After the bridge festival on Sunday, we were busy cleaning up when suddenly ten people with travel suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," says Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped railways with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee current, it was in Wernstein's final", said Stadler, who immediately offered his assistance and chauffled the Gastands together with two other helpers and their cars over the border to the Near Passau.
Previously, we have once fought the unforgettable guests, with jause and drinks.
We just said we've brought them to Passau with the car.
"This was obvious for us," said Stadler in the OÃ–N talk.
They were very grateful.
A man couldn't take it to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the firearm.
"We were very happy to do this," says Stadler.
On Sunday evening, the skilled train passengers in Wels had moved from a ICE to a regional train towards Passau to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that railways were stopped to Germany.
However, the regional train was placed before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the crossing of borders is generally high in course.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, a two-bridge race sporty day before â€“ organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor OrbÃ¡n now sends more Zigtausends to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping immediately in the camp RÃ¶szke to create structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has made the attitude of the Hungarian government in the dark circle of national socialism publicly and highly officially.
This policy is not only those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "glowed country" which she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge to create humanitarian conditions for seekers in view of the persistent flows of refugees and the coming winter.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter festivals
Konrad has all the hands to do with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen-Banker to set up quartets for thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording centre of Traiskirchen has already been handled by Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless in Traiskirchen," he reported his first success.
Also, the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without a big spine, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
On the other hand, the Ministry of Interior spoke of a "crisensitive situation".
Overall, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quartets in the year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations will have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 are to provide countries, 15,000 of the covenant.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil," Konrad said.
He has already talked with the heads of the country.
They would have assured him to create quartets for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it works well," Ferry Maier said.
The former VP-mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow, there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph SchÃ¶nborn, to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action "Halfen wie wir".
On the platform, private persons can offer uncomplicated accommodations.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Conrad and Maier criticized the standards for the accommodation as "very high" yesterday.
In emergency times it may not be that quartier publishers have to maintain a certain height of the towel holders or size of the upper lights.
"Note standards" should apply for a time-limited period.
The fact that he was more successful in housing, in contrast to the Ministry of Interior, was founded by Konrad with his experience.
I am an older Lord to whom one does not say in the face the intrusion.
Convincing power is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves explained.
Their number of employees want to increase them to three to four.
Your own quartier search has not been successful yet.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there seems to be problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
No opening urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for Refugees planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as one could presently be able to place the persons concerned without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further locations should be checked for their fitness.
The head of the city is criticizing the division of refugees within the federal country.
Other districts must also contribute.
Seehofer: "No borders are locked"
In a longer phoneat with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Head of State Josef PÃ¼hringer (VP) agreed the further action in the refugee question on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not locked down.
The further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany.
However, the seekers would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, PÃ¼hringer once more demanded greater solidarity in the refugee issue.
For PÃ¼hringer, that Austria also introduces checks at its borders is "a logical consequence" from the Germans' action.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The generalization of the "New yard" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, S&T, S&T, a stock-owned IT group, which is intended to rent to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT the wise heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T-Chef Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine to invest in new yard startup companies and later to accede to those.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just a question of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the FFG.
The building is deported from Linz AG for 60 years to S&T as well as Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters left in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni captain opened second business in the Arcade
Furla handbags are at the centre of the new shop.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to put a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to suspend this project shortly in the dove market academy: Finally, she has now grown in the form of another business place.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and garments of various manufacturers, everything is now turning around women's bags of the brand Furla, money exchanges must have from 75 euros.
Greater pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time if I should open another store," says Breit.
Among other things, the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were involved in the idea of a own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in Linz, who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has got Breit in the wiege from her mother.
I am most suitable when something develops and I can show new trends at low price.
Why, when some woman looks at a beautiful handbag in tightening, the professional woman can't answer with the last security.
Maybe it's because a nice bag of every outfit is exploding.
The breezemaker from Kalstadt
Donald Trump's ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called collectors.
This property also combines some with the billionary who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he is opposed to himself, journalists are in distress or reveal knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. Presidential Office strongly raises the campaign.
And cut it off well.
This is also registered in the Pfalzish Kalstadt, where the grandparents of the property billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the FÃ¶hnfrisur is a term for many in the Winzerdorf on the wine street.
Some in the 1200 resident location is over thirty corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in election fight mode.
The Cold Town of Simone Wendel filmed a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the world's most powerful man?
"I think they find this somewhat exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter Art," says Simone Wendel.
The breached calf townwoman has played an amusing documentary film about the place and its famous pronouncers, among which, alongside Trump, the Ketchup family of Heinz is also part of the ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also comes to word in "Kings of Kalstadt" (2014) in such a way that he would certainly be successful if he would live in Kalstadt.
He did not bring it to the King of the Hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, it is also tendency to think that Trump is "a little grandmill," says Wendel.
At random, the nickname, which has Kallstadt in the circulation, sounds "The Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch: the investors, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the host.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a local for golden graves in the USA.
Base of the real estate group were first land purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragic: their desire to return to the home permanently failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Pfalz belonged at that time.
He didn't record Trump because he had once been cut off without permission, the director of the Institute for Faintish History and People's Science, Roland Paul, had explained to start a movie.
Trump is the grandson of an illegal exiler.
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly spoken of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"As the polters, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote relative Trumps ("The Oma was a born Trump, the Opa was born Heinz").
The winner in retirement sees the American rather distant, "he is always so upset".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pension wizard Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ on a visit, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine the Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She finds it better if he doesn't want the choice, because "it has such radical views, I don't know if this is good".
If those who had said in the U.S. time his grandfather would have been like him, "he would never have arrived there".
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzertochter Sarah BÃ¼hler.
And as President?
"My President isn't it," she says.
And, "The grapes will also be mature without President Trump".
Wendels Film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinematographers, even in the USA, the interest is awakened.
The Bavarian municipality Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice President at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800 resident village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "gigher villages".
In the neighboring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for the award of the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have at least 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurlen to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has not made major shifts in the reviews for Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was emitted by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull created the fall of Tony Abbott.
The Rival Sunrise, with the fashioners David Koch and Samantha Armytages, was located in London as part of a one-week series of international television programs, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 viewers in the five main cities, compared with Today 39.000.
Today achieved a slight increase in the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,00 spectators of 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for the review!
Written by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recent widowed father, who decides to stay with his two children on the New Zealand coast, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million spectators.
Criticians asked if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and easily struck The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half an hour (17:00 to 17.30 p.m.) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, showed an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 pm to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia achieved 520,000 spectators and 720,000 sat in the second half of an hour.
Hot Seat on average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of The Chase Australia's second evening, Nine will be confident that hot seed will finally take place at 5:30 a.m.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for million dollars minute that has not been able to overlap the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Mystery unveiled? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have seemed unaware who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, who finally landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was kept in the greatest secret.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up if she is the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before we get out of three two, you may have given accidentally an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips until the final sealed on Thursday
All three women have left themselves lyrically out of the reason why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude as a reason why they would like to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked, "If you don't, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers could be to the player who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except themselves - called Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day.
"From the moment I went to the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sams Energien, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought this throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it makes so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week the house visit made her clear that Wood could be "the One".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now obscure to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not, she was puzzled.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is emitted on Wednesday 19:30, at Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a rank as it did the Aussie-Rugby-Liga convert at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also to the current game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dress cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly at his press conference after the game.
The 49 Sports Reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his snatched catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patzt at a point restored by Minnesota Vikings in the first game district
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian succession for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the Fumble, and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he couldn't imagine a worse start in his NFL career.
"That was a thing that happens now, you only take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his Origin DebÃ¼t in 2007, when a passport in his own in-Goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the schools
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian wheelfield with weapons.
After he had challenged President Vladimir Putin openly, Khodorkovsky was sentenced to his oil company Yukos and undermined his democratic efforts.
The free electors demand the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers.
Chief of Party and Group Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Herbstklausur in GroÃŸwallstadt against a severe crisis in Bavarian schools, if there are no new teachers to many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from the collapse," said Aiwanger.
"So we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The free elector's country day fraction meets in the underfranky municipality until Friday.
In fact, very different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free electoral tours.
"Of course, asylum will overlay the clause," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it had been during the Yugoslav war in the 1990s.
"This is not how it goes, we have to go on the causes," said the Free WÃ¤hler-Chef.
Declined asylum seeks to disfellowship the free electors as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW-Chef criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We needed uniform standards throughout the country."
"Bayers turn off, others don't."
"There we need to be more able to handle."
However, national policy in GroÃŸwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A year-long permanent burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
During the new school year, Minister of Cultus Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot trial "Middle Level plus" at 47 gymnasia, in which an extension of the gymnasial middle level is tested from three to four years - in the result it will last nine years until the abitur.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The theme G9 must be accelerated," said the FW-Chef.
We demand freedom of choice for all gymnasiasias who want this.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after police shooting rubber shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shot into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out in Rupandehi District on Tuesday evening, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, leading district officers, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, while some of you threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before she took back on rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It wasn't immediately clear why the used rubber shots, of which are known to kill, but traditionally used as less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the Ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflicts since the 10th century.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial subject in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the Constitutional Draft in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at Emer Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters.
Planned is a mixture of trade, commercials and housing - but there are no specific offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a 4000 square metres plot in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre of Alte Post.
The preparations for this are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, commercials and housing.
Waiting for appropriate offers, it's called by the city.
Which investor is questioned is not yet clear.
No contracts have also been concluded accordingly.
The city of Emden had purchased a part of the property located on the RingstraÃŸe / Ecke GroÃŸe StraÃŸe a few months ago and let the building on it go.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for holiday homes at the Small Sea near Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Some liars are further distressed - they fear the sale of their recreational reception
For months after closed doors were negotiated, crushed, debated and signed.
Now the plans for a new holiday home on the Small Sea are near Emden on the table.
The interested person, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented his plans for the first time publicly on Monday evening in the Emder Council's City Development Committee.
It was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP Group, which prescribed the investor and the administration of mystery crowery, Ralf Behrends went from the system building management into the offensive: "We have not yet got an answer to all questions," he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The approximately ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been discussed for months.
Severe reactions among seaboats owners who had entered the meeting brought out the pictures and new details for the desired building of the hotel.
Roberto Schulz, seaboats owner and board member at the representatives of the Lieutenant, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is a giant cloth that exceeds all the other buildings."
He also fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would grow strongly through the planned size of the plant: "There must be whole bus charges to expect this," said Schulz
However, what is happening exactly on the well a hectare large area of the former restaurant is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First, we have to have a conclusive concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Two-year-old teenagers at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is delighted with his gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian has brought about twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it is said by the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet firm, since Mother Dian holds her close to the body until now.
First, the "image" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cycling south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide low pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, e.g. in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60- percent potential to form a tropical wire storm in the next two days, adding the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double-donation campaign to bring $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations as they flee from the war crushed and armed countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach when notifying the donation call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud wrote about her personal experience with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old.
"On our trip, many dark trains and buses, like hunger, thirst, cold and scared," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations are doubled to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerlief to $11 million.
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has distributed more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, broken by war.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetes.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote a editorial article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of their own body to absorb food.
Over the years, Adipositas operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are sickly fatly with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obesity.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwanâ€™s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of adipositas surgery - Magenbypass and stomach hose - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI of those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, BMI remained in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments about the same in 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% resolved diabetes completely and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, compared with this, diabetes completely resolved only at one percent and in part with only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglyceride and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, reflecting the blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas tractomy group (18.7 vs. 14,2 kg), increased decreases in the BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and more reported a complete overlap of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16,7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years in the case of fat-lying people who were undergoing an adipositas operation - compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was soothing for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because she says that this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group," she said without increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30 years old.
"I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think as soon as they have gathered these genetic changes that have attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult to reverse."
Love Story Plays in HunsrÃ¼ck
It is a topic that is currently increasingly in Belletics: a young woman, unloved and inconspicuous at school times, after years meets the swarm of her youth, and he is in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Everything we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the history of love, the novel may be especially interesting for HunsrÃ¼cker readers, for he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The principal professional author has grown up in Langweiler and is delighted that she could set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis was in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents under the circumstances given.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how a genuine peace and real development can be created, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about the reduction of killing in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's action after the terror attack of September 11th and revealed that the violent reaction of the United States moved into a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolence in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he took violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the intake of hands disinfectants by children over the last 4 years
Gift control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow strongly alcoholic hand defectives, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of Handdes Infections in children under 12 years of age reported to poison control centres rose from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children come more and more often to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them go in the emergency recording," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children willingly drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or for a courageous sample in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Youths are said to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwater to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with peanut, grape and orange fragrance, which are very appealing to children.
Hand infectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
Especially in small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Gift Notrufzentrum at the hospital of the University of Kansas, Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a swallow Whisky stand around, but people leave this hand disinfectants in the range of children, and if children come to it, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four syringes from the scent of hand - infectious narcotics in school, was brought to an emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is considered to be drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah smiled her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency recording.
Doctors watched them in a separate childâ€™s hospital overnight on signs of Hirn-Trauma, since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and shot her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very anxious," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been dead for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfection cloths and to store hand disinfectants outside the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died of women after swallowing hands disinfectants containing a toxic, non-declared ingredient.
Health authorities believe that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was notified as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by declaring antibacterial products around the teaching room," reports a police report.
The teacher is high-grade allergic to hand disinfectants and expelled them from her room.
The police viewed the decayed plan as "black" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been easily injured in an accident on the cross-section between North Ring and On Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver travelled on the cross-section to the circulation industrial area and observed too late that two previous vehicles had stopped in the circulation.
As a result, he poured his truck into an Audi's rear and pushed this vehicle on a Ford Fiesta standing before.
In the case of accidental vehicles, some 10 000 euros were damaged, the police notified.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be dragged off.

Hearts will fight SFA because of Neilson's accusation and warburton will be cautious at January-Neuve obligations that could destroy the unity of the framework
Dons increase leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a short victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays speech on disharmonise
There are rumors about disharmonisation at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths. He and his teammates were not under increased control because they were preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players look forward to it.
The lack of title competition in the Scottish football bore Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers Central Field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title rituality with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an Ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers are not there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams, and that's what they're interested.
There is a lot of tension in the old company games, and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against MalmÃ¶ and the subsequent excretion from the Champions League followed the defeat against Aberdeen ten men, which now stands clearly at the top of the table with five points.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel that right, but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes players better.
Now standing together is so important.
Warburton cautiously on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which pointed out that he had a few January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful in signing new accesses and keeps insisting that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox-Kader unit.
The ex-chief of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal hint
Swansea storm Michu, with Celtic in conversation during the transfer period, indicated that he could withdraw when his contract expires with the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a harsh knees for two years and has not succeeded the exit from Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle for Neilson's Comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defendant was later revoked - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains what he said, and keeps on saying, "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on any performance."
Griffiths sworn to avoid Tynecastle
The unsolverable hipbee was corrected after he admitted to sing a song with intimidating texts about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a kneipe in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer, adding, "It's safe to say that I don't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly keeps in mind that the Executive Board of Dundee United still trusts in the management team to rotate things - but acknowledges that the decline must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll bring the boys back to stab," said Donnelly.
McInnes glad to win "unbeautiful" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fought desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh successive league victory that brought them a lead of five points before Celtic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys's Elfmeter in the first half of time.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything in pokal games or lays that haven't even won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is increasing in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged to 164,000 in May to July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above the UK's 5.5 percent, as the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now 2.612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a number above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said, "The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drinkers disturbed the expiry
Since the security staff could not satisfy the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray, the officials were able to keep the distortioners in custody.
An atemalkoholtest reported 0.89 proms in a 16-year-old.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 proms and first stayed in custody.
Why I'm going to be witness to an executive in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'm going to sit in a viewer gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is excuted by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day approached, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agree because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the USA, and since more applications are available than places, a macawry lottery takes place to decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will see it emotionally.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phones and a two and a half hours of visit.
I like the guy.
We're often laughing when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I complained about her.
She admitted that she could have "formed it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of Witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I've done.
I don't want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would owe him to be a beneficiary of the act.
But I think that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can contact.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police persecution hunting persuades to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt from a man from Perth to hang off the police was unsuccessful when he was in soft and moist water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "pray him gentlely to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale was called for a house peace break in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspects, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water--and said, 'I don't come out, come and get me,' said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he turned a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated".
"Some times people do fun things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Mastership football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins took his car into the graves to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to pioneer him and threatened to stop racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a racing day treatment, the last straw halm on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt dump sample at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had kept himself back for 18 months because of the spying accusations and didn't want it "except like too high-hanging grapes."
"I hadn't said anything about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised heads, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do that, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had made the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to pioneer his stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - which I'm going to name when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing within my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
They seem to believe I'm a deceitor.
If that is the case, they should surely take their nose because they failed in trying to hold me.
Robert Roulston, formerly Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, official president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of that and are still today.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL acted vaguely and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and breach me, and I have no doubt that what I say lets her think about it now.
But I've arrived at the point that doesn't matter, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the trainer built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he could "shoot his license over the table."
Moody, most well known by his preparation of the unpleasant master Black Caviar, described the racing day treatment rule "cheapy" after a pack of mud or tone had been placed on the horse legs, which dismissed the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
"One of my employees wrongly put mud on the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday.
But it also had it on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the packing on the race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after riding flight
On the weekend, the police arrested a man after a collapse with a cyclist and then a rider flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia from the police was in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of driving flights and abandoned assistance and of other traffic offenders.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital. He is in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy fights against rivals for claims to fight rings
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy called criticism of his players as "Agenda-Setting" of two NRL's prime League favourites.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the arbitrators allowed the Storm Players "Ringkampfs" with his team during the high Storm victory in the Qualifying Finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a barely covered remark on the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "Muster Example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "te good" in the rings.
Bellamy defended the tac climb of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" when they tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers to his team conscientiously voted to him, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"Trent Robinson talked about ring fights when they hit us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing all year round to our defensive system or techniques. But in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has made the trend change for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he is probably not used to lose, so it was a little shock for him.
It's already funny as this occurs again and again at this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "sustaining football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "long" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with us on Friday evening and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the Broncos game against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points of excitement?
It's the plans for me.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend, since they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in front of the AAMI Park next Saturday evening. Ticket sale starts from next Tuesday morning.
Serbia with $200,000 deposit by drug liability
A man who may threaten a lifelong penalty because of his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Solay, which came over Vanuatu from South America and in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was observed how he met his fellow accused at the Jachthafen during the morning and later at CafÃ© Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially lifelong penalty for the attempt to have a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole crowd and that the cafÃ© could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relationships with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stieffather had offered a deposit of $200,000 as a security together to reach his release.
"After reading the ideological statements of the two persons, it is clear that the edition of a security of $200,000 constitutes a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he leaves his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police daily and holds to a starting lock of 18:00-06:00.
Unfall on A5 at Karlsruhe: Guidehouse breaks apart
In the case of an accident with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried to avoid turning out to the left at the last moment, as the police told.
The guidehouse of the accident causer rose completely apart.
The driver was seriously injured to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely locked over six hours to 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of EUR 122,000.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to lure pedophile to send pictures
A pedophiler used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone, when this slept, entered an online Meessaging service, from which he received a number of unpleasant pictures from children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "fitting" web searches, which used terms for the search for improper pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done so as it would lead to "pedophile on the Internet" and then "determined to be a policeman to scare them".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a addiction - that he was guilty to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were performed by him, but said it was happening because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophile.
He was asked for his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She also saw the improper pictures on the phone and confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared himself guilty in the sense of the accusation of having taken up unfair pictures of children last June, breaching the charges on January 25th of this year and not appearing before court to be a hearing on March 24th of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked for Hogg not to appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his wrongdoing.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael dismissed the judgment until October in order to obtain background reports about social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in investigation for hearings to other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Schleuser varies from small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are taken away from the major control points at the German-Austria border.
In fear of discovery and arrest, many sleeusers made people increasing on smaller crossings of borders
On the Austrian side, a spokesman of the Federal Police said.
Along the border flow of Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been caught in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They were walking over bridges and steam guns on the German side.
There they are received by federal policemen and forwarded to registration.
On the Munich main train station, according to Federal Police claims, more refugees came again significantly in comparison to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
At 8 a.m. only about 700 people arrived in the capital of the country, said a speaker in the morning.
After the re-introduction of controls at the German-Austria border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Exploitors of Tropensturm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against stormbows in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German weather service (DWD) was notified in Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the runner of the tropical storm "Henry", which had been pulled over the Atlantic over the past days from the Bermuda Islands.
Hard storms and thunders are expected mainly in Baden.
According to DWD, even in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Bodenseekreis, until Thursday early, it is expected to be bows from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour.
On Friday, then, the sun can be viewed again longer.
The mass makes it: every two years the car builders on the IAA show their novelties.
In 2015, the main movement is the compact car, which currently sells itself particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly demanded: Around 28.1 percent of the new registrations, according to the power station (KBA) alone on this segment in August.
This is also reflected on the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Between all futuristic design vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars this year, many new compact models are presented.
One of the largest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will stand with the dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chef Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new astra is not to be much more expensive.
Opel has an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf that starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1,4-liter motor with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the Hesse offers other diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, which are also for the first time drift cylinder benzine engines.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only five doors.
The second version will follow in the spring of the Combi, which can also be seen on the IAA.
And what will be done next to the Astra on the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault MÃ©gane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his astra competitors MÃ©gane to the race.
At the fair, the MÃ©gane can only be seen as a five-door in a conventional and highlighted sporty GT version.
He comes to trade early next year, then also as a Combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan depositor wants to find its position with the new model in the strongly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its swept lines fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with at least 90 kW/122 PS power.
However, the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to manufacturers.
Sale start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble CitroÃ«n delegator mainly put on the front part: Here the cooler grill was re-signed and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernised, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and first integrated Apples CarPlay.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants, such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI, are gathered on the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: five square meters of cell are human invaluable
The Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex-challenge of the Execution Centre Tegel, which had been housed in a small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are placed in small cells.
This was the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can even hope for money even if they were imprisoned only a few days in the spaces to be close (Act: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This succeeded an ex-challenge with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in a single cell with a floor area of about five square meters between June and November 2009 in the Berlin Trial Centre; the toilet was not separated.
Then, according to his lawyer, the man who was relocated on a free foot was moved to a larger cell.
Although his detention complaint failed because of the unworthy imprisonment conditions against the country of Berlin.
However, the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case for re-examining it.
You see the man's dignity injured.
Chamber Court is now deciding on the amount of compensation
Even if for legal reasons of the period in question only a few days of detention for compensation were relevant, it was said that a compensation claim was granted.
Otherwise, "a care of the legal protection of the personality should be feared."
The chamber court must now clarify the amount of compensation.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they only agreed to a prisoner in April because he was naked in a cell.
According to a decision of 2011, human inadmissible is also the multiple occupation of a cell without a separate toilet.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday, which had certified to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The then plaintiff was housed in a similar cell between 15 and 21 hours daily for three months as in the Karlsruher case.
The Berlin prisons have also come to the headlines in recent weeks because of lack of staff.
Consequently, prisoners are repeatedly enclosed 23 hours, which increases aggressivity, even to battles due to the tense situation.
According to the court press office, 21 places in Tegel are not occupied because of childhood shortages, 19 is supposed to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We're gonna do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's happening to Germany?
About 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year after the Federal Ministry of Interior forecasts, according to Vice-Kanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take up a million refugees.
Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do it."
What comes to Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as has been built (250000 apartments).
Dramatic is the lack of living space, however, especially in the case of affordable rentals: annually, 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond, and for these particularly affordable apartments, refugees will also apply.
Federal Minister for Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the promotion, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the Pestel Instituteâ€™s view: 80 000 social housings have to be created annually and for this, the Bund would have to invest a amount of 6.4 billion a year.
Scientists and Federal Ministry of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
The Institute for Labour and Professional Research estimates that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be active in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them begin, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-evaluation of immigrants, says migration researchers Dietrich ThrÃ¤nhardt.
In Germany, according to ThrÃ¤nhardt, there has been a political turn: from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work.
While there was earlier a ban on asylum applicants for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the obligation to reside, the asylum applicants were restricted to a place of residence.
In society, also due to the lack of professionals, the majority of the view has been that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster.
A large barrier to access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge.
There is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses yet.
Investigations also show that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, according to ThrÃ¤nhardt, the king's road to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that few refugees give their children to Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the rooted parents it is only very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration of handcuffs is distributed in different languages.
If the need for trainees grows strongly through the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity, for example by allowing more vocational schools.
In the countries, students are being prepared for teaching in welcome classes without German knowledge.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack in them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
Principlely no federal country prohibits asylum applicants or patienced the study - the only exception was Berlin until now, interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his attitude.
Voluntary refugees could be facilitated to access the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or tolerance no longer receive benefits under the asylum claiming service law when they start a study.
In principle, the latter do not get bafÃ¶g because they do not fall among the circle of the beneficiaries.
Gedulded refugees must have lived in Germany for four years to be BafÃ¶g-authorized, from 1 January 2016 to 15 months.
However, this financing gaps must also be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Work demand.
Students should get BafÃ¶g immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should grant Islam successive the same rights as they have the churches and further develop existing state church law to a new state religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish a Islamic well-being association that carries for the newcomers professionally.
Rights include duties.
Thus, Islam's representatives must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control opportunities.
This includes the willingness to deal with religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to stay here, in Germany", he said in the Bayrian radio.
He suggested that the basic law be translated into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than a topic of the whole society today.
This will also need to change the majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, been a anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a short decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU war series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Similar opportunities for all: What migrants organisations and the groups of non-white Germans have long demanded for and what international agreements, such as the Anti-Rassism Convention, require Germany, must be realised in the coming years when the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizensâ€™ opportunities for all.
Generally, Germany was able to care for the refugees that have been expected medically, said doctor Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As for man power and capacity, we can do this," he said to the day level.
However, additional money has to be entered into the system for this purpose.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands to hang out health cards to all convenants in the same way as registration.
Services provided could be taken into account with the federal countries later.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to use so many people with the limited performance catalogue provided by the Asylum Supreme Act.
Otherwise, the doctors are primarily making the language barriers.
So far, Berlin's health scientist Thea Borde has proved that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in doctoral practices, it demands interpreting costs.
However, many refugees would be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are dealing with HIV information.
With the partially other disease images, German doctors would be clear from their training, Montgomery says.
"Parasite attack or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize" and as regards the lack of doctors, the refugees may even have relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, some refugees are even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps re-examine tests.
At least half of the refugees in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent TU Munich study demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Those who have suffered from a posttraumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with breathing, dizziness, heart grass and death fears.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong horror and emotional fatigue.
In order to prevent the symptoms from chronic, early treatment is necessary, MÃ¼nz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of the psychiatricly ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychically sick asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices most of the subject workers or doctors who are not trained for psychiatric diseases would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misevaluations, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new stage "Leidenschaft" the Circus Probst takes back the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to draw every age group into the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal addresses and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites the maneuver on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and Junior Chief.
"Leadership" - under this motto stands the current manegen indication.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family.
So the gift for enthusiasm is in the blood of the family.
"It is important for us to take people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours," says the 27-year-old Junior Chief.
"Manegencocktail with World Town Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family pulls the audience with joke and charm into their ban.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craftsmanship.
With the hero of the stupid films it wants to take the Cuban duo loose.
Ease and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is intended to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Testst also fascinate with fingertip feeling and jointness.
Balance with the single wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake humans fascinate and fear at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little others and fascinates with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanies Mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disadvantages in the attitude of circus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not good, we are not well".
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-minded artists", as they are called loving, will be read out of the eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel comfortable, it doesn't want to go into the manege either.
So the top command: provide good care for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhenst and a Zebrastute, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
For every visitor, then, something is supposed to be there.
"One thing is sure," says Stephanie Probst, "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always give our best and are with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites his ideas daily from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 a.m.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is family day, for the idea at 7 p.m. the prices are reduced.
The animal show is also open daily from 10 to 18 o'clock.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe holds wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained unwholesome, but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media.
Parliament's opening was also deceived by claims by Members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and had been warned of accompanying Mr Mugabe's speech with buhrufen.
Last month, they had put him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the movement for democratic change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they warned against disrupting Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but she has the title 'Death'," he spoke journalists to Mugabes.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and, as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "sorged" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings in the company's services.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its service activities.
The expected job reduction leads to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in an explanation.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard-Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we have a broad and deepened portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will be concentrated on the provision of unriched, integrated technology solutions for companies so far," says a company's explanation.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical plants and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
HP has carried out a massive restructuring in order to cope with the departure of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies are making better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the hurt Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation expires according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship in the next summer is still uncertain.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate snail injury and then returned to his old swing during the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a major matter.
This was just an accident.
It wasn't in connection with his necks or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger recognized, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08, they were one of the two premier League clubs that have to record most injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from a injury, you have a random period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and win fighting power," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will run through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday, and Wenger sets a rotation within the team.
HÃ©ctor BellerÃ­n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and to give the players a small break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to continue through Group F, the Maksimir City in Zagreb is one of the most intimidated playgrounds in Europe.
After 41 games, Dynamo is also ungeschlagen after the "unconquerable" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measured on Judge scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has pulled the lesson from the last season with the Champions League headquarters against Monaco and remains driven from the far-reaching hope of leading the association with his management to his first European pokal triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friends
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has become even more desperate than ever before, as suicides among young men prove to be at a 15-year-old high.
In 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men from 20 to 45 years old in Great Britain, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign against an indignant life) announced 2015 as the year of man, with the aim of questioning the culture that men prevent from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "sundered mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first so that a friend can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on style about substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vivid and successful, even though in reality isolation is dominated.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extreme values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our spiritual health much more.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can't really buy luck.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head.
Each character was defined, not by his work, but by his personality, shining by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent embraces, moments at the soccer gambling in cozy seats and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can in any case refer to it, even if they often hold back, completely exploring their feelings.
As a telephone care employee explained to me, "My listener role for people who feel depressive and threatened to suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old speech "I am right with it" has a tremendous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one speaks openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer more long-term handling mechanisms.
It clearly presents the little moments of men's friends.
As much as my objective external status via the phone can help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the entirely newly designed culisse for the celebration of the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG to crush MalmÃ¶
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against MalmÃ¶.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass by MalmÃ¶.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against MalmÃ¶ in the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who led to the French master, but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani reached a headball gate in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in the group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they not only seek the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but a improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, there was no class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed opportunities before the gate. He was later exchanged in the game against his hometown team and against the association with which he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect in the course of the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't have one or two more gates."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned in one of three changes to the Paris team, which was able to hold a 2:2 indecisive place against Bordeaux in the First League during the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing tower was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why when he walked in Marco Verrattis Pass behind the MalmÃ¶ defense before he closed Johan Wiland beautifully into the long corner of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory that was disappointed.
MalmÃ¶, who struck Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, took up at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But in addition to a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far from Kevin Trapp's posts in the 34th minute, they offered little attack.
Instead, PSG occasionally renounced himself, with some failures and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who was patted in the first half in five trials alone and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria turned into a shoot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52th minute at the p ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan achieved his sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic had caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that MalmÃ¶ could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was known a gate at the end.
The trainer of MalmÃ¶, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last champion League game was last year in December.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The skills games are not sufficient."
Get away from Paris!
It was a great game of them!

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
World and Europe champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was apparently a few years ago before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Pokalsieger, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer, after 24 years, the 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now tells him that he was before the EM 2008 departure from Barcelona.
"They told me that BarÃ§a wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we won nothing," he says.
And that also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer of Bavaria."
"Rumenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not happen.
And today, the man who makes it work for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why, "BarÃ§a has contracted Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's what he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's playtime would have been running with Xavi 2008/2009.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter finale of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the whole distance on the racing, switched the red (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the king's class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays diversity in the creation of movies
Matt Damon confronted the Afro-American filmmaker Efffee Brown during a discussion on diversity and said that she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a series of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when it emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected screening of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then do it when you place the film and not when the show is placed," Damon assured.
Brown responded shocked, with insulted in faith and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the commentary of the actor of The Martian strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined the producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show fanlists.
"I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony," Brown first said.
The only black person, and she is a nut beaten by her white salary.
The producer of Dear White People joined the film for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied that their director could give us something we do not want.
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter-user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's so conscious that it hurts".
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since his publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the top of social discussion.
After the teen Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took effect across the country and urged legislatures and authorities to oppose discriminatory practices against colourful stopping.
In February, the singer Prince played on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (Alben still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers, and media mogules that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Profi-port climbers and service aid Isaac Caldiero became the first athlet to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the Great Price of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competitive participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle parcours.
During the final season, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, were able to go to the final.
The last task was to climb at a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time he was the first athlet to complete the efforting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-fighted victory, still under the shock about the profit of the Great Price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about that I have never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his lot of money.
So suddenly .. as I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed joined The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why British, although he was the first to finish the parcours, do not receive any price.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there are more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's grieving about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they exchanged the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the spinning will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers slept on Minnesota Twins past
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They were once one of the best teams in the baseball, today the tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but this part played perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word, which was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) shot 6 times in the 1/3 Innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish strongly this year," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullp, and so I want to go into the game very concentrated.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit game by Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He swallowed the wood well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (training), looked much better at the bullp, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs at the back meeting at the end of the seventh Innings, the Twins had their best chance to come back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the Inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to Strikeout before he was replaced by the left hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy, the only man with whom he was confronted, survived in front of Miguel Sano's designated Rookie actress, who had a two-run entrissed the Judge Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27th time in the Major League in this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth Innings, Mauer created an RBI double against the closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and achieved the position of 5-4.
The right-handed man, however, left Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a not yet moving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers achieved three runs in the first two Innings against the Right Hands Veteran, which had been deleted by the injured list before the game after he had missed more than one month for a back suffering.
"Of course not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable than I left and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After they first received the Leadoff Bather, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the Scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third which ended the threat.
In the second, the tigers achieved a one-out double from Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from Center Field Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"It was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he caught the right place.
Hughes was located in a Pitch count, did not reach any points in the third Inning before he was replaced by the Reliever Lawyers A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four stripouts.
NOTE: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez excluded because of an injuries of the gun.
He was studied by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid August on the injured list because of a shoulder decay, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is deleted from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was purchased in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th
He has missed the right hip gel since August 20th.
The tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are supposed to live in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who are therein are to be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden reported on Tuesday evening.
It counted with 450 to 750 refugees incoming.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital have been prepared for this case in the past days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the government presidium for the first intake, 7500 people have arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau also set up emergency accommodations in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The Head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria as a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options should not take place without Germany," he said.
He proposed "collective way-looking" to the European States.
Four years ago one was happy that the cup of military participation in Germany has passed away.
"Now the conflict rushes in front of our door," he said in the German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase in international assistance on site for refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany Austria also introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian interior minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF, no one is sent back to Hungary.
Germany has also not sent refugees back to Austria.
"No, this is so agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria a day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions on this subject between the Director-General for Public Security and Representatives of Germany.
Concrete figures did not call them and refer to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin.
During the past days tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Its goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU States have not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis so far.
The Ministers of the European Union want to take a new start at a special meeting on Tuesday (22 September) for the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong rank of refugees in Germany, the covenant wants to strengthen the support of the countries in the first recording and distribution of people.
The Bund will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four-hour discussions with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor Office in Berlin.
Merkel underlined those people who need protection also.
However, those who do not have a staying perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This view has been clearly shared in the round.
The prosecutor stressed that the state as a whole now had to handle a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed his 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania should be locked off with a fence.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU.
Hungary wanted to prevent Schlepper from seeking retirement routes over Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto to the planned new border.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, however, there were thousands of other migrants going to the Greek border.
Space Supply "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice cream of the Saturnmond Enceladus, a global ocean is swept.
This concludes researchers from observations of the "Cassini".
Accordingly, the moon eases on its path around the ring planets.
Although this dive movement is only small but still too large for a continuously solid sky body, it is said in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
For a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice ceiling of Enceladus.
Thus, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of the Saturn Moon, feeding water vapor and ice particles and thus feeding the so-called E-ring of the Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must leave for a month on an open activist Valdet Rama.
An investigation had resulted in an injury to the adductor of the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to MÃ¼nchner LÃ¶wen, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced break".
"It's hard for us, Rama's a tough loss."
"Of course, we have to think now," said Sports Director Necat AygÃ¼n of the "Image" magazine with a view to the possible commitment of a unifying professional.
As a training guest, however, the 1960s initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian has currently "the opportunity to prove his ability".
TorjÃ¤ger Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his brain shock next week.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the course training.
Okotie had been injured in the game at Fortuna DÃ¼sseldorf (0:3) in a heavily collapse.
In contrast to the first fears, he remained without a serious blessure.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to take care of his slender line is often more disapprovaled by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: In them, B-vitamins and vitamins E and C. Especially include mango, but a lot of vitamin A and its prepayment of beta-carotin.
Who eats the fruits thus supports vision, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone doesn't tell about how mature the fruit is - so also green mangoes can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet foods.
However, a mango also gives heartfelt dishes a special note.
It mildens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well to fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The US package service UPS is rebuilding up to 95000 assistance for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, informed UPS on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are searched for.
UPS had already increased his work for the holiday season by 95000 aids last year.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been meeting arrangements for the Christmas business last year.
In 2013 late deliveries had made the package services harsh criticism.
First FÃ¶hnsturm, then Marking Kaltfront
In the coming night, in the valleys of the Alpennord side of the FÃ¶hn, as Meteoschweiz reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the hairdress is partially blowing with stormy strength through the hairdressers.
After the end of the day on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, which brings strong rainfall, windbows and a temperature decline.
According to MeteoNews in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area across the British islands in a strong southwest stream.
On the Alpennord side breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday.
As a result, the hairdress blows into the hairdressers of 60 to 100 km/h, separately and in particular in the Urnerland, with over 100 km/h.
The hairdryer can penetrate to the adjacent central country, and even on the mountains, orkan trees are possible from over 120 km/h.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hairdresses provide summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, moisture begins to steep on the AlpensÃ¼dhang.
Here's rain that lasts until Thursday evening.
In sum, south of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square metre, which has already fallen large rain in the last days.
On Thursday morning the hairdress goes out the air, and then a cold front rolls over Switzerland with strong, partially weathered rain from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go down significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north at 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it becomes sunny and warmer at up to 25 degrees during the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther-Platz
Nearly 500 years after the reformation, there is now a Martin-Luther-Platz in Rome.
In the presence of City President Ignazio Marino, a so far unnamed place in the park was baptized on the Oppio Hill on the name of the German Reformator.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as the German theologian of Reformation.
The park is located right next to the Colosseum in the middle of Rome.
The name was requested by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
On Wednesday Jens-Martin Kruse, priest of the Evangelical-Lutherian community in Rome, reminded that the Protestants in the city of the Popes were often able to live their faith as a minority for centuries only in the hidden.
The place becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith was welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustiner monk in Rome for the 1510/11 annual turn.
At that time, he felt the city as a perfumed sinful bastard.
His negative impressions, according to his historians, should have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the nightly church with his theaters against the detachment trade.
Hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works Otmar old painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and fantasy shapes has been given to the 75-year-old - but that is not the same thing as "spiritful" pictures.
On the contrary, adapting to the subjects in question can be quite dark.
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the "book of all books".
There are cycles that devote topics such as crossroads, plagues, commandments, or our father.
With this, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing with its focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of painting, has interpreted with the respective scriptures.
He has interpreted the scriptures selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into today, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between Martin Luther's original biblific quote and each a set of artists, who here formulate his entire personal thoughts about the situation in question.
The jewelry tape has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old equally doubles a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 born in Wernigrode and grew up in Berlin, come from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Lordhuter order.
"There was training with the pipestock," Otmar Alt remembers.
"I've tried to work on this, perhaps to treat me again with the Lord Father."
His second concern is to help art in a fast-lived time again to make more important: "The perception of picture worlds is characterized by advertisements today, and it is loud.
Symbolics are being thirsty.
Artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to be "involved" in the pictures, let them work, discover and feel the strength they have: "The image is looking for his opposite."
Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "always" to be a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Old did not hesitate to fully grasp the Bible but to select the important, also mysterious, topics that are important to him.
"This was no cooperation at eye height," says Altepost, "This is about the pictures that the text explains only".
For Hans MÃ¶hler of the Luther publisher, this work is an invitation to "develop his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's images speak for MÃ¶hler both the (Biblical) language of love and the responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened in the Otmar Old Foundation on 15 November.
Construction start near for BMX train
Plans made, found place, company commissioned, Earth Hill modeled for a round course: A year later, almost everything was finished â€“ yet before the official opening of the BMX train was already finished.
Political and administrative failures provided for distortions, especially in the residents who did not want to to tolerate the railway.
So hills demolished, new place searched - now with formal planning and application for construction permits.
The authorization was to enter in October, the first municipal councilman Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to communicate to the Kinder- und Jugendkomitee.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started with the work at the former hall bath without "more memorial break".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees by 2019, and the Federalliga makes a clear sign on the weekend.
Soccer responds to the key situation in Germany and assures policy its help in addressing the problems facing them.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"In principle no one can say that's nothing to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"This has to be interested in each individual to get this topic into control," said DFB-Chef Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am next Wednesday at the Chancellor Office and meet the Minister of State, Ms. Ã–zoÄŸuz and the Chancellor."
"There is sure to play a central role," he announced.
The football can and want to help.
But the decisive courses must put policy.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.
"We have ensured that this programme continues until 2019", said Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal religionists also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional associations have a clear sign when they will wear the "We Help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left of the tricotary instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusen's sports chief Rudi VÃ¶ller of the "Image" magazine (day) and described the project as "of course".
"The Refugee Drama is going on everyone, no one can look away."
"We can, no, use our radiation power, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
On Friday, the National Team of Women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale to the EM-Qualification game against Hungary.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large Community work of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations in their locations would have launched their own projects is great.
The same great thing is that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we issued, will be lived in the football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and the next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, provides EUR 300 000 each for the integration of refugees.
"The associations have already picked up the whole sum for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Executive Director loses an eye in accidents
According to the Chief Officer of Europeâ€™s largest software group, Bill McDermott, several reports have lost the left eye by a fall at the beginning of July.
In the case of the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the United States, he had fallen on a glass of water that he wore in the left hand, the "Wirtschaftswoche" reported on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleededed, was innocent, then dragged out to the street - that's what he told us last week," quoted the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could follow his work.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was at the meeting and "perfectly working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung" (Donnerstagsausgabe) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was regularly in contact with the SZ and his chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott.
McDermott usually pends between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has been no longer in the German SAP centre in Walldorf.
He is important to go to the public with such a personal story, said the manager of the "SZ": "Everything can happen."
"When you fell down, it's worth standing up."
McLaren-Ersatzpilot Magnussen except fighting ...
Magnussen twittered a photograph and explained that he suffered the injury when he was crashed from the wheel.
He is therefore inquired of the two main pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button in Singapore during the weekend, as well as a few months later at the Grand Prize of Japan.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus have definitively broken down in the first group game of the Europe League.
The national player will also be missing in the Duell with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday 19.00 p.m./Sky.
"We are unfortunately not able to get back to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach opened: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday."
Given the high stress of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribal elf on the reus position.
So he announced a change on the gatekeeping position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman BÃ¼rki.
"He trained on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weidenfellers are used in the future in all Europe-League games, however, Tuchel opened.
With high probability, he will also contest the second party.
The research statement by co-player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League must be the target, considers middle field player Julian Weigl to understand: "That's why Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take off the title."
Robot cars: Government wants leading role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be, according to the will of the Federal Government, in the transformation of the car of technological leaders.
On Wednesday, the Bundeskabinett decided a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke of a "new mobility age" on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Automese IAA.
The automated and networked driving will increase transport safety and ensure less barriers, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of the industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a rapid change in digital radio broadcasting.
To test new technology, a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being created.
To ensure that the driver "no additional liability risks are imposed," the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to use internationally to raise the maximum permissible speed for self-driven cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also intends to make an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which has only been foreseen by people as a driver.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking over the lead, the driver becomes more and more passengers.
The technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process the data in seconds.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, "first long after 2020" vehicles on public roads are to be expected.
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at Germany's location estimates the authors of the study for 2025 to around EUR 8.4 billion.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport," said SÃ¶ren Bartol.
However, the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the German automobiles still see skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey presented on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Dekra Test Organization is the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will take place in the next ten years, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of the respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the USA.
However, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driven vehicle.
After a survey of Bitkom's digital association, only seven percent would agree to carry out control on all roads throughout the journey.
On the highway, the flowing traffic could always imagine 15 percent, in the steering 45 percent.
Well, every fourth would not leave control to the car under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Dusseldorfer wants to record only individually in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys have experienced it in the morning."
"We are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer JÃ¶rg RoÃŸkopf during the EM-Training in DÃ¼sseldorf.
Boll was at that time on the flight at a long-term agreed sponsor date in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Within Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favorite," said single European champion Dimitry Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who quoted the seat list in Jekaterinburg, also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Timo also missed at that time, and we became European champion."
"We should orient ourselves here," said the world ranking-fifth.
The English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg.
In the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defendant was hit at a tackling of HÃ©ctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicates that the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger had a sliding break.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figure cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: scene puppies that look horrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and that he was sitting men in the rubble.
"I can't say today that I'm the enfant terrible of the skin couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was bleached, it's real now," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Citizensteig on the runsteg), which can be seen in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo Cultural Foundation, it is a happiness that the fashion creator has changed his originally rejecting attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
If you die, you'll come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It's about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly overlooking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed training.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed total artwork for which a lot of effort was operated: For example, to freeze the dolls, a stylist has been dedicated.
14 tons of material have cared the makers to Munich according to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was still a special smankerl: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultiers old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, sensible fashional walking attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he attracted his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion he later taught himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
But later I bought them, of course.
For his first own fashion show, he couldn't pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze als Mode-Nische
In the past, it went into the long sticking machines and around plumes about making meters.
The embroidered substances and tips developed in a large amount for customers, for example, to process covers and gardins.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Fashion Point Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a larger role, was then pushed by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt calls some examples: top in jewelry, with accessories such as bags and with regional attractions.
Overall, the so-called vintage mode, which depends on past style pockets, is an increasing potential for orders.
Who does not operate niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already make half of all orders.
Fashion tip Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Stickereien together with nine other companies.
Only they may wear the protected label.
Over the last 15 years, some 80 percent of sales have been lost.
Private businesses and wholesales are almost no longer available.
Our products are hardly reaching customers in this way.
Massware is produced much cheaper in Asian space today and is almost exclusively distributed via chains.
In addition, exports are weakened, currently to Russia and the USA.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially tolerantly".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Snowberger Outer Station of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroidery and tops.
To counter the competition from Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension range between the most fresh ideas of the designers and the businesses that must especially think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to hold a customer root.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historical snowball tip.
The machine sticks small chickens in some places.
The Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Kruise was inspired by this: "I hadn't been able to start with traditional plumenary tip."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an experiencing process, she produces the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in plues and surroundings and who want a memorial piece.
This makes me see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plants new "Mary Poppins" movie
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney is still waging a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to "Entertainment Weekly", it is not about a new filming, but about a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl.
It is about the experiences of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the World Economic Crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins over 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director already stands: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy broader for the world
The economy has to open up to the outside to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group responsible for managing the reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business foundation strategies," he said in a address at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new foundations and promoting reforms will bring about new vibration and vitality and new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The Management Group has adopted a series of directives, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), inclusion of private capital, and rehabilitation of the residential media system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is continuously tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, guarantees a legal business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also facilitate checks on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In the context of an offer to open publicly controlled sectors, further areas for private investment are opened.
"The government will not change its policies against foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financed companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their activities and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also took part in Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in robberies
The European Commission intends to double the limits for mercury in large robberies and to make consumers a much higher dose of nervous poison.
The Foodwatch Consumer Organization, which has a corresponding EU working paper, criticized the plans: "Risics and adverse reactions incorrect industrial and environmental policy are being spread with full insufficiency to pregnant people and small children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt von Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nervous poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish are to be raised by one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for economic reasons.
However, large robbery are already so heavyly charged with mercury that, on the basis of the remaining limits, about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold.
After doubled the limits, only 14.5 percent would be inaccurate.
In return, the EU, according to Foodwatch, intends to intensify the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, described this as "trick", because smaller Friedfish, such as carps, are usually so low that they already hold the planned maximums today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfumed distraction manoeuvre that only helps the economy," said Wolfschmidt.
Quecksilber is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched through the food chain, especially in robberies.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "only small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn.
The Federal Ministry of Environment explains on its homepage, however, that there is no "healthy threat to the general population".
Quecksilber comes into the environment mainly through coal combustion.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power stations are experiencing more than six tons of mercury in the year, two-thirds of the total volume issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, e.g. in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanent and surface-surfaced", the "level" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European warnings against mercury in fish have already been one of the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
Foodwatch calls on consumers to protest against the EU's plans at www.quecksilber-action.foodwatch.de
