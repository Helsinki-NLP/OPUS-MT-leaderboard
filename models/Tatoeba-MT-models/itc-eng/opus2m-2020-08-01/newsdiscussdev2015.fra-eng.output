I think it looks like a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But it doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that it's common in rugby is anything big...
Yes, we don't interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we don't break anyone's nose during drinking games (at last, unless it's part of the game), but we actually painted black for some disguised evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme.
Yeaha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first-year students seemed quite typical to me.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt in my eyes that they go far beyond misogynistic jokes and jokes under the influence of alcohol often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows in particular that they are trying to provoke as much as possible.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your prejudices and stereotypes interfere with the facts?
I imagine that the rugby team LSE is populated by former students of these schools for whom the rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, old private boys.
From very different backgrounds than those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
Are "misogynistic jokes" acceptable?
It looks like my university rugby club, I've never seen racist behavior, but naked races across campus, theft, damage of goods and misogynisticness were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't say that in my last comment.
You can see it differently: say that your own body is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm going to win in serenity.
Therefore, this interstellar cloud (or not traditional:)
@lux You haven't read the article well: a small half of your pastry water has more than 4.6 billion years...
Yes, well we can nevertheless consider that the fleet of pasta has on average easily more than 2.3 billion years, which is not so bad already.
A sacred nose to the catastrophyists and hair heaters who predict the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always exists.
There is irrefutable evidence that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the outstanding work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What evidence is there that the warming stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological issues.
It is not a question for the "catastrophists" as you say to worry about the disappearance of the oceans, but rather about the reduction in human-consumable water reserves (you know the freshwater that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally, it is not the climate warming that is most threatening for our species, but especially the reduction of scarce or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly greedy lifestyles.
As for the study you mention and your generous effort to quote the source, there is little doubt of the veracity of the conclusion.
With regard to freshwater problems, I assure you that the French are far from being concerned xD Then we must stop considering ecology as a dogma without failure, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (100 per cent estimate for 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irrational ecology, not thank you.
"Then we must stop considering ecology as a non-failed dogma, the ozone layer hole is closing quietly."Yes, it's not like it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that through the action of oxygen will capture the heat without releasing it and which in a vicious circle will accelerate the process of greenhouse exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the slightest sign indicating that 10,000 good men would come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, whatever it might be?
Probably not me!
In Abbott's small brain, perhaps sending RAAF to the Middle East is its version of direct action.
We're moving back, we're sure.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot from the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% of CO2 more than any climate model allowed gives priority to replanting.
It is logical not, since CO2 is the food of plants that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora worldwide.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been laid out.
Did you see the green army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument for plant food is only a fallacious distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials is perhaps carbon, but that doesn't mean that it's the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is fallacious and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now invested where it will receive the most publicity to raise the Liberals to marginal voters.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the prize of ignorance, brave champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants realize less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
It means that animals and people must eat them in much greater quantities to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this member is a minor is obvious.
To date, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from departing from the rules of the XVII.
Nevertheless, to punish him and not Thévenoud, it is incomprehensible to the ill of the world, even if the regulation of the year is not a tax treaty.
Let this lady do a whole business not to her honour, it appears especially like hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined all those who spoke Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academy" had failed: "Let us tell Mrs. the guardianship or guardianship of the Seals" (post which had never been occupied by a woman since then).
Pure machismo!
"Political arena" ....!
The sand pot, the backyard of the Republic repeats, the marigot of the operating gutters, the table of illusions, etc.
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, good will, bad will.
Qd the Phallocrate Impists sit on the label and the parliamentary regulation by turning into the + elementary civilization under the false umbrella of the good manners, the penalty applies to him "quality" for his partisan header and his message of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making provocation to make him talk.
Until now he was unknown, now he may pride himself on being known as every cancer in a primary class is known.
The academy on the back and we see that the MPs are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to work to resolve its internal problems and stop causing the outbreaks and scandals.
The Academy has good backs, especially when they tell her what she's not saying.
This Member behaves like a college in the midst of a crisis of adolescence, which causes provocation and whose comrades go, in delegation, to see the Principal to cancel glue hours.
and defending him on the basis of a text they haven't even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories to this UMP parliamentary forum.
Mr Judge, I call on two expert witnesses who have only a few thousand separate years.
That's why I like spending time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and appealing.
Dogs, dolphins, otaries, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure that it gives them.
On the contrary, it seems that we are passionate about the majority of our 80s working, moving and doing shops.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two our lives, but we spend most of it in boredom.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion of anthropomorphism.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try it again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to go for, etc.
It is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I adhere to the idea that we hear a lot of nonsense about animals that are "playing" while they are simply communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "useful" (it may be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber believes that "there is a principle of play at the basis of all physical realities."
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have violated it" Maybe yes, hope makes life...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, be healthy and be able to respond to an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general, I am not opposed to ideas, and would even be quite enthusiastic about those who seem crazy at first sight.
But when you see what many have taken from their education at school, especially among the most likely audience to engage in assaults on women, my enthusiasm does not find the slightest beginning of anchorage.
"the most likely public to engage in assaults on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we got it.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel pink, even if it doesn't necessarily match your thought patterns.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone6.
Evry's messed up youth too!
If the reactions were no longer reacting, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first place.
I didn't learn anything from this at school and I never raped anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Do I have to think of myself as lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do we start reading life when we can't read?
And do young socialists go to suburban schools to teach gender equality?
It would be more effective than making moralizing assemblies on Twitter, but we should get out of beautiful neighborhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They're null everywhere but to teach moral lessons, it's still the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I still want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using his bread.
This week's article won't go soft.
It's not time to joke around the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You have made a double meaning word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a retirement home.
How is it that the more we pay, the less in the plate?
Because the quality of the experience does not necessarily measure the weight or number of calories, just as the quality of a film or piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to get you to buy more dishes.
It must of course not be so.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where both portions and prices are reasonably high.
You pay more because you're still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more expensive you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child portion arranged with art in your plate.
At least they've made an effort to put up with them.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can taste good dishes?
Is the Manifesto for all is only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's right: a sort of homophobic gathering.
But it's not just this one.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "children's manufacturing".
A child should not be raised in a battery farm or manufactured by a technological equipment.
Batterage?
Where did you get that?
And if you question any technical intervention in the "manufacturing", we must demand the prohibition of LDCs for heterosexual couples, that would be the merit of coherence.
I am also surprised that the so-called "for all" manifesto has not yet made this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
It is true that these are not the only cathos that manifest themselves: other religions also, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
However, it is still useful to remember that these different churches have ALWAYS been opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup was violently insurgent against the gvt's will to admit girls to school on behalf of "family defence".
We're still in the same pattern.
And more recently, the same currents shouted at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
In other words, credit can be granted to the positions of these people.
You don't need to be catho to get inundated with the marketing of belly and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom stops with that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love each other as well.
But there is no question of tolerance for the child to be a movable object.
And this is also valid for heteros looking for GPA.
I just can't love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of outrageous stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, apart from Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I cannot disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals it has marked, I will not talk about the other things it brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa do not bring or contribute anything), but perhaps that would be another reason why he won was much more often selected than, we say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12.48 Recommendation 119 It's the way to criticize Rooney right now so you can be forgiven to do so too.
That said it is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero scored 56 goals and made 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 decisive passes in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
Moreover, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridicule it.
I have to ask myself if you really look at the football or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would mark as many goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where Rooney's skills criticism comes from as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be selected regularly in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's football skills (not even an attacker) to Peter Crouch's?
Are you doing this without joking?
There are really people in the mass.
Please also note for your governor that Rooney has not always been England's leading goal machine centre during his England team career.
Instead, he played the first retreat, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written that while joking.
In a country where the arms port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a weapon, I find this totally schizophrene and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
Well those at this school just don't agree with the authorization to carry weapons in the USA!
The use of the pencil is still suicidal.
Stop screwing around: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids play with guns made at this age in our home?
Does that make them powerful murderers anyway?
Even though the weapon port is in the U.S. constitution and it necessarily affects the culture of the country, I do not believe that rich children are significantly different from ours.
A little good sense and good reason kept svp.
It's a disarming process!
Make sure you've been locked up!
The information on this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually has, or does not at all, a taste for morbidity.
Could we start from the principle that a serial killer can't already have a weird behavior at the age of 5?
If people need a psy follow-up, it's more the mabula in this school than the students!
Let the parents take their kid out of there: she's in danger!
I totally agree.
Those who run this school are obviously completely ill.
Your reaction is most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the United States but is a part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
It's about youth?
These gorgeous blue coasters that men wear have nothing to do with an entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson lead at the beginning of their career?
In their first pictures, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a rolled collar sweater.
I can't comment too much since I've never looked at this, but everything seemed so boring and soulless.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Opposite, maybe?
But what does that look like?
You're ahead of me.
I'd have thought a slight knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying "ostracize," he meant "alienate."
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar was wearing a gray suit, we could advance that their intention was to ostracize him.
But here, no.
It looks like it's been corrected – weird. Maybe the whole sentence has been invented!
It's not weird.
haha, who knows what he could have said?
It's probably nothing, but someone wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was "ostrace", which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States has still fallen out, about 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Gas prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, continues to strengthen itself.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become "sustainable"?
To live there at the moment, I will say that the United States is gradually closing in on the explosion as inequality becomes insane.
The political system is literally corrupted by the state of funding for electoral campaigns.
Racial tension, police violence, mass incarceration have an extent that is not imagined in Europe but Americans keep incredible optimism in the future of their country and their own!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago the English financial media said France was lost.
Now, it's the American who's at the end of his scroll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of these articles that simply forgets the essentials.
The level of consumption in the US economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and billboards can't give the change for a long time yet...
On the basis of the depletion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and the poorest, a very large majority of the citizens, will "trick" or rather morph.
I can't blame this Ferrage.
Will the Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing sympathetic voters from abroad makes him lose even more support at home?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continues with Russia.
Shameful performance of the Labour, Ed Milliband is in the moose, it's played at 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's massive immigration policy was designed "to fill the right nose in diversity"
The Labour wins the by-election, the Tories lose the by-election in safe siege against ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same Multiculturalism that leads to this maneuvering return, the pendulum has spread far since the end of the war, and I imagine that now it will go in the other direction.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Labour Security Headquarters, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for Labour it is a victory at Pyrrhus.
Look for the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used argumentatively against the word "defeat", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a victory, but she's thin.
The Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like this in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent to whatever wins in 2015 as soon as Lib Dems are not here.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know about the ice in Canada, Greenland and northern Russia.
On the other hand, I wonder whether the alignment of Venus and March etc should not be considered as well?
In general, we need to see the Earth more "paste" or malleable than we can imagine.
Is that so?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us of a "simply simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the earth's crust, the pressure on the coat relaxes, which gives/would give a) a whipping to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ????
In any case, either "knocking" or facilitating access to the area will be located (more or less).
Difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa As for climate warming, it seems prudent to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, Patricedusud, does this volcano have an effect on our environment?
Does it have an effect on our climate warming, future or past?
Isn't Prudence no longer warming up?
When complexity cannot be resolved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's dark, we see less well.
Hello, the end of the last glacier period was also accompanied by a stronger seismic activity, particularly in the "active" mountain range where on the highly Englished continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
CB cordially
Too often it is unknown that the earth’s crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon causes it to ascend or descend from about 30 to 60 cm, in deferring, following its passage to the Zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This leads to the smoothing of tectonic plates, as well as tides, being more or less facilitated by this moving drill, especially since the polar caps are reduced by the melting of the ice, thus causing a change in the equilibrium of the land to the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am am am amused by this "human", the supreme of nature and its self-proclaimed commander, to mock by his stupid action on the environment that created it and of which it has become so separate that it has become harmful, and to itself and to this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this nature that overcomes him in the organization of his very viscerals, by an invention that consists of finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, one another, mocking collaboration, money.
The earth’s crust is not based on magma, but on the earth’s mantle, which is made of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at him.
Pretentious and arrogant.
This reminds me of Ascent of Man from Bronowski.
Lively the next part.
Beautiful Wild1 story
Rather, it reminds me of a totally brilliant 2002 series called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers now.
Too bad you never get past the first impression.
Your loss...
"The ice creams, our distant ancestors" You should look again at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you Brian
I am almost sure that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been carried out several times, they always go to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I don't support this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes all the way to Ethiopia to pretend to make a bug eyes in front of a brain in a mouth.
And his narration...
It must be hard for you to watch Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, that says.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be self, in itself, therefore not-conformity.
Sure, but Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and its intellectual questioning expresses this advent.
But at that time it is just the premises that appear, today individualism structures the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass" !!!
Without making it an independable horizon, is there not any relation with the Cartesian approach to examine what we receive to believe, what we believe to be self.
More than rebellion, doubt is fertile.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter – reform!
By placing the problem at the level of its paranoia, he blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reducing and reactionary vision that supports: Behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right about this point and is anti-conformist, it is to fight against this decelebration.
We blame Marcel Gauchet for being an order defender.
Excellent idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, ask some...
Blacks and boars, the others.
Beaufs and robots, they include the most followers of those who see themselves in their mirror.
In any case, thanks to his controversial contestators for putting Marcel Gauchet, this humanist patient and persistent, and so educationally enlightening.
David Cameron supports the increase in inheritance tax threshold
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will greatly increase its net value once he is no longer in power.
Business advice, talks, consultation fees, a series of best-sellers written by a negro on "serious policy" – it will be £100 once it has passed the weapon to the left.
Of course, he doesn't want any inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as in the last election?
And the richest are those who will certainly pay the least inheritance tax thanks to super well paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
It'll be £100 once he passes the gun to the left.
Anything.
He's probably going to promise to raise the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say it's worth.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Do you also think that Brown thought only of his own heirs, or are you just a no-brain tribalist?
We didn't elect him the last time, we had a coalition in place.
You could only allow yourself to accuse him of lying if he was actually elected to power.
Like the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally".
Climate change and imminent collapse will end it, him and the others of his end.
His "richness" will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeded £1,000 billion.
We must all be charged to pay the essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I do not say that the discipline didactic is unnecessary, of course, I say that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "inadequacies".
That's an unreasonable statement for the math teacher she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class has no other approach than quantitative.
There are 2 possible answers, 1st would be to select teachers based on their ability to transmit knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to establishing a disability relationship that causes everyone to suffer in pure loss => it requires 1 training skills to teach.
A craft that learns, of course.
But teaching is first of all an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not making car parts.
The pedagogy doesn't get into equation even when we're math teachers!
The "sciences of education" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently missing is a real vocation at bcp of those who embrace the teacher
If gifts exist, teaching (I prefer didactic discipline) allows those who are less comfortable not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective question.
The true unknown today are the students who say 1/3: learning is no good for anything I already know what I think.
A Slate article quite well describes the chaotic situation of this return.
Let's regret the old Normal Schools of Institutes..
It ends at 3 o'clock in the morning from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If it's any way it suits his time.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't suit me!
It's been years since her show started at midnight.
We have this thing that's called playing and that allows us to listen to on demand whenever we want it!
The internet is pretty incredible, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at home, I can't really listen to radio programs either.
I have a USB-type adapter behind my SKY box and which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seemed too complicated.
Yeah, I think I got wrong on the schedule, I had to hear Richard Lester at about three hours.
Although it's men on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her antenna schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least that would make people happy.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its show is anything sensational disguised in debate, and it would be much better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of the regular cheerleaders, Chris Evans in the morning at Simon May's show on the evening when the job returns, is not a woman
It's five.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows very well, but doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detachable of these times.
Jeremy Vine may be returned to the offices as a true journalist, but lunch keeps all the glacial air of a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine it's quiet, waiting for the current team to get bored or get fired.
I was born in Soismos in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for FN.
For 40 years we have had the same parties that alter the power and make the country's keys to each other in less good than they have taken.
The countryside is very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with further isolation.
It takes miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gym, a theatre.
But since they don't burn cars, they don't attack, they don't delate, they don't interest politicians...
But thank you don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes,Doclocal, they are under-men, sociology is good to look at them.
They have very high rates of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The FN thrives on human stupidity, inculturity and ignorance as much as saying that it still has enormous growth potential, it really needs to be bad for not doing better...
Today, the FN thrives mainly on poverty, fear of everyday life, fear of each other and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
What a terrible humanity.
Fortunately, there is a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and educated to save the honor.
They've been looking for him.
Take the voters for c...
That's what happens.
Who are they?
"forgetted" actually there is less and less resource =>lowing staffing.
This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen to you can't just "add and mix," women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by this is that in many developing countries, existing standards are challenged, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles.
This allows women to recognize that they can work in the economic sphere and that is great - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double scourge, that is, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to play their role as socio-reproductor.
I'm not convinced my sister.
Economics and profits do not recognize gender roles.
Money is talking, and if a sex isn't up to the next one!
The profits mock the life you lead.
What are you doing, what are the benefits and what do you have to offer?
The profits mock the heroism and the education of children.
If it was a crime, companies would listen.
Employer friends will never employ women between the ages of 20 and 45.
Well said, my sister.
It is very problematic that nobody talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (the majority of which is done by women) must be equivalent to more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive sufficient support and is undervalued (not to mention the fact that men do not do so enough), but it allows us to operate our societies and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a real "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to Msskayadee's point of view, how can we take account of disproportionately women's responsibilities when conducting gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he'll help a lot of people who have to "check a box."
The tiger is not Russian only of Western propaganda.
The Chinese alone are responsible for the current situation and would do better to sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger entitled to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are simply operating near the border, long-standing exercises prior to the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft in its possession.
Free the Tigrisan!
You make my day!
Oh, yeah, there you go.
He just came up with the same kind of idea.
This is a pretext that was found to arm a few separatists to attach China.
If Siberia's tiger is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, beautiful feline and in real danger of extinction turn into an article that ultimately leads against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is not a sheet on the Siberian tiger, but a sheet on the sequences of a Putin com operation.
When we expose ourselves to the media so much, we also expose ourselves to irony or even criticism.
The return of perpetual victimization of Soviet-Poutinian sympathizers.
Hollande had also taken the pear full of it with her camel without screaming in the anti-French plot.
There our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg Saint Protector of the Great Russia has personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understood everything, he broke up...
Let Holland get low, that's one thing.
At first sight, it seemed to be an awfully condescending idea.
But on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both an answer to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
So it's hard to find something to say.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed its teeth before, and 73% later, it's a little empty sense to complain about paternalism.
After all, there's no point in brushing your teeth!
Indeed - basically, complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted towards the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if this is true, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental subsidies offered by the Department of Labour and Revenue from the Ministry of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better means to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a drawback in brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and stiff, it can sting the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember an show on the Guinness book of records where someone had tried to brush his teeth longer and the Guinness judges at the time strongly advised him to do so because of the adverse effects of a frequent and prolonged tooth brush.
At first glance - very funny.
It seems to me to be a rotten experimental design.
The simple act of volunteering for this study would have changed the habits of participants who knew that toothbrush would be studied.
That's why most behavioural studies include things like double blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person who receives social benefits, there are two things that differ from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not provide feedback on when they brush or brush their teeth (effects easily fucked up by people who give their results based on perceived expectations).
Are there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including the uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited traits could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterus graft impact this phenomenon?
Nidation itself looks like some kind of transplant.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we do not want to bring about an impossible perfect clone of ourselves, is a problem a priori?
It seems to me that it is going beyond the limit of reasonableness.
The desire for motherhood and paternity should not move forward further, without asking the question of ethics, risk taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, it is not without limits and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they want to have.
This has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the tran
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go up to risk taking and manage your little testicles to yourself alone, alone in your little pants alone.
from their "confer" this magic bag so they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him in my safe if he could still give love.
The current harsh circumstances make the FRYDMAN PR prudent about its communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
What's going to put ns as an anti argument: cf here these all male reactions curiously....
Marjane, any organ donation has nothing to do with it.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not completely anodized.
I had been registered as a donor of spinal cord (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and this is understood for both the receiver and the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not be able to judge in one way or another or to take part in this gift, but I will listen to the women to talk about it.
@Margane: Actually, this has nothing to do with it, and it reinforces the act of love that it involves.
Giving a kidney to a member of his family who needs it does not have any anodin either, and that is done!
Please, do not mix Messi v Ronaldo.
It's down.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially since there's really no competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
Sports has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for Monday, but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team.
Thank you for fixing me.
But Rivaldo played well for Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all the Real Madrid record goals this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a quiet conscience...
I can't believe it.
I think Ronaldo will end his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was looking at him on a fucking connection so I can't tell you much if it's not that Valencia has defended well and without counting possession, they deserve to win.
I was afraid the middle of the land would not get too fast, but they played well.
Parejo's whole game becomes better.
A terrible penalty freed but just saved by Diego.
A Mestalla with a shaky atmosphere and it shouldn't have been funny for Atletico's bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the origins of mummification", well illustrated, appeared in the magazine Archaeology 524 last September.
It's good to have arguments to confirm and give what we intuitively guess.
No wonder before we made it complicated, we made it simple.
All science progresses by small steps.
And the "organ" of the woman who was thus preserved was?
Fascinating!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me to read a few times ago that a mummy of black children had been discovered in current Libya and that this discovery had opened new horizons, especially geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mummy was prior to the first known African mummies 1,000 years).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you in advance.
She's a little uncomfortable with reading.
These may not be modern-day contaminations.
Was the desert at that time not extending any further than now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis growing to the place where there is only sand now?
We know the song.
And it is enough that a European scholar asserts it, even without any evidence, to make it a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it is not and always "from his ill-known ancestors".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal free market quacks that preach against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are others who are affected by Ebola and who the Spanish government is lying to us, not to give themselves a bad picture and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same with regard to tourism, but the right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about lack of transparency.
Even though I think that the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good at nothing and corrupt, like Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt it's their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allows millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say, yes, it is important.
If they were to send the missionaries back, I don't see why they couldn't send them to an air military base and care for them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy's mission was to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is its basis for power, until the courts intervene.
It's nothing but a right-wing man in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's fucked up in the next elections.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he is far from his right and would well find his place to the religious fools on the right in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had previously come down to try to achieve his goal that is to protect Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European party right to the Spanish right.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government is talking about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not succeed.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE patrons - SMEs seem to read Le Monde to take the time to condemn the words of Fr.
Let's move on to the anti-intellectualism of the surrounding era.
A professor of law at the College of France seems unable to know the labour market unless he is a Nobel Prize in Economics and proposes to liberalize it completely
It was so much better before, that's true when Dr. Villermé noticed the work of 8-year-olds 10-hour-day-olds, when Canuts were taking a look at themselves because of a collective agreement signed.
Ah the good old time...
Your reaction is just as fascinating because of your lack of knowledge of the TPE employer's trade!
His job is not to know the right in all his masters, but to manage and produce.
Four manuscript amounts inscribed on my youth salary bulletin, more than 100 information today!
Here is an example, one could mention much more, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, imposed without measure of consequences, and which choke the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a client of the Sorbon.
As a result of the archi-ressassisted argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code in relation to helvette, a serious academic would have plunged into the Swiss texts and would have compared the quantity of official texts, then that of the comments (the absence of the latter that could mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
For comments in a Code, whether it's work or not, it's aimed at jurisprudence in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is fired, for example....
Who's complicated?
Do you think that the rule of law (laws, jurisprudence, conventions, contracts) is in terms of work and trade of unbearable barriers?
What's he doing?
How long does that last?
Pullmann "Art has practically been immunized against criticism Mrs.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It is certainly time for new revolutionary absurdities to shake the criticisms...
For every Ai Weiwei article I've read recently, you are part of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Come on, move on!
Go see elsewhere, the choice is not missing in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists that are not spokespersons of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen of the communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think that the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraud, here's what you miss.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but I had to expose him at all costs (without making a bad word).
It's the guy who bursts out of the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There is art, and then vandalism is trying to attract attention.
True artists make a difference.
A beautiful artist.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy to occupy an elective mandate the extremists of any board (including Zionists) must be set aside
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have served him several judicial convictions, shame both Israel and Neuilly's mayorate.
He doesn't represent either.
Philippe Karsenty fights the truth alone, marginally.
WHAT IS COMMITTED TO BE LIKE
What does Neuilly City Hall intend to do against Philipe Karsenty, who insults a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls upon him to attack this urbanist?
Crime acology?
I can't find Neuilly on my card?
Is there a new administration that holds these new privileges???
This guy needs care, just like Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the anti-Jewish/Anti-Israel conspiracy theory and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most furious detractors.
As many people believe in any political decision to see the hand of the "sionists" (the term whose meaning tends to disappear, due to its abuse), these two there, in the same title as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe in any criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism "which is not without recalling the darkest hours of our history because it is still fertile the belly of the beast my good lady would believe to return to Russia of the 19th century!".
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the plot on September 11 are of a terrible stupidity.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the conspiracy theory of September 11, we talk about cognitive dissonance regarding how to address the subject.
Totally blinded by a completely farfetched truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support it, it is impossible to adapt this theory to stand out (as in the case of extreme religious ones).
It follows a logical and inescapable flight forward, the end justifies all means, even lies, which is a complicity, but filly does not seem to disturb the mission of the individual.
You advise to be careful and not put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you do for September 11.
There is still a bunch of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudi/Consorts do not seem to be in a hurry to answer them.
There are actually very farfetched theories, but the official theory is also so, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need even more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its hour of judgment when the real harm it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is rising," but what requires (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you think this is an attack - are you going to have a drink and relax?
It's better to risk this than to put my mental health at risk by abstinence.
The Government is putting an end to the pleasures when it costs him money.
Here are other alarm advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two average glasses per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies that it is more or less safe.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Council for Health and Medical Research should cooperate (around one or two drinks, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now, we're going to tax them thoroughly, like the smokers!
They're already doing it - soon it'll be grass!
My father didn't drink and he didn't smoke, and cancer took him to 64.
So I will continue to drink my two bottles of red on Friday and Saturday evenings (and the other nights when my wife is not here).
Why does the Cancer Council encourage children to go to places where alcohol is used It is an old-fashioned fact that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to the risk of cancer today ????
Sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
He refuses to run when we could run and reciprocate.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessed yes.
Both of them destroyed the F1 on the pretext of security.
Let's hope it gets better than Schumi or less Wendlinger was his accident in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but focus on point 1: it is not the F1, but the instances of the circuit that refused to advance the departure to avoid magnifying TV broadcasters.
Totally accurate, +1
I just want to wish Jules Bianchi a quick and prompt recovery!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that almost occurred between cranes and f1 were cost-free warnings.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had said so for years.
How the hell did the race organization and the AIF allow these maneuvers without leaving the safety because?
I can't accept that we invoke the risks of the job or the lack of a chance when we haven't stopped the predictable.
But that was the accident.
It must also be said, however, that there was a yellow flag, which not only means "a ban on exceeding the area" but is intended to signal a danger for the first time.
It's not shameful, it's fortunate for the family that was supposed to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just raise their feet.
Under changing conditions, the shift can be much more trapping the next round and the pilot, believing to arrive with sufficient margin, can even be "reduced" speed compared to a normal rhythm.
But, well, we cause in the vacuum there, until we've seen the images, we can't make a written opinion.
I don't see much of what this changes.
Are there any wounded?
According to CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the info this morning before this happens, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe there are still jobs where we have to be on duty 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are people injured since Canada is almost empty.
There may be wounded animals like bears, working mice, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population densities in North America and Toronto has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan countryside, trains do not derail by charm and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains travel very, very often in a day.
In addition, as the pathways often follow watercourses in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass through densely populated areas, because people always want to live near the water.
Also, all rail traffic crosses the center of a city as it was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have been trying to be funny, but there is enormous potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge reported on it last night, really shocking.
Did you obviously not read the article about the derailment and explosion of a train in a city of Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city long before the railway.
However, when the railways were constructed, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps Canadian National Railway Corporation employees are expected to attend the next Hazardous Products Conference in Calgary in Canada on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees are long trained in the transport of hazardous products.
This article, as many comments make the impasse on the primary religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there cannot be any other truths.
All the problem is there and the exegesis of theologians only reinforces this fact, otherwise what is good to talk about the sex of angels?
"God said: it's good - it's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
The word of a leader (Muslim countries but not of importance): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?"
In other words: obey the priest pastor rabbi imam and make your prayers, it will be better!
Reported below, (Nowak): pb settled in 1905 after 40 years of fight against curators.
May His Appendix Nouillesque touch you.
Yes, this is what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in a certain way trying to establish a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the strong Euro ( rather at the moment ) or that of the free market ( particularly supported by the state when it is necessary to float ) ,etc .
Great ideas from religious emergence.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is at the trailer and expresses himself in the schism.
Religion was born as an ideological support of the state, and gods served ambitions even though it also carried forms of challenge.
The theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the airs of time knew no doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a bad interpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts which are filled with explicit calls to hate the believer.
Rather, it is the moderate religious (and fortunately the most numerous) who read the texts "wrongly" and retain only what belongs to humanism and values common to all humanity, atheists and various believers.
For me, fanaticism is the foolish and evil application of passages of sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, certain verses of the Qur'an calling for the killing of "unbelievers", "infidels", "hypocrits", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if one does not read a few verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in situations of legitimate defence.
on Yves Petit :" concerning the "foulard", it is a religious prescription that makes today almost unanimous in the "savants".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive thing to do is that this led to a general conviction.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same harm as the one shown in the clip?
Overpaid and hypersexualized band of Neanderthals.
They have offended humanity enough!
What have they brought to us frankly besides having offended us with Neighbors, For Life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anying - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Tasman Devil and this satanist Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you took your eyes off TV for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, beginning with paintings in caves and stone made by its indigenous peoples and that are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful songs such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealander, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me be of another opinion.
Sox does not need any help under this heading.
How could I have guessed that it would be a "small white"!
Another fan of George Lazenby.
How do you do?
But what about married Jego?
The largest foreign journalist based in Moscow.
The most brilliant.
His articles are cruelly lacking.
It understands whether Putin and those who support it.
Let's go see Leviathan at the cinema, you'll understand a lot of things!!
Nice effort Savantcosi!
But you don't know yet that Kastals is just a little Moscow telegraphist who only has to do with his days.
We leave him for a month and when we come back he's debiting the same salads.
Almost all of the 331 deaths since the cease-fire are civilians of the Donbass who are victims of military bombings, due to uncontrollable elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritically suggested responsibilities in the article without daring to designate explicitly the separatists is in the octanesque line of the World that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the pro-European neo-Nazis bravely facing the wicked Russians
@SavantCosinus: change browser.
I open this page very well on firefox and mac.
If I understand your words well the wicked are the Ukrainians and the Gentiles the Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a bit communist by chance
Extract from the (very long) document you quoted about MH17: "this ticket is absolutely not meant to say that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent."
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
Propaganda?
At Alexandre Kastals: where do you keep these clarifications about the macabre count?
From the Ukrainian army (it unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Uncontrolled elements (possible to say anything)?
ALLEEEEEYEY TO RUMANIA!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez in Hungary!
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That said, I can't support Piturca's team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the powers in place that has not stopped denigrating Romanian football until the pathetic level it has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperative", which decided before the beginning of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which would whiten the money at its own will, mainly by selling players who were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was doing business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about EUR 1 million), then paid them, but apparently he was badly advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have cost him a sentence without a penalty), and therefore took three and a half years in prison.
The trial also took place from prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, star manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali also purifies himself a penalty for trying to bribe (and then conceal the facts) a team for her to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last game of the championship, to be able to win the title and win the League of Champions jackpot.
The team he tried to blow were our neighbors at Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be Cluj's first champions, while they were relegated.
I'm always so happy at this moment.
In the concealment of this attempted corruption was involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed a false document as a witness that implied that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So that poor uneducated, idiot, cheater and liar doesn't represent me, and never will.
Hungarians are just a band of nationalistic idiots today.
You might think that after the last time they broke stadium chairs and shop windows, and where they branded racist flags in their streets, they couldn't have tickets this time, but no.

Super article.
If it was Sarkozy who did this, we would have heard the left cry like a big sick man.
But since it's nice Hollande, friend of trade unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but it's all low.
That is why the economic community sometimes prefers that a party claiming to be left in power.
They are the bankers who financed Obama's victory, and they haven't given up their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers do not seek work" LOL (no comment)
Should the employment hub generalize the control of unemployed early 2015?
I hope that in the wake of the fiscal pole, it will also generalize the absolute control of gougnafers commonly called plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrates, tax evasion, stealing patterns, and other malandrins.
Can you make a sentence without the words banksters or plutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
That's true when we have class: we treat the population of bedbugs and toothless
At each new unemployment period, there are tens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who are most often not even charged with an acknowledgement of receipt, were automated.
It is also the total lack of follow-up or support from the Pole Employment.
To conclude, I will add that this government's "socialist" patronship appears to me as an insult to Jaurès or Mendès France's memory.
Have we read here an article of the chained duck?
It is learned that a unemployed person may remain without news from his agency for several months, but that he must continue to seek jobs by his own means.
It has been learned that controls have resulted in the removal of persons who for more than half had no unemployment benefit.
So we wonder how people can be controlled that we never see.
It is questioned what sanctions are for anyone who does not have access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if it can be admitted that this reform will allow for further radiation, we wonder how it will help recruits.
"It is learned that a unemployed person may remain for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to seek jobs by his own means" It is indeed shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's ideals?
Is it not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in football either?
Should they be driven out of the EU?
The EU was the only economic source and should remain.
The goal is not to be a "police of thoughts".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It has no economic significance.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality???
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the referees of the corrupt mafia that is UEFA.
The best solution would be that all East leaves this lucrative organization rot and created its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This antiracism crusade is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Currency and trade, rather.
European ideals of equality?
What the hell is Europe doing to let the United Kingdom in?
Uefa should applaud them for playing Blatter's comedy and his men.
This has been happening all over the world for a few years, and I am not exaggerating.
Pulled from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he have hoped to see small symmetrical phrases twist, just history of maintaining the controversy?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there was, there are and there will be people working to throw oil on the fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli and that this alone explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
Decoding would be to say that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, action should be taken against the overarmed Israeli identity state occupying the siege of oppressive colonialist oppressor
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was not at all in the Shoah, it was more reasonable to empty the Bavarian German inhabitants (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been fair, Germans had nothing to claim and Europe would have kept millions of educated, enterprising and dynamic people.
Mr. Consider the example of Western Sahara colonization...
Let Morocco be the colonialist, it's obvious!
But as for Israel, it is also necessary to question history, its allies and support to interview truths.
Colonialism, no matter what it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
Gaul was colonized by the Romans but currently there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination based on origin.
Furthermore, the Israeli state defines itself as that of a "Jewish people" whose no non-Jewish people can be part of.
The Israeli State discriminates against non-Jewish people, hence the contentious one.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break with Zionism that opposes Jews and non-Jewish people.
In Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized by the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that need to be stopped ignoring.
First, the European Zionist project (colonizing Palestine) involved deposing Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needs to be broken with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has failed to bite from the start.
Their terne result will give them what their fingers are about to bite.
It should begin its rehabilitation by small plugs.
I hope he hasn't lost the appetite for the game.
We tolerate so much suddenness, including racial insults and physically hard heels in football, but we sanctioned Suarez too hard.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what Purists say.
Yeah, I hate all those molars.
Football is a contact sport where the stages exist and, therefore, players get hurt.
Getting his teeth into the flesh of an opponent for the benefit certainly does not have its place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for having committed a similar gesture.
It's the third time Suarez does this.
If you bite someone at work.
What would the consequences be for you?
I knew someone was gonna die.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this two-ball sarcasm.
I bet he was looking forward to a full-tooth play.
All these words games about Suarez are losing their bite.
I almost died in the ham.
An essential condition for a good school course is the respect of the students of their teachers and the school institution.
This works if parents instill respect for their children.
Parents convey this respect more easily if they also feel respected by their children's teachers and schools.
In good establishments, those who progress their students, parents are regarded as partners, not as emms.
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do the whole job (teaching, educating, learning respect, limits, living together briefly) It is parents to do at least 50% of the tap.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Focusing on parents is not operational.
No one really took on them.
The action will therefore remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could have a lot of things.
Operational and resident solutions.
It would be necessary for actors (profiles, hierarchies and departments) to play their role and do not always reach out.
We can disband a troop that breaks apart to relaunch it, not families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the primary role of the school.
Transmitting knowledge.
And if there's a requirement for parents, it's the school that provides education for their children.
What is the minister who dares to restore what was called the Public Instruction?
Disappointing article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Did you really expect an intelligent comment from this beautiful suburban East?
It's a beauty, it's clear, but I think it's rather Willoughby, and so from the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budgetary emergency.
Let him fall and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
purely true
That's right.
A little boy from Aloysius.
His electorate is Sydney North.
Indeed, a beauty of the North Coast!!!
Well, if British BBC viewers want to compare the neo-conservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
It's going to be a grunt from today. :(
Yeah, but his leader leaves him on a regular basis about his hunger.
You'd be rather squeaky too if you woke up one morning and realized that you'll never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these licit and illegal life benefits will forever remain out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He tried half of his budget and then quit.
At least he doesn't threaten to hit someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and call for state aid.
And as she knows how to lobby, there's no fear of the result.
And so much pis for employment in France she has nothing to do, which emanates from vegetables always ready to break when their corporation has losses on the markets, especially outdoors...
it's just because their lobbying didn't work because the command was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the time limit or an arrangement for marpol, no doubt the project would have been completed.
After that, to know whether it's good or not and how BF is going to comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice if "the world" was looking at it!
Brittany Ferries is owned by Breton vegetables.
Those who burn tax and drought centers.
They want state aid.
That they didn't seem to me to be normal.
And well to the extent that he armed a ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes it's normal to wait a inch from the state.
Or it is condemned to tolerate British monopolizing the market.
It's the choice.
Eternal French problem that considers its maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where sometimes people different from the average Parisian live.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-lived.
One of the reasons why Britain must regain its sovereignty.
This is and after they will create the Breton Pavilion with crews exclusively composed of pure strain bretons.
With this, they're sure they're going to drop costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They always hated everything that was related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which was always closer to Genesis's spirit of the 1970s than those of other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel’s solo work either.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of "hate everything related to prog", since they just broadcast an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career that would be "closer to the mind Genesis of the 70's", I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a lot of Genesis songs on which he had various degrees of participation and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour does not have the right to gather a bunch of demos in half finished and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett is asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely great, and quite in the mind of Genesis of the 1970s.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she fears.
Yes, it is one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been made if they had not had their commercial pop success in the 1980s?
I still haven't seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have such an interesting story but lacks the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good remarks.
I would still say that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it adores progressive music over time.
A person with a personal interest screams "prejudice": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a stunning success.
There will always be a difference in size between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his misconception of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so from the fairest and wisest vision and reflection of a society.
I mean, they don't have an excuse.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time.
That is precisely the difference, Mr LeClos.
We must have a good spirit of dispute about the common mortals in order to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has done since his distorted understanding of things.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, revenge among the innocent victims' relatives: a false understanding that can never be used by those who wisely decide the death of others since the healthy and just reasoning of their pedestal.
However, to try to balance the analysis, it could be argued that the death penalty, often, has exercised savage violence, which he has enjoyed, against land-friendly people, who have made the costs free of charge.
Those close to these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain mitigated with the disappearance of the one who was the assailant, sometimes the torturer, of being loved and haunting their nights.
Let us not despise their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this thought that I find very fair.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he shows great intelligence.
The one in the heart.
That's probably what I've read more just for a long time.
However, one would think that we read stories of another era, of ancient things, that the barbarism of the past would excuse, and then here are the dates that call, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is so great.
The same applies to the other two "Excellent American novelists" mentioned here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all over it.
I thought you'd stopped the white guy.
What's that all about?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than this terrible Bellow, who received the prize.
Perhaps this year's Nobel judges decided that if we had to have an American winner, we could have a racist [light].
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "geny novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homonymous Joseph on the other hand...
Which one did you read?
How many books from DeLillo did the anti-DeLillo read?
I never finished Underworld, but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, crazier, smaller novels and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'll ever end Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be conflict...??
It's of simple interest.
It was a trait of humor, "the law", not a request for definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems so EVIDENT here that the lady acted in sole interest, and absolutely not in the institution she represented, that one wonders what the term "conflict" is doing.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope it'll be very expensive!
Yes, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not prevented it from danger.
After that we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and seek only tranquility.
The flood zones that become constructive from day to day when a major construction program starts, it's classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at alluvial plains near the rivers.
We were told that "now there are no more flooding thanks to the regulatory dams."
Now you need to enlarge the retention lakes upstream and cross your fingers.
But it will be because of state services, of course...
On-the-spot profit, on the whole promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is the interest clearer here?
Exit the calculator and you will dream of life that you could have been in place of Mrs. Babin, 1st Deputy UMP of La Faute sur Mer and former Chair of the Urban Commission, who grants them permission to build!
The 2 mothers of Sarkozysme triumphant are the old and real estate.
I am on the left and not at all sympathetic with Sarko, but svp, not low political or low blows all Azimuth, we are not in there in a battle of stinking balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
U.S. cops are hardened criminals.
The US is a shithole.
So what fucking hole are you in?
The U.S. isn't a shithole.
Yes, U.S. cops are hardened because of the roots they deal with on a daily basis.
Of course none of them ever do anything but the cops "come to piss them off because they're racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, it is unfortunate that there is an incident like this to force people to see the problem closer.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You're unaware of him here.
Good cops must denounce corrupt racist cops.
Sell them!
Do the math.
There is no such thing as open racism here.
Is this your first time in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant when in fact it's clearly you who aren't asking for anything - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem of racism in the United States (that's not ear speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent to which the tension is rising at this time.
And therefore, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances NYPD in different ways, from which Occupy's treatment there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and shocks me the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think investigative journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interrogate those responsible, make them talk, raise confidence.
That Man goes to Elysée doesn't really have anything surprising.
Then, what counts is the replication, the verification, the analysis.
And here we understand that sarcoles have a concern to do.
@Munstead, our current president was elected on a wave of anti-sarkozysm based on business issues raised from all parts (a non-place and no conviction) which appear to have been concocted by magistrates (2 references in correction), two Dutch friends journalists.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executives and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, your partisan spirit blinds you!
RV with Hollande ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and unguided !!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's support is unworthy!
From the extract I could read, VA's article only rubs the sprinkler.
I even laughed so rude.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chance of outcome because journalists are not "strained" at source's secret, are they?
Unlike the fact that there does not seem to be any conniving between VA and power while there seems to be conniving between the power and the journalists of the world for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one to wait for an explanation of the world on the substance and its dangerous relations.
We are well in the face of a state scandal which in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
From this edition to the Abois, which says a long story about complicity with the current government.
It's not a left or right question, it's more serious.
I'd have thought the bean would be good with the smoked herring!
It is simply for figures and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I was a second generation immigrant whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about immigration but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration program was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people who came in and the changes they brought with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all cooperative, even refusing to give soup crumbs simply because of the lady's religion, he also refused to enter his place of worship although she told him that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she was NOT comfortable"
As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - whoever imposes limits and challenges it must be admired even if it is a director of pub:) So much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were lefter, it would be communist.
What do you think the New Labour has done, particularly on the left?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS repeats, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms to cover well the nose of the right in), the culture of social benefits, the age of all-est-permit, the politically correct that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that the Labour is a centre left and not a communist, I said this to joke, what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Let your arguments be prepared as much as you want, but what I asked you, are specific examples of Gaussian policy, or a left-wing program defended by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour was doing, which is particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah - it's Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants who are now coming to Britain?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
S"we fought in 40 45 to fall into another dispatch, that of money.
We'll make pretty savings by turning these technocrats...
The treaties should be renegotiated.
Either, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" has yet another meaning in Europe, should this do so?
Interestingly, the Commission does not address the unfair tax competition between countries facing companies.
This must be negligible.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully market.
In term, this means that whole pangs of French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment of many territories will only strengthen.
Any sacrifice, including the avant-garde of a country, on behalf of the Liberal Doxa did not seem to me to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will need to be dealt with one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to make the SNCF accounts clear.
The French state has long resigned.
The regions have the impression that they pay for nothing, but not the means of forcing the sncf to comply with its commitments.
But using public money without waste is essential to these days when public resources are being forced.
And the huge needs.
I don't see very well what might be the competition of TERs!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that is the case, should he certainly not be head of cattle?
It seems to me that you have not really been able to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, still coming to the end of pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would make sense to initiate the process of separation between your life and the complications you inherited.
Looks like it's what they're doing, but it looks hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new ones surface, have you thought about a "run" plan so that you can make a cut between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a compatible real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
He seems vindicative and persistent.
Why not go to a family advisory group to say things openly and to provide support to help her get back to work and pay for food.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice no matter what.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will handle the disappointment if he does not keep his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see you do this for their good, despite your own resentment because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do all you can to facilitate a parent/child relationship, they will know who will thank you when they are older.
I am of the opinion that children end up understanding who is wrong, if we let them see things by themselves.
Another little effort you are close to Godwin point.
In 30 to 40 years, civilization has disappeared, short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the iron pot.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that makes the least so-called social, fiscal but also environmental has an immediate competitive advantage, and the others are obliged to follow.
All policies are looking for growth, La Croissance.
International coordination should be required, but by this time ...
It is not the climateoscopics that produce C02.
It is everyone who is warmer, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in the homes that he had to build, those who buy industrial products that he had to produce and transport.
It's not the climaoscetics that have shown against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climate-septic and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climate-septics emit more CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders also move for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be enough.
Political action is also needed (other sources of energy, reducing car dependence, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensibilities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is in fact a famous McArtur promise made on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator only resumed the expression.
But good it may be humorous to say that the expression is Terminator.
" greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but any good apostle of the RCA dogma seems to know what it is about.
Nobody knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Bingo du Guardian: How long before anyone makes a mistake about immigration?
I blame the crap that took all the money.
Do we count Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm asking for my $5.
I blame the liars of Democrats.
Or the crooks of Democrats.
Or the Labour liars.
We don't care, they're responsible.
The displacement of populations could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump into a car or aircraft to escape the epidemic only move the infection faster than they can imagine.

Don't use the word immigration, you're going to scare the horses!
The United Kingdom is dependent on immigration to pay all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their hygienic basins, to bury the 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger (don't forget your wool and goodness, which allow you to warm up, turn off the heating and eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be such a jerk.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will lead Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a joke, or is it not a joke?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is wasted to allow a tiny minority of individuals to spend good time in space doing chickens and snoring while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
The television reality has therefore not invented anything and the authorities are sure to expect a baby to be designed up there to ignite the world and to reverse media coverage to the Western royalties used to tabloid maternity.
Maybe they should come down to earth and see that we're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, we don't send men or women into space to make chickens or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for mankind in general.
And that, in all areas.
A lot of things that improve our daily lives are derived from space research.
So yes, it's money spent usefully.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily life and results from space research.
It's just a cash waffle.
the ball pen that works the tip in the air (for example, to write to the ceiling)
To pay for his treats?
To participate in the manufacture of an essential product?
Or propose how to make more money to investors?
In short, working for work means nothing to say and represents emptiness itself.
Ah, if the last one played high tech.
Behind the tiny minority of individuals who go into space, there are tens of thousands of others who work to make it possible.
You know, people who are working on what, including more and more private companies, in particular to drive the cargo to the station.
If you think you're buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think they're buying plastic guns now but who have the potential to buy plastic guns in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to deceive people to make them think it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, it would have hurt the author/editor to put a picture of the "sword" in question instead of generic pictures of "plastic swords"?
Or even to be curious enough to wonder what the inscription (if any) meant to be on it?
Typical misreporting, it's late on the fact that "it's just a plastic sword" and not on the inspiring jihadi text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
Dirani's family, on the other hand, is Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, and terrorist groups seeking to overthrow governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped arguing about the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be deadly.
Even the small blankets given in the fast remains can pierce the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifies the ridiculous thing the author gives it.
It is not worth trying to make a "ha, ha, a plastic sword", the facts as you have stated them actually support its argument.
I saw these decorative objects on occasion in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it makes all the sense now...
I saw this guy who seemed to be from the Middle East in Kebab Stop and was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night long!
I really like the conclusion.
All the wonderful new developments, often technological, suggest to many people that it is a right and a need to benefit from them, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a flat cost (subscription, electrical consumption) that weighs in budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies leads to frustration.
For example, use of the Solidarity Energy Pact, which allows the insulation of the filles of a house for a symbolic €1 when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are borne by the energy providers in fact!).
Simple but unknown though more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting about this PES.
But never heard of it.
Who can call it and how does it work?
For information 60 million consumers, test water saving showers and recommend the placing of water saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 / year to 100 m3) by 50 m3 of water savings per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
This is not a demand crisis, it is a system crisis that can no longer produce enough surplus (which would then have been redistributed in the form of real income increase) so that these surpluses pay the increase of the expenses you classify in the "compulsory expenditure" category.
In other words, energy precariousness is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy can no longer grow as quickly as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is completely incapable of answering such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element that could, increasingly decades after decade, constrain the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (physically), energy is what makes any physical transformation possible.
Since producing, fundamentally, is transforming, energy is the means to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy needs.
This means that any upward constraint on energy generation (properly called "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn forcing production to increase (except to improve energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency always requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy precariousness and the fact that we arrive, or not, to increase the "production" of cheap energy.
And the data published very formally, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only worsen in the years and decades to come (the IEA, in these last reports, clearly indicates that in 2008 the peak of production of conventional oil, understood, is not expensive.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job regardless of performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring things back.
Take this to France!
Vote No 18.
Are you a Guardian webmaster?
As previously noted: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Yeah, nice work, guys.
Although many English people like to make fun of Scottish people when they just lose, there is no telling, they bring a little color to tournaments when they arrive to qualify, at least until they get eliminated in the first round.
It's even more ridiculous if we play against them;)
England is beginning to worry me.
Because now that the "goldish shige generation" retires, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole, and David Seamen back in the XI starting, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class", is David Beckham, a bit ephemeral, perhaps, but I think that if he was tacklain an overweight potato like me, he would crush me completely.
People forget its athletic constitution, by the way, speaking of athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never make fun of Scotland.
I tend to surprise myself by observing their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class" is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It is about which Juppe would have had a hard time asking for 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he would get them if he asked them...
You mean people are coming for a good shot?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, only lives on his deputies' allowances...
I would like to ask myself, above all, the question of what he can say in his lectures.
How to reduce its deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious lecturer of a scientific discipline, whatever its scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will not consider asking for the least amount.
Conferences with content are mostly free of charge or almost free of charge.
And I can assure you that these young people actually work and that the results presented in their conferences - for free - are real.
At the time of the research budget restrictions, the reporting of these two figures is encouraging.
Researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
It all lights up for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
I feel like he's being blamed for making money???
I am far from being one of his fans, but we blame him for having wrong (or fraudulently) running his campaign OK.
But making conferences seems to me to be quite legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let's remember that her travels are taken care of by taxpayers.
Rule 1 of Epidemiology: to isolate.
All American and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than politically correct.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What is the population's infection density that politicians will be able to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola gets worse in West Africa, I can see them ban all flights and boats towards the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods that say...
What a pity that the international media panic over Ebola is no longer being used to talk about less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting West Africans.
We're all under threat.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It’s such a sad news article, a big title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (all too relevant): Women are the first gift of care - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc.
Such smarter comments could have been made on how, why and where we can all contribute to better understanding and interpreting cultural and sociological approaches, and gender differences that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's go, think and write, we don't just make noise.
There's a time for everything.
If you are unable to provide a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, perhaps you should just think before you write?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same rank as decapitation - a form of terrorism as barbaric, its survival rate only making a different form of torture - to say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeding the meaning.
In fact - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give him a certain degree of "validity", but in this case it obviously does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was "growing" as a global resource of journalism - advancing in the 21st century, leaving behind its founding precepts.
Who, on the editorial team, lets it look like that?
For a territorial or other electorate, money does not count.
I read repeatedly that the territorial public service increases its staff, and I have never seen anything giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
This would be legitimate , indeed .
There will undoubtedly be lies and truths, to us to separate the good seed from the drink.
The Court of Auditors is expensive to tell so many economic nonsense.
It is true that they have never had anything to manage the people of Cambon Street.
TCs are not in deficit they have funding needs that only concern and only the investments they make.
It forced to use concepts too blurry the press as the World plays the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, debt mainly finances operating costs...
And as the over-employment of officials (for example, to make beautiful round-points) results in an increasing and incompressible burden (compulsory burden until their death, as living and retirement work), these communities are large in investments.
The staff member's status should therefore be removed, prior to the decline in staffing.
And also responsible mayors financially.
It is fabulous, intercommunals would have to be accompanied by a decrease in the number of communal staff and it is the opposite that occurs, proof that adding one step is not effective without removing others.
How do you want to manage large territories like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse where these territories were created is revolutionised, perhaps it would be time to react.
They wouldn't rather be imprisoned, worse encased, in the administrative canvas, would they look!
Let's even try it, it's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the state of Vème has led with its providential men.
This really started with Petin.
Then he went on to finish the series "end of breath" coming loudly about.
Why aren't they going to live in a 250 million-dollar apartment in Monaco over a movie to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, which will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the "whites" responses.
"Answers" not "Answers"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry up to be the first one.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to pass.
We now agree that the Modern Homo Sapiens has evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly wet period about 150 thousand years ago they have managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight miles) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence had stated a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
He was probably the only one in the government who seemed to be on the road.
Now, we know we can't trust him anymore.
I'm resigning!
2017:Transformation into a comfortable private hotel of golden wardrobes for future retirees from the Republic?
Moving from the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the Nantes and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money and the military are going to cure the flu of the little one elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of the patients are civilians, of all horizons?
The London Wasps?
I pity their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They left London last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the field of a rugby club instead of the reverse.
In addition, outside travel for the Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the trouble of being bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I was gonna say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they had access to other premises, did not do us any favors.
I love supporting Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has no problem with supporters and that up to recently was at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage resumed by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent issues of the CCFC, but this must be a good gimp.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest I don't know anyone who doesn't do it except a few Wasps fans at work.
Are they and a few thousand other people in the South-East likely going to follow them away or will they now have to support another team?
Nice pro-domo article and good extension.
But who cares?
But then, why are ALL computer systems not based on these concepts???
+because a giant mass of programs pre-existing (cobol, java), +because all systems do not require them, +because there is no ++ magic wand....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don't really matter, what counts is to be the first on the segment.
The work of G.
Berry is about a niche need.
Mr. Gérard Berry.
Such characters should be constantly (the media) working for the good of humanity.

But they don't sell.
Real-time computing has become a key sector in many areas, and few are familiar with the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been to an Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Do not ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
It looks like they're reasoning with make us more profits, and don't make us healthier dishes and the best value-price ratio.
They're taking us for pigeons.
Oh, yeah, be careful that people don't have too much grease.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt inside, it replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you must add to the water of pasta is negligible, but it greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way the pasta is cooked.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Each should try alternatives to company cooking.
Are there any family restaurants and are they offering tasty dishes at reasonable prices?
What happens in the United States is very sad.
A banal job accident that went wrong.
A promising young man, trained as a thief, was following his father’s career in prison for murder.
A man looked at everything and brutally interrupted this vocation of birth.
To be sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
Totally agree!
That's funny.
The desire to decouple it is obvious and hardly excusable and humiliating at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to cut it off is hardly excusable.
That's what makes me kind of like a 15-year-old kid.
During the trial the boy's father complained never to see his son again, but without apologizing to the relatives of the guy he himself killed.
Who's really a victim in this story?
What do you come to mix everything up!!!?
The boy's father was convicted of what he did.
With regard to the nonsense of the lost bullets, the accused and guilty, they knew precisely that the bullets were dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the defendant!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible for!
Ten years, that's a little bit to my mind.
For having the intelligence to shoot this young man to make noise?
That's what made it sound!
If the occasion occurs, go on vacation to the Mosulle valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small wine growers.
I've done it twice, wine, landscape and food are great.
In addition, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals that are held in each municipality, it is even better.
Sorry, Moselle Valley, I hit too fast.
It's nice to see that German wine is recognized.
It is important to note that German winegrowers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they must really work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some younger generations experience different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
There is not only the Moselle region that needs to be recommended - the Franconia, the Palatinet rhenan (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are German-style (or perhaps the reverse, short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot, and with a much higher alcohol content than their favorite 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines bottled to the property are so complex, the sweetness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad spatlese with a lobster thermal the next time you go to the restaurant.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine of Hugh Johnston is a great guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand that there will be new Guardian readers who discover the wine, but this is a summary of each newspaper article on German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article about German wines that are coming, the new dried from Baden that will now accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drank when they were young (hey, I don't really think that it is always true or evocative, unless I address myself to over 40 years - who, as I say, will have already seen all this).
Closing the Val de Grazi would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the regrettable state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-grand uncle who studied there.
In democracy, public health management should be submitted to the vote by the Chamber of Deputies: these department's cadres held by the barbichette, and those decisions taken in private, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin is right.
It should be done as in Soleil Vert: euthanasia at 70 years.
Moreover, we could resell the meat that will feed our poor (sic) assets because they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find work for our unemployed, real work, and you won't have any deficit problems!
For the elderly, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, missing, will not be able to hold this demographic transition alone...
So of geriatrics, of course, but to think otherwise of a hospital model of the 30 glorious.
Now, the maximum growth of 1.5% (this is already the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the entire model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that is best known in public hospitals.
If this tomb symbol is really fucked up.
First we fucked up because the rest of the hospitals aren't up to it.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites are taking care of themselves elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more likely to increase public service supply in other hospitals than to maintain two-speed medicine.
The Val is a pole of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
Closing would be a fault, a sign of more than walking towards France's mediocrity.
Not to mention the military status, which must be kept absolutely.
"The Hospital Day Award", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Department with local oversight of the Hospitalization Regional Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is only one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had at home.
In almost all countries of the world, a child born in this country to two non-citizens is almost always non-citizens.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious hard consequences.
Why??
It seems to me to do two weights.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all the persecution and abuse and war that drive people out of their country and force them to seek help in Australia.
If he does not want people to come by boat, then we have to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I don't have to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country returned to normal.
It all makes sense now, Nimrod!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe in this small supermarket when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and the abuse that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of Tamils linked to the LTTE, believing that they would be at risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its guidelines for the assessment of asylum applications in December 2012, and recommended that persons with LTTE links be considered at risk upon their return.
The year [2013] saw an increase in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr. Nowak, you've gone coconut with so much periodic.
In fact, this guy couldn't get even a chance to make it.
He didn't have a health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical spending during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes earth.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah !!!!!!!!!!!!
A little while ago, we were told that the Ebola kills so quickly that an epidemic of great magnitude was impossible (there is all scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of persons brought back was zero.
Stranger the more we reassure ourselves, the more I'm afraid.
You need to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Weak or even three weak but not zero.
Finally, c is a scientific reality, the more a virus is deadly quickly (in general) it is less likely to spread because the death of the host indicates its own death.
The combination of the 2 (high transmission and fast death) sometimes comes out of the so-called Spanish flu.
After this is the 40th general to save humanity..
Is there not something obscene about mediating certain brave and virtuous Westerners, but to the detriment of thousands of other African patients who are not known for their trade, bravery or virtues?
Of course, this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but repeated announcements are of terrifying bias.
Freedom of expression, so dear to conservatives.
The suspension was to keep doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms attacking the freedom of expression and the right to privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined their conservatives would have robbed them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that is exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heat tower for when the problem will actually become out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy of medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new medical research term fund, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be just a black budget cash register.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, it will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope that Australian voters will come to see this excellent russia for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is offset by the Medical Research Market Fund.
However, it is a loss to the sick, a loss to the elderly and a loss to the low-income.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, Telstra's "teacher" and its Telstra Term Market Fund were excellent tutors.
If it's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell for the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty....
I also noticed it, quite corrosive as a note.
If only it could dissuade her from keeping a buzz on it constantly..
The worst fate for a career policy: not to be recognized on the street.
Hello She has not been recognized in her city of Toul as being sufficiently high to administer it.
How good the "provincial" sense is!
We're living in a hate time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course I am against the port of the burqa, but that is not the question.
What this anecdotal says is sarkozism in the pure state: small, mediocre ministers, confusion between the government function and the performance function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on each step of the road to show that he is well-attended in public order), rudeness and carelessness to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all those "old personalities" who have become unwilling to carry a firearm and badge, so that they will have every leisure to exercise their self-proclaimed function of vigilantes.
But who is Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned Sarkozy's page, perhaps they do not regret it.
He really needs to stop before it becomes embarrassing for him.
I want this agent who was unaware of Nadine Morano's existence, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the sake
I don't agree, thanks to her we laugh well ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, she should be invented!
But it's easy, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
At this point, N.
Morano manifestly did indeed in contempt, in contempt of the police officer she had faced, and who would have had to multiply the curves and the "Yes Ma'am, of course, Madam, immediately tell me, Madam, in which direction I must run to seize myself without waiting for this veiled woman."
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets have abandoned an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians has become too important..."
The Americans are not bad at this, but I still think that Isis is going to go over them or have already done it, in Iraq at least someone had the bodies here now no one does.
As far as industrial civilian deaths are concerned, nothing rivals the war machine in the West.
I disagree, the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between the two Iraq wars, would have cost millions of Iraqis, especially children, elderly people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war protesters I knew preferred sanctions to defer the "war machine".
Were you also the type of guy who preferred sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good remark - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and inconsequentially in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and cannot reach the elite - probably a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents did not waste any time marking their main enemy when they saw him, in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the UN Mission GQ that they had just erected five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with force and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and harsh is this bombing, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission has been targeted like this.
Good note, I actually forgot that.
So add half a million people to the total number of deaths from Western nations (at least with recent disturbances in Ukraine the economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
It doesn't help your argument that exaggerating notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only vaguely reliable figures on sanctions-related deaths are those of children under 5 years of age and they are even very suspicious since Saddam Hussain refused to let objective inspectors see the facts.
It was obviously in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimates that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanctioned deaths in under five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanctioned deaths is largely partial to this age group.
Of course, it must be feared, but also the gift of games in general.
We must stop doing as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that children needed, and that we could do it with strangers that neither the parent nor the child may ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipus, 60% of the French make genealogy.
It is essential and despised to know its origins.
Instead of making it as if it were obvious and using fantasistic arguments, we should explain what serious problems may arise for a child adopted or conceived with a gift of games.
If you learn that the parents who raised you did not provide the gametes you came out of, you could return them, in my opinion, because they would have committed no crime.
The latest developments in WFP (e.g., auterus) are at least as questionable as a reasonably framed APG.
The real question seems to me to be: does the frustration of children's desire justify these acrobats and that has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Just like a point.
Obviously, we need to fear the GPA, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad that we can't have children when we want them.
It's a problem I've had with my wife.
However, it is less serious than to be born very disabled or become disabled, to contract a serious illness, to lose all her children in an accident, etc.
Among all the concerns of life is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
This does not prevent us from living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes well-consuming, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
A child's desire is not a whim where one could use the other according to his or her good will.
Sterility demands reflection and acceptance.
