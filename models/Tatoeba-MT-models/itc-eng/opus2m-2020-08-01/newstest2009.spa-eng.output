The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the early fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in ČEZ's shares reached approximately half the value they have in a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of March, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it descended about 6%.
The fall this time is due to the fall of the shares on Wall Street.
The market reaction to the outcome of the vote by the American Assembly of Representatives was also expressed here, which refused to support the financial sector secretary's stabilisation plan.
Loss of shares in Asia
The actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally mitigated some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index over its financial day marked almost four percent, although later it mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The index of Hang Seng China Enterprises that follows Chinese stock movements in Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by 3.8%, in Shanghai markets were closed.
The shares of the Sidney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan Stock Exchange according to Index Secretary dropped to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions programmed in the United States are unsafe and this affects the financial market around the world," said the Chief of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will make themselves felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which $700 billion (about 12 billion crowns) should be devoted.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, the American shares lived a bloody bath and mainly the index of the shares collected the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The index of Dow Jones dropped to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index came down before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress retreats: U.S. government can inject 700 billion dollars into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a comprehensive agreement to provide financial assistance to the American finance system.
Your vote will take place early next week.
The American legislators caused a gap in the discussions on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion kroner).
However, he is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and vote.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed in the Assembly of Representatives on Monday.
He told Reuters, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee for Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly on Sunday.
According to some sources, voting on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Thereafter, however, "disenchanting" will be achieved through the complex mechanisms which will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We resolve our conflicting views on the way in which the package of market stabilization measures should take", said Democrat Nancy Pelosiá to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the Government Fund.
It should buy from financial companies the unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to hard losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we're already on it," Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis expressly affects the rapidly declining stock market.
According to the Democratic Senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing their utmost to ensure that Congress finally approves an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses about the Asian finance market as these are the ones that are in the first time slot and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear as to when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote, and not even if they will not stagnate at the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the programme is not fulfilling its role, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was retained to earn financial resources for the purchase of bad mortgages whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and that he values "the commitment of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armoured contract
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, chief of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the program for the protection of taxpayers' taxes of their losses, a closing of the planned financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called armoured contracts for directors of the participating companies of the programme, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also has to help homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of payment on time of the debtors and allow them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological aid
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be crucial for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"A lot more important is that, already this week, the congressmen agree on their support and give you their good visa as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that such approval is now the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Armed fight: MP3 Player against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it's better to buy just the phone.
There are still sufficient reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on how you use it and on the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be hard for you to acquire the most modern record player to listen to in it the last album of Maxim Turbonc.
On the other hand, these kinds of musical products such as LP discs are no longer coming out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is no objective reason to continue to buy them.
If vinyl discs with art rock, jazz or blues accumulate in their shelves, you are probably dreaming about at least this type of record.
This is the same with the music on its way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music on MP3.
And here are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the commercial helmets from twenty to twenty crowns.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
Also decides the battery duration
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even that which not even most mobiles.
No current apparatus is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most basic functions such as calling, sending messages, you can play music and video, recording both, has a better or worse camera and you can even navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDA will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle because no fridge can make a grill and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
How many more functions you use on the mobile phone will first illuminate the screen indicator asking to be reloaded.
And music reproduction is one of the biggest energy tragons.
Few mobiles can play music more than 10 or 12 hours, most of which are much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, be aware that cheap mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If, in addition to this, they constantly call themselves, for more safety, a shipper for work - this is also valid for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, because even the worst are at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when you record music on your mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and not all of them can connect directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some reading units without reduction can connect the small memory cards that are used on mobiles.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through your computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players only create their order in the music library according to the name of the interpreter, album title, gender or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a tree structure directory similar to a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a particular equipment be interested in the strength of the accumulator, the capacity of memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its management.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as on the tram, then it is enough with any mobile playing.
What practically gets any cell phone real.
It should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile player plays the music.
The MP3 all reproduce it and almost all the music you get will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The fewer include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and your iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
Simply use the mobile internet to visit the operator’s relevant pages (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could in itself be a weight argument to acquire a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the subjects of fleeting success of the radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, this way of selling music (either via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) is supposed to dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find your mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, handlesfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every mobile, even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the greatest advantage for many music mobile phones will be your price.
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone entry.
The best ones, even with regard to the technical part, such as telephones equipped with a 3.5 mm entrance. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest ones (see our selection) - really handles any person.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the record player are evident.
It does not pose a threat that by mistake we connect to the Internet with the mobile phone and, consequently, gigantic data loss account.
For which apparatus to be decided
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
Basic models are normally equipped only with a maximum capacity card of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive have an 8 GB memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on capacity (maximum 2 GB) there is no need to spend more than 1,100 kroners.
If one of the most demanding lovers of music is considered to hand over the most specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line mobiles have almost the same use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand most arria brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will be arriving this year in the Czech Republic.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer almost all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It probably won't be long before we get there.
That the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed this by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU) who warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive in the Union.
Following the recent steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming fee regulation, it is likely to reach a paradoxical situation - for some clients of Czech mobile operators, SMS sending from abroad will be cheaper than if sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This is probably paradoxical to us, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition on the Czech market.
As a result, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú), Pavel Dvořák, has already stated that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant price drop to which classic operators should also react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can be successful.
On the other hand, there is no need to look too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to get over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
In addition, for them to function effectively, it is enough for many fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in building, operating and maintaining the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled at low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that however, it often contrasts with the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers at least half of the cheap SMS with respect to competition.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, it can also be a good blow for a trivial goal group.
This operator is specifically addressed to man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is hard to say whether it seems like a Polish concept could get stuck in our country.
This is why Vodafone's spokesman, Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of the supply of services is relatively saturated"
There are no possibilities in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there are any virtual operators in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in Czech R. doesn't seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," he said in telephone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly it ensured that current mobile telephony operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything possible to prevent any potential competition from occurring.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows it by the GTS Novera group that I would like to take a step forward to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile telephony operators.
With some of them we have been able to make progress at the meetings," said the group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe they're flashing better times.
It seems that, for informal information, the first official operator would have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this point we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
To date no one has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this field," he said for mobile.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesperson for Telefónica O2.
Other operators are concerned with the specificity of the Czech market.
The spokesperson for T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with the opinion of O2, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
And add: "On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short horizon"
Vodafone directs its attention rather to meeting the requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this with regard to the distribution of expenditure and infrastructure.
We precisely regard it as the biggest contribution from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is found in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile."
Responsible offices - with operators and meat
The progress of mobile operators can easily be understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a price drop and thus a decrease in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of that is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure to the ČTU was at the time of the entry of U:phone by T-Mobile society.
It is attested to by accessible public information on the ČTU websites.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrova adds this: "Also, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile telephony market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the market for mobile telephony in the Czech Republic, it is natural that another player's entry into the market would mean for him and, above all, for his services large requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Bids (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical stance on this issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
To date, no agreement has been closed since the offer of potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for classic operators," Kristian Chalupa, from the UOHS Department of Foreign Relations, added to our question.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers, it is something more than a consideration, apart from that, they must observe that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In abroad where virtual operators operate normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the price drop of mobile telephony services"
Obviously, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market media and the price drop does not fall within the interest of the UOHS.
It's really dramatic in this whole case is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no sign of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore, they do not have a corresponding rise in liability in their market actions.
The tools needed to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunication regulators," added Chalupa's response.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is obviously an analysis of relevant markets developed by ČTU that telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial bidding a single market.
On this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile telephony operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for UOHS should represent a warning that three mobile operators are strikingly lit in a similar way.
Current complaints from stakeholders (inflationed by GTS Novera society) show that in all negotiations with operators there are many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility in the ČTU is a quite common trick in the field of telecommunications from which UOHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We have already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately a new amendment was introduced recently to the Telecommunications Act for the expansion of the competition of ČTU in the field of commercial tenders that did not take effect, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be well known by the representatives of UOHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one looks
At the same time, unawarely, something still works as well as a pseudo-virtual operator that in the Czech mobile telephone networks there are a few already.
They are companies that place their own prices on mobile telephony services which, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies that are dedicated to multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only some chosen ones get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the company by commissioning a lot of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will receive after special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases such as those cited could be discovered, you could talk about infringements in terms of contract conditions that could be translated into the end of collaboration with the given society," replied the question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that a kind of activity carried out by mobile telephony operators would not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, they may become thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they get no negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a despicable as many percent of customers.
These must also accept that your phone's SIM card is not in your name so you cannot have it absolutely as a normal customer of operators."
Precisely this is what should seem to the ČTU at least strange.
There is also a new question for UOHS.
If mobile telephony operators are around their eyes in this type of procedure, why are they blocking the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it it should not be content with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that their trading conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market resulted in a significant decrease in service prices.
At the same time, almost all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, classic operators tried to protect themselves from this breach.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, eventually too saturated, problems with quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases have defended operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure they made the first virtual operator emerge and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body goes through this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
Through our experience we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of the powers in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this information between backstages is correct and the virtual operator actually arrives at these lands, then the Czech market of mobile telephony is likely to start moving again.
If any of the operators allows any virtual mobile telephony operator to enter, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, one with Coro and another instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are responsible for this.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said before it intentionally chose for the solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with the two and then, also, with the Choir that were fixed in the dictionary so that the text would be well understood, so that it would have consonance," he said.
The Czech official anthem celebrates next year's 175th anniversary.
The song Where, my Home played for the first time in 1834 in the tables of the Theatre of States in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
It won popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
The MHD in Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transportation Company the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be acquired right now by nearly 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day bonus and the annual bonus (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card in the infocentres and posts of the transport company at Metro stations, Museum, Mŏstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Bonuses can be purchased from yesterday online on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, up to the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start forgetting the ticket sales posts at the metro stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get out a regular ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged to you in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there are passengers at their disposal a window with prepared staff that helps stakeholders with the purchase on the Internet and also with the reloading of the bonus purchased on their card," said the project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard on the vending machines that are found in some subway halls.
How are these exduding machines?
They are red, they remind us of a billing machine and travelers will probably have already set themselves in them at the stations of the Roztyly Metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be loaded only on it.
E-bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the roundabout trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the localities of Central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus area," explained the ticket control, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that sets the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
The roundabout buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver's locker.
When entering it it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard at the location intended for it on the side of the box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel on the roundabout buses and do not remember when they are finished the validity of the bonus can be addressed to the expent machines where the cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information on the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudets in 1945 called for Fumaba to be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the South Bohemia Scientific Library collection.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, some groups of Germans from the South were allegedly addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It comes from the letters that are stored in a particular file and that are now stored in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American President that he would not allow the return of the "Terra Šumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry Šumava's destiny in their hearts."
In view of the fact that the Czechoslovak union with the southeastern Germans presumably assumes - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American President who assumes for today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that, without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all collaborates with the victory of allies," the letter states.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president allegedly doubted this idea of the Germans šumavos, it would suffice to organize a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or to live under their patronage.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of the post-war history, can sound a little childish, according to some experts finely paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of then.
Although the Czech Germans had to understand at least that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the Republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate for the Sudets some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
Even Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
This was in the war, like German of Budějovice, wrapped in the Baltic Navy.
When the British arrested him at the end of the war and placed him in Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought when they came home, the Czech would do them good," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected that on the basis of the Goods Decrees would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could be characterized by the emotional campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media on Wednesday.
The Minister's office, Aleš ?ebíček promises to deter drivers from driving dangerous behaviours.
The campaign of 150 million will be felt on television, radio, cinema, internet and brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from driving high speed and alcohol.
And also to remind them that before they start, the belts are tied.
He wants to reach awareness especially of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and ultimately also professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories embroiled in emotions.
And for this we are witnessed by the "blood" announcements throughout the campaign:
Don't think - pay!
The word "Don't think" is written with large letters on the license plate.
And in a shed of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man at a time of sneezing can come to pay with his own life.
Ads are going to "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out on Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be seen.
Promises that in this way it will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whey for drivers
"For drivers the sugar and whip system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and it saves time.
The whip is a threat to a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says hospital transportation psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
And that is why an information campaign is needed in the press and mainly a negative publicity, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of some danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay greater attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas for peace
The President of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke about the restitution of practically all the occupied lands in 1967, i.e., the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
I proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the journal Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we must necessarily return almost all lands (occupied) if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll stay with a little percent of these lands, but the Palestinians will have to give them a percent similar (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the case of restitution it would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as passed to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," pointed Olmert in reference to the two July attacks in the city where several dead and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, a sacred and historical place" within the old city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Highs of the Golan
Olmert also pronounced himself for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Highs, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to dissociate to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with the Hizbulah (the Shia Movement), they will have to get rid of the permanent support that causes the terrorism of Hamas (the Shia Movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Post-accident Questions: Are Snails Illegal on Buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long distance bus
In relation to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padua, we are asked whether the azafatas and passengers can move along the bus during the trip.
"If we wish to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of the azafata is opposed to the road traffic law," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that died last week the twenty-two-year-old saffron was evidently caused by the driver of the truck only because the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure location of the vehicle despite having booked two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the very moment when the soda distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays paper is whether the bus is equipped, according to technical permission, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long distance buses of Student Agency do not have places to stand, which confirmed the company director Radim Jančura to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was removed and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is on the way if they have a seat," he commented to us.
Azafata doesn't know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of azafata - no legal provision clarifys this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds, less briefly, spokesperson Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law is sufficiently sensitive to this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have on-board sites.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided among the urban areas, where there are places to stand and at maximum speed, interurban with sites to stand with higher speed permit and long distances without sites to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with safety belt.
As on the plane, says the expert
The expert from BESIP in Transport Security, Jaroslav Hořín, does not see any major problems with the movement of the azaphate on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to service on planes.
Not even here you have the assurance that the turbulence will come and that the towel can be hit on your head."
"However, if the bus suddenly brakes the physical laws are obviously valid.
The same as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The security of the azafata must be resolved by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law this problem is not solved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier offering the saffron service.
He employs two hundred in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, at the moment you have the impression that the saffron post is risky, then I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
I'd save even expenses," he says.
In the interests of security is the reason why Asiana lacks saffrons on her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which directs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have saffrons, we're against them from the beginning.
Before or after this this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A tragedy unfolded
In the accident of the line that joined Naples, a young Pilsen saffron who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably rotated from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to prevent it, however, shocked with the right front.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the azafata are sold.
"These sites are not possible to book for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck.
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the trial on compensation for the girl's family, but it is also waiting for the financial expenses for the culprit.
Law reform?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision to the movement of azafata on the bus in which thirty experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile during the march," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the saffrons to be an important threat to passenger safety", finishing spokesperson Hanzelka, that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
The hope of Dusseldorf is supported in Frankfurt
In the letter from the West LB Board of Directors for its employees, there is no shortage of words.
The merger of the Dusseldorf Bank's units with the DEKA bank can be formed 'a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group', as the written statement states, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the `competence block' with sustainable profit capacity, would enter this business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for further mergers in the area of regional banks.
That is how the text is understood, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the federal financial services monitoring institute which has recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also from Frankfurt, there is a lot of talk about the union of such a kind between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know about their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, showed that he saw no meaning in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the Board of Directors of DEKA, which is now composed of the regional banks and the Sparkassen associations, commissioned the joint directive to start negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
This could be about a business in the capital market or some parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, as is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the area of Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 the situation seemed to be so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
Only the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba board of directors, said he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of this it seems to be clearer that the union of different public law banks is necessary.
When the elections of the Bavarian parliament are to be passed, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge, Helaba will lack partners to do that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it emerged far better than the financial crisis that the buildings in Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided co-existence plans with the West LB.
In any case, there is only the North LB.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter from the board of directors of the bank, it is said that a complete solution would be sought for the whole bank.
As you can compare the coexistence between unique parts of the bank with DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, he attends Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-litre barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 participants from Oktoberfest that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, this evening at 23:45 three buses leave, towards Munich, the beer party, expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are mainly intended for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to its flag are singing the South Americans, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-colored pads, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have come to Okotfest, bearing in mind that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the turn.
spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to Bavarian purity law, sickness insurance and German guide- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on their way on the highway with the address "Brenner"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the quiet reigns on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
It is for Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration take another break on the 8th bus just before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has the expected arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Mark has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "knowingsiviaggianggia.it".
Second, "When the doors of the campaign store are opened, that means walking!", he calls Mark in the morning.
"Go!" Leave and occupy the back sites in the campaign store.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all with yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, distributed across all space!"
One litre of beer, please Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have good tone!
Just get out of your place, he'll be busy already!"
Third: "This afternoon at exactly ten and a half you have to get here!" Did you understand?
And now everyone goes to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, up the yellow hats on the trees, traffic signals and even on a poster of the elections of a great People's Party of Bavaria.
It is desirable to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and painfully enter the tents, 10 percent of them all came especially this weekend of Italy.
Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistics of the nations present, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite shop in the Italian campaign is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, only stressed last week the federal finance minister Peter Steinbrück.
Well, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's real estate fund, which is listed in the DAX index, receives a credit of one billion from the German banks in order to withstand turbulence in the market.
On Monday, a person who knew the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Hippo Real Estate is going to use has to cast interest.
Money comes from private banks as well as from public law banks.
The cause of this is the loss of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state finances with the money that was provided for long-term projects financed them only for a short period of time - which is now no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of the year the bank's cash capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of its own capital has delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued revenue from financial investments and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, the receivables for debtors and some securities also those from the dissolution of provisions of credit transactions tended to fall by more than 70 per cent, in 5 million euros.
Thanks only to the highs and many revenues of reimbursements for the restructuring compensation costs of the former Depfa group as well as interest reimbursement under the federal tax code and organized business for consortium companies, the negative balance could lead to a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatisation in 1990 the former state finance at first was lost in speculation with industrial loans for buildings, which served as a reason for the establishment of the Aareal bank.
As money could not be made with the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote intensively to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private investors and as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make depreciations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated group's profit and loss account, it is said very imprecisely.
It's a fact that dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007 they were cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became an important state and financial financial fund in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own the customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, what happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credits essentially dropped because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year, the Royal Estate Hypo requires nearly 50 billion euros to finance a portion of the Defa's credit portfolio of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report of the Hypo Real Estate, the bank covers with a credit the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international monetary markets which are now essentially not able to function"
Other sources say that thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the Royal Estate Board of Directors, explained that the Real Estate Group would not need money markets for foreseeable time.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Financial Services Monitoring Institute (BaFin) are based on the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured.
That's what shareholders and bank creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even possible that you do not need funding in your full volume.
But the case cannot be ruled out otherwise.
It was the voice that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary salvation can also reassure at least people concerned.
The price of action fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts are almost unchanged, loan courses according to the position in the property registration clearly tend to decline.
Those affected are mainly the loans from the former subsidiary Württemberg Hippo and rightly the loans whose dues exceed 2009.
After the notable growth in the banking crisis and acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculations should be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are not affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it can be based on early retirement.
Or something is going to happen, which can't be expected to imagine anyone - the financial crisis is going to be over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross news on partial statization, now the security already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleep, breaking their heads on the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put the end point and use the new account transportation of losses for next payment of benefits compensation payments on change in the future.
Sylviana and the secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at the Tachibana High School, the girls began to laugh: German is totally "Kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go by train 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
Alone had to find the way, luckily I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not set as rigorously as in my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I'd had to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not a person who talks with a lot of taste in the audience, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt of my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, this is how I put myself on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo She Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this point I was very happy because I had been studying this language for two years now.
All 31 girls in the class have brushed, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I quickly slipped into my site.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone spoke at once, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese.
Then at the recreation everyone drew his Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - is something else than boring pieces of German bread.
He had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu-mass meat.
In most cases I have no idea what it is like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marinated plums in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools sales are not just a luncheon.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bandage made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it in hopes of getting to know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read about in my Manga Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see him here too.
"Why exactly Japan?", my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always said:
"Well, because I am fascinated."
Finally for years I've preferred to read Mangas.
To better understand comics and culture, one day I began to study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I was going to travel there.
Also because I have a weakness for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other, it is a hard, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here although Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It's said that a rat or a cockroach feeling danger flees, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can it be controlled if they, acting like us, feel the same way?
The contributions of famous scientists have been published in an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years.
SPIEGEEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else could prove it until now, although we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains present the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and generally about consciousness, we enter the unknown area because hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as the other animals: he gets killed, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists draw conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contaminate our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and executive functions that lead behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Taking at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in the linguistic nature of man: As most of his experience is united with the tongue, often that means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even when consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as well as, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, does not let it be measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with major problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the consensual experience, but at the same time there is another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing is rather the neutral correlations of consciousness than the causal mechanisms: Both can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what results from that for the sensations?
I owe the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated which is responsible for that, the same thing as fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex that distinguishes primates and especially man.
From a linguistic point of view, fine sensation classifications are followed because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar so we can describe the states of others along with ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the body feelings and brain stem, as Jaak Pankseep thinks, but focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I don't think it's likely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can one control if rats and men behave in the same way feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, then because he's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the likeness of behaviour does not yet prove the likeness of experience.
That's true that the neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have brain stems like these, but the cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even when it is possible to prove it for men: How can it be tested for rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to distinguish fundamentally from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as it is measured by rats and men.
As I don't investigate the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward rather than work permanently with no results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister said that preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as the confidence test of Ukraine's ability to organize Europe's championship along with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is much to be done."
The hours of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries are taken.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work at great speed," said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA won't take our eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA Platini President that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season did many clubs in the first division be condemned because of manipulation down to the lower category, finally the division council had to be postponed.
Controat of Dennis Quaid Indignant
She wanted to promote a new film, she spoke in an interview about private life- and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan appointed her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses in the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan first spoke about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for revealing private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard how often Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old man told "New York Daily News."
Among other things it is very "sorry" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will publicly remember the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is newly married and recently is twins' papa.
And so he ends his statements by pointing out: "Whatever my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and overnight stays in hotels were again cheap - this is the result of a study by the provider of travel services and American Express financial services.
The company has analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter it found a major change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe rose by average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices had already fallen to 3.6% by comparing last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause that "the interests of American tourists in travelling decreased."
The decrease in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannóver, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices increased to 26.3 percent and thus beat a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, the prices of airline tickets also showed upward trends:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, travelers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June the prices of the plane tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, averaged 12.5 percent, but the changes in the prices for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany price change was more remarkable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they decreased to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for national flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of price change is on the one hand the increase in the weak economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the airline travel market demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes the traffic of aircraft between the United States and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that declared bankrupt in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him is not yet going out to make the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of the player of the national selection Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed making a goal.
All I meant was exactly reacting to what happened, he could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew you were right.
"We need a second goal," silbaba Hermann Rieger at the cabin entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happens in the catacombs, the rest time is over and most of those present were back on their sites.
Rieger was for almost three decades physical therapist of the HSV, he enjoyed a great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded with his head and raised his fingers in a sign of assent.
Cornelius is brother to Martin Jol, Hamburg's main coach.
His order was the same: Well, the second goal!
But that was not done.
"Today wasn't all nice to see," added Marcell Jansen.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petri (11) with its head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg is going to be 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It provides that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the speed of the alloy than to the dominance of its HSV.
The quipo with its obligado players late like Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Petric greedler as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but the quipo still cannot shine with their successes.
"We need more than the feeling and the dribbling," Jol says.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank's rescue package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in his history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
About 20:30 one of the most important barometers in the world scored a 5 percent deficit in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained in 1548 points.
At this moment the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs' shares lost almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, a large Warren Buffet investor had been financially involved in the company.
The rescue plan plans to make available resources to purchase so-called "podride" mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid by blow but step by step.
As compensation for this, the State has to receive the share option receipts for financial associations that can be charged during the course development to reduce the financial burden of the state box.
Action courses in Europe and the US continue to decline
One billion aid to banks in Europe and the United States does not reassure investors.
The course of the actions of the large German bank Hippo Real Estate is low and influences the Dax negatively.
Despite the saving of the financial market projected by the state, the US Dow Jones index is still falling.
Loss of the speculated shares of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the federal government and private banks, the action of the Munich real estate fund a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and quoted a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
Financial markets worldwide have suffered a fall.
The opening of the Wall Street Day in New York began with remarkable losses.

Dark Matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused the inconsistencies of researchers: the Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The "Ulysses" space probe spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are leaking now threatens him to die in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to maneuver, has caused confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver in the trajectory of space probes while they get an acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example from Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses Sun probe did.
But what surprises researchers for many years: missiles do not behave by 100 percent as expected according to the venerable gravitation law.
Instead, they frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
Physicians could not explain this effect until now.
He was called anomaly during gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's Theory General Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, American physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what were left of astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be the Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known the existence of the Dark Matter for only ten years.
She supposedly has the attraction force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientific calculations, the Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by the Foreign Minister of Italy, after ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of the ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during liberation.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations have already begun.
The Germans always fall back to the point of attention of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper reports on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are seen as being released.
That is why the same information presents Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of the release at the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian minister for foreign affairs, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'Now we control your health," said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, reports Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was just "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
On Sunday, the Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them detained in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded the rescue from Germany amounting to six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife to one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, kidnappers intend to release women hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to stay in detention until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Stepmother abuse "leaded to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by their stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Truro Royal Court, through an investigative study, knew that he regularly had attached his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court found out that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
During the time the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and sell her eyes before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working on a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Ms. Randle, who had spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Mrs. Rande's friends had said about her, that after she had been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "renounced life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by choking through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying, "I used to tie her up and sell her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking away his own life.
Even more clearly, it is that if she had not done so, the question would probably not have ended in the courts."
And he added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on his daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defence, abandoned two highly classified documents on the Waterloo train.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention of delinquency.
The BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the staff member must be accused by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then moved from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than £80,000 after the rescue/savance of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million bank savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the savings money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humbling" that societies and their members have to pay for
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be reimbursed after Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest payable on an interim basis is assumed to be charged to the 700 financial companies with deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called upon to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This means that societies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Trade Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent."
According to BSA, no data indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options are available to protect construction societies and their members in front of what might be a relevant price," added Mr. Cole.
Interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to March.
In 2010, this will be a full year of due interest, which may be almost twice as many.
As mutually-construction societies organizations and as there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk rises five pence per litre
The people on the Jersey Strip will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence the liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and after the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had increased before February, it was in 2002.
The former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the application for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various allegations of corruption in your charge.
His long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail early this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the militaryly supported government grant her full freedom first.
The correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is now unclear what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail petition for Sheikh Hasina claiming that she could not obtain bail because she was already being treated abroad on parole," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"Let's file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
His defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after 17 October, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, supported by the army, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-polymyelitis vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesperson said that it occurred despite the promises made by the Taliban that would not have attacked or obstructed thousands of staff while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge in ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision requiring the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its participation by 17.9 per cent in ITV below 7.5 per cent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests impede competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, in buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopolie Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV participation raised doubts about the independence of ITV, and encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including the head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom, opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, BSkyB said, would have delivered its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. lawyers
The US Attorney General has appointed a Special Procurator to investigate the dismissal of nine US lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of management officials.
The report criticized the White House officials, legislators and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Several allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine US lawyers were removed from their offices by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was assumed that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the pursuit of Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the layoffs, gave up his position.
A number of other staff members of the Department of Justice did likewise.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of the role played by Mr Gonzales in the matter, and stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for layoffs, which "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf with a lot of honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special prize next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that getting this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album that Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group is taking the candidatures for this year's awards and grading the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that exceed time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell from Meat Loaf remained for about nine years in the classifications and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it appeared that he had a cyst in his vocal string.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps ready to sell
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of the First Street – before I found the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, looks like a dusty alley more than an active road.
No signs.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on the First Street
that wants to re-establish Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-time neighbors who commented they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the past of the block before the appropriation of buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Wage Community Committee for Land Use this month, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring that the street remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, the Community district manager n.3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street arose for the first time during this month's meeting
but Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Committee on Preservation, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is the development of property rather than the management of that property.
Compared to its more colourful surroundings, Bowery, Extra Place has left a trace in history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps better known for the photograph of the establishment that emerges in the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, Ramone's manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about East Village’s suburbs, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest ones, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically unchanged, a king of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk in the history of the city about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow and no exit, dark also for the day and marked by doors of oxidized iron warehouse and counter-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blowing along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was healed through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now welcomes a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but they suggested that it could be cleaned.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Spanish voters is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are the example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English in class, is effective in eradicating distance in final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
More than a third of the students, many of whom have just arrived, are learning English.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent has dominated the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama favoured.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competences and does not tolerate any excuse attitude.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of the Sixth Street, the school's approach to teaching students English is in the "total immersion".
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who arrived from Mexico and who, if you go into class 12 months later, would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating by other schools with large Spanish-English pupils populations?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the response, but the idea of the politicians of your party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their continuing support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
While it is true that immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English
And instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after the renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Raw oil shares decreased by 7 percent to $99.80 in the morning negotiations in New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, the prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before returning, once again, because of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety seized investors, once again on Monday, despite the Congress leaders who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was haunted by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, as the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, on the frenetic weekend, negotiations leading to the rescue agreement "they seem unable to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, a reduction in demand for commodities, including oil, is expected.
"The prospects for global equity, the interest and exchange rate will become increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contamination.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, such as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast to reduce the price of oil and gas is 20 percent by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After having spent the last eight seasons, more than anyone else in Jets' uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw things develop on the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without an annotation into a deflate game.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second fourth began after the Jets and the Cardinal Arizona had played with skill under the shadows of the clouds.
At this moment it happened that the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranues Coles achieving a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect premonition for one afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of them when a cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He is a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, the Cardinals' defense mistreated the Kurt Warner quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a running shot and returned 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last shift, the shortcomings forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a definitive 34-0.
They're the bigger points that Jets never did in a room.
The team coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, said, "The second or third room?"
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second room much more than the third one.
They've earned a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebslelassie Rest Head Your World Record
Once again, Haile Gebslelassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated why many consider him the greatest runner in history, overcoming his own world record at the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the comfortable field race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie destroyed for 27 seconds its previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established world record number 26 in an impressive length race so it has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the counter-reloyal race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebslelassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution aggravates its problems with asthma.
Instead, he ran to Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using on average a few cutters 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebslelassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told journalists that he had suffered cramps two weeks before and had lost a week's training.
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebslelassie told the journalists.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end it was all right."
The athlete has been subject to some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the African-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, based on the pacemaker as if it were a race track, and putting the record before the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of the skills of Gebslelassie as runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebslelassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebslelassie after their pacemaker declined.
But just before three miles from the goal, Gebslelassie took a last boost to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived in third place at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan but now German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She neither took part in the Beijing Games so it was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set up her best record staff in almost five minutes on the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculus race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of colour life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometres from the bright, noisy and colossal city, lies a quiet village, where pride and complications of the African-American experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated into the country and place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs.Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a touristic stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and does not know what is going on."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the race issue, many remain cautious in front of the outside world.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a lifelong resident and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been a paradox of triumph and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of the assertion of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black South - sometimes despised, other praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as no one here calls it Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown into the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida’s guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten into the history of blacks and human drama.
Having cement face both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road on the left hand," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, care for Howard Miller, as he can just read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the Dash widow and writes that Glenn Lee "sells all kinds of drinks and anything goes with transitional rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts in relation to Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as she was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to dress with dignity today.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," follows Mr. Franklin.
But she added, swinging on her chair in a back yard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although he was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think your contribution to the world or your inheritance was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "wrapped in Rainbows", a biography by Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
The Orange County officials wanted to set up a five-way road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way street of the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended it relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mixture led to hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys were going around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next door," said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl, too, once.
He was thrown into a car's water tank."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston wrote in the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, at Brown v. Board of Education "was insulting rather than honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the breakdown of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the trust of their young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't going to hug your teacher because I was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with boyantic, trust and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, a acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookshops, reintroducing her into the American canons.
The road project came right at the time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was under the spotlight again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county might ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The idea resurrected from the road to five tracks would have been to put on what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People from outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National History Registry in 1998.
A new library (with the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, about a re-revived and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like in a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as that founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit in advance is necessary to do most interviews, and some things - such as the murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, there has also been a higher level of native pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of 18-year-old nephew Edwin Harvey, who planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosks and the gigantic TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the bee nest offices above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face daily with the worst "bad day of the office" since the fall of 1929.
Girls for home delivery continue to resonate their metal carts for tea through the sidewalks and carry trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between buildings of loaded apartments, like human mules, with 50 eccentric prints hanging on a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their food to carry in the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees still wait while queued for their bagel to the shopping carts of the sellers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. on the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time required for the operation to coincide with the calm of the end of the afternoon in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw your cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers throughout their lifetime order their check-callers, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's large stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my personal banker of trust, and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from where they had been switched, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money out of the so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), credit unions and savings boxes from their native city whose branches only work within the state of belonging, and which they say treat customers as their family.
During last year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, broke into bankruptcy, and as New Yorkers headed to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers at the offices and shops that stayed in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank that is considered a safe haven, which is making most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her distressed executive director, Dick Full, commented on the matter as if they were complaining about the inactivity of a colleague.
And Lyn, fifty and something in uniform of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our talks about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the shop.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is made, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim graves desecrated at the time Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left side of the far right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated to the far right party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Citys against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry traffic signals that represent mosques with a red line that crosses.
The police are blaming extreme right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend as the political parties on the far right made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as David's Star over some of the graves, but researchers think this may have happened by trying to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was somehow related to the elections.
A spokesperson from the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of desecration, which came to Muslim religious as Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme-right parties that captured almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of its slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headkerchiefs and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent ' s police issued a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter ' s previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Judgeship of Ashford Magistrates in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Judiciary said: "On Thursday, 25 September in the Judge of Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad like France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as a result of being under the registration of sexual offenders.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent's police said they wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible whereabouts of Glitter in the county.
A police spokesperson from Kent said, "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A police spokesperson from Kent said, "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who stays in the UK because here we have systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's inhabitants is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of the sex offenders registered in the county and minimize any possible risk to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrate Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for the possession of images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, calmed down and rejoiced to learn that they had banned Glitter from travelling to France and Spain.
"Capto a maestro out of scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No tacons, no flyers, no star suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
Out of the way, the artist.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, at such moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, concerned because they are not going to go to the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the Flemish Photography Month programming, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifys that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the big flamenco."
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Mines", Bauer began in 1,997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plaque camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classic base of the image, confirming modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of dance, song or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with what is essential, with the sedentary who becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the El Fotómata gallery.
Known figures of flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of nearly seventy photographed artists.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits displayed in the sample.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portrait Portraits of Veteran Sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, know them and be able to enter their lives for a moment, be it a long or short moment.
I think inside the photograph the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you don't know, or that leave you just a few minutes to be able to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco which is entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located on the 20th Street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a fear"
He is situated in places he still does not know and deals with unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to moving forward the new project in which he works, a novel that has as protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and went through Amazonia.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in its passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies "is a fear" and that "everything indicates that I should not write" the novel.
"If it was sensible, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it once," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that he's seen going through the city of the Aqueduct for four days to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the word festival and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", filled the opening of the theatre Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a public delivered to whom he was made very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how he was born in him his literary vocation, derived from the "extrodinaria adventure" of the "place to read" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined manner" to fill his "inspired lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and remaking much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish American novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has effects" and "makes people more unfit", so he asked the writers "do not give up on frivolity" and "take responsibility" his vocation.
Climatology melts the Pozoblanco fair that also remains without areas
The celebration of areas closing the subscription to the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the announced areas that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather conditions have been on with this fair, since at last two of its three celebrations have not been possible.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
The cartel was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a prison in Castilblanco.
So, only Friday was celebrated.
In it, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetic.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante went out with greetings and an ear, giving more the tendons than his tore.
That is, worse still was El Juli, who passed through the body of Llanos without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief spell was won the brow of a large part of the public.
A control in Álava in a pickup truck with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Ertzaintza traffic control in the municipality of Armignón (Alava).
The agents lift the two occupants of a van and they undertake the flight.
Its load, more than two tons of hashish, was not like stopping.
The officers persecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., as reported in a statement by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been accused of drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control at N-1, at their passage through the municipal term Armignón.
They were willing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, sped up sharply, and the control jumped.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later in the archen, when their two occupants stepped on to flee the race through a forested area.
The Ertzains finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, a Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish burdens, so they transferred it to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so the arrester had also been charged with an offence of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as it had been said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A. A. J., was transferred to police units to conduct the relevant proceedings and will be available to the court within the next few hours.
Stop actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of some medicine
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to leave her parking in Montecito, as she revealed to the magazine People a spokesperson from the California road patrol.
The witness has detailed that over 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to pull out the car from the parking lot forward and backward, and going back passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently had not initially recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was shown to be cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to the officials at first sight, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medicine."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison around 7 p.m. even though he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Calls urge the Andalusian UI federation to assume its competence in the Silva case
The co-ordinator general of IU and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of training which will have to make a decision on the case of the former Councillor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of dealing in favour of relatives.
"I am a very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," he said. "Calls on the action the party must take with which so far the council in the Sevilla consistory.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "IU has always defended that such matters have the highest degree of transparency."
In the same vein, he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public positions".
May Blood, Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish uprising against the French in Sangre de May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "enlighten the stream of characters and social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide list of interpreters.
Blood of May, with a film above two and a half hours, premiered this Friday in the cinemas, to become a miniserie for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this film "a dream of childhood", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid charged him three years ago to roll a commemorative tape for the second centenary of the 2nd May Madrid, something that he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets which the Community of Madrid has provided in its entirety constitute a "unique opportunity" for Garci to set up with the decorados and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "an atolondrada Spain which has been wrong as the head for fighting, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had such funding as that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of Sangre de May - so he has not been able to film some scenes painted in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the director of Return to Start, has influenced in which is his usual form of work, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually tries before starting the shooting and those who do not casting, to appear to him "humbling" and to consider that "part of the director's profession is to go to the theatre and to the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters who coincided with those in Sangre de May repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate for Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the Blood of May itself, Seven tables of French billiards and the finally selected one, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is to be made known", he said.
With this film Garci does not expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you're conforming to making a more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional trajectory.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillana dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillana dancer will also pay tribute to a Sevillana dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dynamic and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
His dance titles have suggested flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in his shows, as he did in that of "La door open"; and with Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola older, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have agreed to act in my work and I feel very honored for it."
The assembly also includes the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who makes the role of the eternal companion of these artists who were divas throughout their extension, and who are always in love with them."
The work also includes in some way the life of this woman who developed in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all Europe, since she was habitually living in London.
"I wanted to remind you because I think it's from those women who have a huge influence at a given time and now nobody knows and much less puts into value their work," says Bayón.
The show will start today at 20.30 at the Lope Theatre in Vega.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poet Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Council of Culture of the Board of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" came to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that was held in New York City, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That light chop", which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the various Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
Also, the Culture Council of the Board of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Newly Founded Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de Malicia", and gives the idea of the disappearance of American cinema, and from all America, in the striking idea that Newman has gone.
Look how hard it was for them to give him an Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that he knew he was very sick.
It's still been a trap for everyone.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid to do the ridicule or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When so hard is time and without virtue men and very few beings to admire remain you, it doesn't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, it embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and real.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and cattle causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn dying from overdose to his brand of home and organic food.
All a gift to a country that has been very hard to overcome is a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood muddled admiration without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that he had not died a man but an age.
Another Englishman, director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was no less than the summit of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us all very high list," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping up the demand for probity and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but later married Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was faithful when he was probably left with opportunities not to be.
"But why am I going to eat burger outside the house if I have steak?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that his daughters on earth match their fans, something unusual in America.
"Of all the great roles that he played, none was as proud as that of devoted husband, loving father, solicited grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics are celebrated in Madrid and, after the failure of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's career, I say no!
The perfect race was called, and I think it was the worst race I've ever been in.
It would certainly be a very clear suspension if they took it into account as an assessment and I examined it.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
The disincentives start with the collection of the backbone, which makes you have to go first.
Which doesn't sound bad to me, but if they already make you go get it all (including chip to avoid queues in the race).
Not at all.
Here they only made you go to pick up the backend (first depurpose, go only for that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second depurpose, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided because of the crisis to buy only small t-shirts with less fabric and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a little bit like those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes of waiting lasted, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the waiting of more than 40 minutes, which joined popular rebellion cones and assaulted the cassette.
I think about 500 people are probably going to have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark my way out correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect career, this would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search for receptionist (virtual)
At MIT Microsoft's Emerging Technologies conference, it has shown a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move through the company campus) according to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they wear - and hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and tells him he'll be looking after him soon.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we have talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers were to come with the essential instead of carrying commercial garbage, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
A whole finding bearing in mind that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extra" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, as well as the software.
When Google Chrome got into the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly noted that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is the essential layer for Hardware and Software to understand.
It performs the same role as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear but we must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What's half the applications coming into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its services online and that they are finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a little example.
The photo of this post I took it in one of Microsoft employee rest rooms in Redmond, early in the month.
In the refreshment machine a cartel asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive in early 2009 but in the end, rather by shooting at 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is every day more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio read one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', the same as Al Pacino in 'El Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the gay muscular parish.
And if we get to list stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that sharp mustache force that raised weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical male underwear shirt in cotton, stitched and without sleeves.
The 'tank', which they call the English speakers, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles points out over all the others.
First of all, by his bloating name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - that has to do with sport because he receives his name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out over others for their excellent cotton, for their unisex cut, for their distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most iconic shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And pay attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its top tanks.
Also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babes, mini shorts...
Dresses designed for comfort underwear.
Although it's a shame to leave them like underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me."
His huge resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion that the company Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, win in the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new Mango collection based on in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the 50's and 60's cinema; so we draw a lot of references.
Then, I really like to lose myself in a city and watch women dress up, like they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything unites and has many ties in common.
I liked my clothes when I was a kid; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to steal my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to look after my clothes.
You know that dancers like to do our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look at our mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the costume is when you actually find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with great respect to designers and professionalism.
You've been there for a while, 30, you've been in a crisis?
What's up.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think of being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks for it and I want to be a young mom; this I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're waiting for several stars that you rolled last year.
That's it, and I'm looking forward to you seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, everything I want for now and of course, can't be.
I want 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the tomb of Christ' to be released.
See how they look like them...
A few days ago you started a walk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went up a walkway to make a model.
Simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to take part in a beneficial parade for his organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we displayed - I pulled out two pieces of our collection for Mango - was auctioned to raise money for this NGO from Naomi.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm keeping that good part she's involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to do the pine, as well.
To benefit the women of the third world, whatever is needed.
Drivers who have relapsed by alcoholemia must install alcohol
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, to install in your vehicle a system that prevents the removal of the drunk vehicle, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the State Attorney-General ' s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so the driver will also receive a road reeducation course.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fundación Instituto Tecnologique para la Seguridad del Auto (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once by driving drunks back on the car.
Alcohol will avoid it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in breathed air and prevents the car from booting if the driver does not blow abate; or when an alcohol concentration is detected it is higher than the permitted one.
Its cost is higher than 1,000 euros and would run on behalf of the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people a year.
The measure refers to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing such behaviour before they result in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done on an ordinary basis, and yet the necessary criminal reform requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been pilotly implemented in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow morning, the Congress of Deputies will vote for a PSOE initiative in which it intends to install this system on school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., the scheduled time for the programme landed at the Hangar presidential of the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling.
The sun was retreating, but its rays still forced the hand to use visor mode to see the real couple get off the plane.
On foot to the stairs, the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street, if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official journey.
- Oh, very good, so you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marine soldiers who interpret the rescue of honours.
The Prince appeared smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, melancholy in the wind, very sober, did not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps had told her that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a listening ear to the photographers before they move into the room where the official board awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four major cities, awaits them a newspaper about Mexican television.
The best-equipped award of fashion
There is likely to be no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there is no live designer more exquisite and good alive than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new talents of fashion.
It is awarded a prize of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs at the Mango window in number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest shop in Europe and it has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one's in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, made us finish at a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the gala presidential table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with his heart broken with grief and making tripas heart, for his brother's recent death, put on a coat of the House and a few ELAH fixtures, which cut the breath, and from his son Luis' arm - a canyon of almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner homage.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the baron of Rothil, without jacket, because they had both lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the shop with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner turned into a long black sexy dress, was thrilled when on the night stroll through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they taught us the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a hideout of 'great fold'.
Inés Sastre didn't spend the walk around the palace dependencies, but he taught us on his son's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that moves by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously requested that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And in case it's little, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookshops on September 30.
The awakening almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 in the morning, but it is even worse to imagine itself involved in the agitated rhythm that imposes today's life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection with the working world.
No, the number rises to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book a whole menu of possibilities adapted to everyone's taste and minutes.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookshops of the Pearson Alhambra and DK editorial.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in such areas as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such belief.
It also offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Talk Sleepy
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very often telling us something that's happened the day before, but children who talk when they're asleep.
The first time it happens to the best you're scared, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign alteration of the dream that is called sleepwalkers.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them told him he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadicly (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once every week, once every month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They often relate to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (to get sleepy feet) or sleepy sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be that way.
As we have mentioned earlier, they may also be associated with very high fever rates, stress situations or overexcitement.
However, it is an unstudy phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
You may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a whisper or otherwise (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to see if there is any issue that is generating much anxiety and gives him that way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another disturbance of the dream that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are afraid or a little violent.
With very nervous children and which it costs them a lot to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will help the child to have a calmer dream.
Once the sleepwalks appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day you will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should consult or find out what it is that causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the usual), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him to whisper to him.
You won't get anything, because when you're asleep you're not aware how to organize your thinking.
You will also hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern finally!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in his field after a long period of shortage.
Without a good game, the team created many goals and was able to make a goal to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this encounter at which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who was squeezing the squad with a shot away, Illhaeursern was almost going to take the "power" and in turn Foundflick away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of his foot or also Diebold were coming to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
On the front, we would not let the center camper pass and leave only Riahi in position to attack.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousians with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the gourmet Illhousiens will not be able to taste their happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and leave their teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven illousians who retreated a bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after an important butterfly, the balloon passed very close to the cross-country.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a ride to Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who severely disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hope that " come with concrete proposals ".
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " set up by Breton fishermen to achieve measures to address the increase in oil prices, which marks a record when reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elyséeo David Martinon, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses to be competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of mariners " .
Fishermen await Nicolas Sarkozy on a firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to soften the circulation in Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused nearly 10 km jams.
The sports port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle Island have not been stopped.
"A filter barrier" has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors had already shown their determination on Monday by burning, by scratching the dawn, tyres and wooden pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the Brest ports, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and of the Mancha, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the oxen stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until this Wednesday meeting which will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on gas oil, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre but believe that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a gas oil at a price of less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two Men and a Destiny " has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also welcomed the legend of the film and the committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautical company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threat of recession that weighs on the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft builder, Embraer, maintains his forecasts of deliveries for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, reaffirmed Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer trusts much in the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would want to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group, which has been pulled out of trouble by the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 per cent of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion loan, according to the edition of the Financial Times Sunday.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper specifies.
The board of directors of AIG met last Sunday afternoon to examine potential sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 per cent share in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times is being pursued.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its 85 billion loan that the Federal Reserve granted it at risk of seeing the American authorities take 80 % of its capital, diluting it with the appropriate proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic Paris Stock Exchange meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss never seen in the 800-point stock exchange, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded last September 17, 2001, that is the day the exchanges resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, which is technologically dominant, went back 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the standard & poor's 500 extended index 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the definitive closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to recover some stability on the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives denied the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he asked for.
About two Republicans out of three rejected their plan.
"That is not a good sign sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of the FTN Financial.
"This shows how far the market had this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come "too late".
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the U.S. Central Bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, Chief of Economy and Finance of Global Insight.
And emphasizing further the sense of urgency, " every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Mrs. Piegza stressed.
After the collapse of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the banking activities of Wachovia by their rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis dramatically accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets face "not only a crisis in the United States but a global crisis," added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market went up dramatically.
The return on the treasure bond at 10 years was 3,632 % against 3,827 % on Friday afternoon, and the 30 year old bonus was 4,161 % against 4,357 % on the eve.
Obama, winner during the first TV duel
The first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House took place to find out who won between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Without surprise, the general barracks of Republican and Democratic campaign proclaimed their own victory in this television duel which has been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though honourable, was not "sufficient enough" to allow him to slow down in the five-week polls of the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published on Saturday last gives Obama five points of advantage (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that it is the democrat who came out well.
Among the indecisive voters, who count, Obama won 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them awarded McCain victory, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his candidate member José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts," said Bill Clinton, however this weekend.
Septagenary McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing his opponent's "ingenuity" on these issues that were at the heart of this first challenge.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... "accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge needed to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disconcerting himself, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television advertising that rebuked the Republican for not having considered the impact of the crisis on Americans.
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama reported yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a cold rain.
He did not pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favours Obama, who is regarded by Americans as the most capable person to save the economy at the edge of the precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive episode," he estimated, yesterday, the influential and democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's " good economic instincts " with Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final result of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that it would, in spite of everything, reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans in spite of Wall Street's overruns, the Illinois Senator also pointed out that the realization of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
Prudents, both candidates avoided issues relating to the $700 billion financial rescue plan (EUR 470 billion) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents manifested last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday afternoons since the closure of the electoral centres in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, he has to resign " .
Some acknowledge that they have not voted: "Why, because they will do what they want with my vote," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that made foreign observers good in order to renew contact with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered to be clean for observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
" We have been placed alongside the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes," Iour Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, regretted a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former candidate of the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, is the executive power.
If some Members of the opposition go into parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
" But its entry into parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in regions and bills."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, gets into crisis, and if we don't reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition feared that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that had followed the electoral process did not recognize the validity of the vote.
It stresses that participation figures appear too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26 % of voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections? Ask the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to parliament, who are better suited to power."
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the central electoral commission congratulate on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday his 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Hema-Québec has returned to be one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public that he had seriously been hesitant about the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster could no longer be reproduced.
While Judge Krever was late in presenting his relationship, certain provinces then established a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public ", says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary nevertheless recalls that " confidence is extremely fragile " .
Since its inception, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended the birth in Europe of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious disease can emerge from it, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown out of all doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive technique of HIV detection appeared on the market: the nucleid acid tests that allow the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus to be detected directly in the blood of donors, which have been based on the tests used so far.
Tests of nucleid acid allowed the period between the moment the person has been infected and the moment the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We could reduce this period in less than a week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed the risk of contracting AIDS significantly for blood transfusions.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
So since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products every year, more than 24 years will pass before a case of transmission of HIV to a blood product occurs.
I believe that one can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without concern," says the head of Héma-Québec's management.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
You must be constantly vigilant ", pursue Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Québec must also provide for sufficient supplies.
" Needs increase because the population ages.
Since the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need red blood cells or platelet injection.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the network of blood donors that regroups on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All people with good health, aged 18, who meet the eligibility criteria, however, can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory covering the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and urge them to be regular donors.
Since today's life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood," says Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye balloons and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered as biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of severe diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, placing in the bank of our thousandth sample of blood from the umbilical cord and it is expected to take more than a thousand of these a year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year," said Dr. Décary who describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this " , since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact on the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semi-finals of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a win for 3-1 (4-3 in fine sum) on the coast of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the final quarter series, in the Sapute Stadium.
The centercampista Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without goal anywhere, the centercampist David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many occasions of goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who ruined Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first round of the games round and round, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The Impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take it by 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact should face Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The number one trio of the Canadian is willing to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn stimulated the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win against free shootings in front of the Panthers of Florida last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the Tricolor room in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I prevent the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the most in the first time, noted Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Juan-Talon yesterday, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to be elected during today's partial election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying on the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three huge screens, they displayed spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec, seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means, like during the electoral period.
The Prime Minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a "view" that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a " new economic space " which includes an agreement on labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was " a jewel to the immense potential " but did not give a term, investment amounts, or a precise priority in future projects.
What could be more developed in particular is hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, which is dominated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " as listed by Mr. Charest.
This "territory twice as large as France," is our home, is in Quebec.
Not only is it at our home, but it is in us," he insisted, as to show that he was requesting a national founder myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, stressed: the laugh towards gold in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having taken a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, specified the prime minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion is presented, I repeat that position on the part of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North " , said speaking of the passage of the northwest, which will be opened each year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the Quebec Ungava party), have already started consultations around 30 communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role started some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given " .
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly " , he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is continuing with that of the first Liberal ministers who preceded him.
" Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently about transforming the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
" De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Borassa that made the James Bay our party knew how to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, she invoked another reference, this conservative, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its implementation is planned for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I expect to be there," he entrusted his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stressed that his schedule was still full, particularly because of a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec particularly demands recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto over the decisions made in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the main lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had, "we would have made progress today," said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that was done today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec's Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan on the part of the Government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, who returns on holiday today.
Letters - A dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in Harper's office, who last summer was allowed to say that Luisa Arbour was a "disgrace" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who has waged an unceasing fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national that is closed in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not in any way take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are brought against him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and leaves a child soldier living in inhumane conditions.
The only one who clashs with false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
We recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, particularly, support Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn't matter whether a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We still do not realize that, but at this moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when no more morals exist: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far minority (what will happen after October 14th?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government gave up what our country's reputation and dignity was doing.
Mr. Toews shame is caused by this resignation and nothing more.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
On September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J . Garver, Vice-President and Director of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold states that the largest gold company in the world attempted a process of defamation of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution by defamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to have a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the complaint is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada must spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will dampen the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to consider the matter again.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually made by changing ideas rather than by punching.
It was therefore enough for the miner to open her books, her files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and reject requests and supporting letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he could request a "public" debate by disregarding his views?
According to the vice-president, this word seems to designate only paid lawyers and not all Canadians; it represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does it especially because it rejects the brutal way of the miner.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes in arguments, and not on what many people perceive as a persecution-hunt (persisting the " public debate " ), Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to the authors of Noir Canada urging them to stop using this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to hold a debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss people who dislike the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under much persecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unmeasured persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he wants, he does not want to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is high time that governments put in place devices that limit this type of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It particularly foresees: better control by the elected parties of their implementation, of new mechanisms aimed at ensuring the reimbursement of the invested public money, of new provisions to contain the number of excluded houses the lack of payment, as well as a right of control over wages paid to the leaders of the relief companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on the American daily life will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in the mood of investors.
The last hour they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, which have acceded late to the negotiations, were more favourable to the agreement, but not forgetting to express their satisfaction at being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly that would enable the owners to keep their home and the salary of the leaders of the State-surviving companies.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, no one should be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read [show] that is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
He said that the option of not doing anything is not acceptable ".
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money dubious debts, risky and unspoiled assets from the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble which first led to the sinking of mortgage risk credits before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a freezing of liquidity and abandonment of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have been out of stagnation since Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only secured by the government rather than purchased.
In order to clean up everyone's asperities in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to bear losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would attempt to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote from Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will get shares in the relief companies that will benefit it dividends in case of profits and that it will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying embargo procedures for housing obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and on metal compensation paid to the leaders of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote by the House of Representatives today and the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all its efforts, it is not yet certain that its plan will be adopted.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both by Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber finance commission, told his voters that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand."
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not that of taking advantage of the taxpayers. "
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is encouraging a small group in Congress, presented the problems differently, but came to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention by the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had refused to purchase its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost 2 billion euros (US$ 2.9 billion) during the crisis of venture real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said the Dutch Minister of Finance yesterday, Wouter Bos.
On the other hand, we have recovered a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that the savers and families will now appreciate that the times are uncertain."
During this time, across the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank in the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than EUR 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be the one to buy the British bank’s branches and bank accounts.
The Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes so long represented his triumph.
The American actor with a lovely smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His smell, sensitivity and an obvious talent would also have removed him from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83, due to lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom it seemed a lot and who was long considered a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, of a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of American dream.
Without excessive ego, last mark of quality.
Because in it was projected a whole country in love with self-made man, the warrior of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before winning in theatre, on television and soon in cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the driver who ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star also disappear with him, allergic to the world scandals of the show that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, while his great roles are intertwined on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual movement parades through it.
Many memories return to memory like the cute cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we remind your sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone to the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly manganette in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar to the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat to the character in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who valued him in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during their career.
Young people know him primarily thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on low-orthodox ice.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final role of godfather of the Irish Mafia on Sam Mendes Road to Perdition in 2003, the rizo was rizo.
Contrary to several film legends that left the race quite soon, Newman stayed a lot in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its fronts and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, humorously considered it " as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that he judges his performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young galan than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed his true sexual sensitivity not well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his film to Harry and Son in 1984, a work of shame and sadness.
" Among the numerous tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (they had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, deeply saddened: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legend career, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protestant against Hollywood's excesses.
We've seen a lot of his face reigning over vinegar sauce boots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, though it began as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: " Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the race of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce in the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing significant damage fraud, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor ' s Office, the funds obtained in public procurement were used for their own purposes by justifying on many occasions the fulfilment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in their total of some 65 million HUF - partially stopped in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public procurement with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the accusation, most bills were false.
For this they obtained the Talonaires in the Józsefvaros District market and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the falsified invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour by the Balaton Superior Region where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for his consumption and served as a model for the invoices that were presented, among others, in the contests of the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City of Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Sides and his accomplice András ..ri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports needed to obtain public grants.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomy center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Pont Egyesület Biztos Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people do not fit at once in that place.
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the very fancy bill manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft gastronomy centre. Because in the book hold of it - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he knew it was false documents.
"In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: besides the formal problems, he did not agree that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people do.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest organizes trips exclusively abroad, so that in the cash payment bill they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's billing practice.
In addition - as was known during the investigation - VAT also included in the document, although travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the services of that company were not loaded with 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, besides the hotel employees only extended invoices made to machine however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shippers" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company where they put on the bill as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the prosecution's investigations - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Equally due to formal differences - inadequate invoice format, false stamp - it is known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehertó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue those invoices.
The falsifiers did not pay any attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to have issued such a document.
They sent invoices consciously
Another group of false invoice manufacturers are those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialistak, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - According to the charge - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Likewise, Zuschlag and its accomplices, the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, who in 2003 provided invoices of approximately HUF five million to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, for later the invoices were cancelled but they forgot to record in their documents to this entity.
The following group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have any connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian Delta Trio SL with a fictional headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the trade in fuel and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian who Ivan Kubatov should have also issued the company-related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he shipped to the company invoices for Atlasz, for Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány by charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they received no work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since, at the request of his accomplice, counsel Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of companies for organizations associated with Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for Y-Generáció.
Kubatov on behalf of the Cash Investment, the Delta Trió, the Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade gave in total 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri command company to issue fictitious bills used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they obtained HUF 500,000 respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
For this not to be discovered, five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Arpád Kemecsei had at the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main accused himself, János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions have so far not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so until now.
The question is: What interest does it have to do with it? Perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - Socialists came to an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even take offense, since in order to alleviate his prison conditions he applied for house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, which never returned the money, pass freely or at least can wait for the sentence in their own home, he has no chance of that.
Psychology of Overlays: Why Do We Spend More Money?
The auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
The neurologists and economists of the University of New York discovered the neurological bases - economics of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in a auction and while being examined through the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (MRI) the active brain areas of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could earn money , but during auctions, where it is fundamental element to bet more than the other, by losing the game increased the operation of the complex called stratum located below the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "auto-prime" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, increased betting is explained as a prevention not to cause an intense reaction to the stratum.
To substantiate its theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups wagered against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members betted.
The other group was promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, even those members of the group lost that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that one highlighted the triumph and the other the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to wager even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
Those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and preventing risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York University's economic faculty.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
Around the world some five hundred million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
It is estimated at 100,000 in this country, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the sick do not know they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread in two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with contaminated water or food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vagina humor, saliva).
It is recommended that travellers be protected by vaccine against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after eating the infected food, manifested by a general poor condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear in the skin and white of the eyes jaundice, excrement becomes clear, dark urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people die in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected is treated pharmacologically.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of the infected do not know you are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical control is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are now about 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if it is discovered in time, it is possible to eliminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
On 30 September it was World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and to the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less who they believe in God?
According to a recent study, religious faith has a soothing effect that also alleviated the death of martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
Within the framework of this singular experiment, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists applied electric shock while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was found that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the research series in which academics also participate in scientists, philosophers and theologians from different departments of the University.
The analysis was carried out as follows: a sharp instrument was attached to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to set their eyes on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, work of 17th century Sassoferrato and the Lady of the Armain of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary's spectacle would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scan, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during this period while observing the painting of religious theme or the other.
Catholics stated that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they calmed down and in their hearts peace reigned."
By observing the religious theme picture, they felt about 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so striking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person who feels very positively, as if by a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases truly change our personality" - Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of her size were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You're what you say about yourself
On his tenth birthday Google can say: you can find it in people's pocket, as well as in the sky above their heads; you know where their holidays were spent, what doctors visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this isn't enough yet.
On the other hand, skeptics who parallel orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as many personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of Google's founders: "We gather in a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google’s leader, the company even after ten years of work that turned the World is still in the initial phase of the commitment to be able to handle all the information.
To the question what is going to happen within five years Schmidt replied this way: I would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would be best for me?" - However, the software will not be able to answer questions that seem so simple until there are enough information from users.
Not all netizens are aware that the search keywords, IP addresses and pages are stored accurately during their web browsing.
Thanks, for example, to Custom Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more customised searches - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based on, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if you take advantage of my data against myself, collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are worried about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases the potential represented by the company is what can be feared and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justified cases also give third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information on its Web page, Orkut, to identify the paedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who are concerned about people's rights, in May, were relieved when the company, together with the EFF, an organization for the defence of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that was right in their dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google cannot be obliged, through any of the points of the constitution to supply any information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to obtain its pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about 50,000 Web addresses and about a thousand wanted phrases, but without obtaining individual user search lists, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: those who fear to supply their personal data because they think their privacy, their private life is damaged when they start using Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "vant-garde corporation", not so to its rival, the Microsoft, labeled by its Windows as conqueror of the World, as much as they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and looks more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that occurred precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional traces behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have profile on many collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers list of their music habits, then you can include them in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are stored in Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
We can know many cases of what turns out, for example, that the bride, seeing the flow of photographs the next morning of the common friends, finds out with whom she spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because this writes her sincere opinion on the company's management blog: one thing is safe, the definition of private life was fully revalued.
The "on line" life of a person is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the behavior of the youth of our day.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least pretends to avoid Google’s monopoly, can do it (e.g. starting with the Scroogle that uses Google’s search system, but does not leave any trace).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but they can replace Google's "on line" applications, from text editing software to image and read news applications with alternative versions that do not connect with giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day that Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising surfaces threaten advertising agencies' revenues, while services that are increasingly introduced cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will also find the alarming contradictions: for example, the senior management flatly rejected the protest of employees after doubling the price of the company's child care, considered too much to be the unlimited number of food of employees, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement filtered out all information that violated the good morale and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but that only when it is ready to work, which is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years will be able to revolve around the world: while some believe that Google's draft scanning and archive books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it can provide a good raw material for writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, the novel of Cory Doctorow's popular, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only of Google's data can be alarmingly described well.
Two minors helped clear the traces of the author of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
The police questioned two minors about Ozd's double murder who, according to suspicion, helped clear the traces of the crime - said the spokesperson of the General Public Order Commissioner of Borsod province on Tuesday.
Young people recognized the crime they were charged with, and are currently accused of crime offenders.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - can stand up for freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in custody since Sunday.
He was accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large amount to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a company in Ozd, where he killed him and then killed the victim's nine-year-old daughter.
According to information from the IMF, the young man had prepared himself long before to commit the crime, for he committed murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police analyze with an expert on the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State that within a few months wishes to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Polish supply has been the highest among those offered by the stakeholders of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that among the stakeholders the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a participation of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the ever deeper international financial crisis speak of a "second September 11th".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the President of the United States - The Republic of Rome - the President has not even been able to obtain the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose aim is to give him a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", of which multimillionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11th".
According to part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo's view, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States led the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is growing and this will affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congress vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
You can't ignore this threat - points out Geneva's Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw life belts off the reeling financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if, as dominoes collapse more banks, then they will no longer be sufficient new funds, nor will new improvisations.
It is necessary in the long term for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received only over 100 billion euros on Monday - recalls the Vienna Der Standard, adding that the concerns that, as the Americans have done, European taxpayers must also pay a lot of money to solve the crisis are becoming more and more real.
The EU has so far not been seriously concerned with the crisis that is going on as a summit for the Old Continent .
"Savers" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid greater harm?
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the baby
What would be the best method of developing technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, that of beekeepers.
In an amazing project presented at the Japan CEATEC, the beekeepers provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic management system of cars type BR23C imitating nature, to which the characteristics of the beeches were given, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each baby creates its own private ovalated space that actually looks a lot like our safe capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the compound eyes of beeches that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eyes, engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid the collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the beeches, modifying the direction by turning to the necessary extent the wheels.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is completely instinctive.
"If not, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and of the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable interior layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bee.
This process must be carried out in an open and close the eyes.
However, unlike beeches, the movement cannot go up, down or diagonal, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the turn direction of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for beekeepers to dodge other beeches, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotating movement and the acceleration further the braking.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is greater, which means that they have a longer life span than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is instinctive and intelligent reaction, not data processing capacity, nor much less storage capacity.
This device in every second should only process some input signals and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
You don't need gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into the models manufactured in series within ten years.
Another possibility for your application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding any obstacles in his path.
You already have a name for this dear child
The written version of the $700 billion financial rescue package bill has been prepared to be applied in various phases in order to purchase bad bank credits.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to the Eastern Coast schedule during the new consultations that lasted until mid-Saturday, the congress leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion financial rescue package in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American Congress, claiming that the agreement is only to be formalized in a document.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the result of the commitment stated: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning it back to the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 p.m. on Monday morning, according to Central Europe schedule), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the bill called the Emergency Law for Economic Stabilization of 2008, the first Monday will vote for the U.S. Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also held news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson for the White House.
The programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration to spend all 700 billion dollars on buying low-quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this amount, the Ministry of Finance will buy credit fund securities, poor rating and the other $100 billion target depends on the President's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion may be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: you can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and credit fund securities, as well as other "veneous"-type credits as well.
The purchase may be made either in auctions or directly - informed competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, by which companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated: The law thus ensures the necessary financial means, that up to $700 billion can be reached to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, to deal with the purchase of bad financial means, their assurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some major financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and expect State aid may have the official limitation of their compensation, which the American argot simply calls gold parachute.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, in addition limitations depend on the form of assistance of the Ministry of Finance.
Limitation means that if the ministry buys under a auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachute unless the bank's failed chief retirees.
By buying the bad credits directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the bosses' compensations are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that will be in effect a legal limitation for the general directors' incomes - said the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they may ultimately gain even with the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the bill in the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return to taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
This is not what we American citizens were given, that is, they are not protecting the dollars of taxpayers - declared the Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat of Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged him by the very ones who are responsible for the collapse of the Wall Street.

Internal sales prices in the processing industry increased at least by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8%), due firstly to the increase of 4.6 per cent per month of bags and belts and the increase of 2.5 per cent of footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the chemical production branch prices (1.6 per cent).
There was a decrease in price in the petrochemical sector (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the processing sectors of wood (0.1 per cent).

In the rest of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent an important weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, primarily as a result of the increase in official prices from 1 July.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the highest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4%).
There was an increase of 13.2 per cent in the metal processing sector, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of determining weight, there was an increase of 11 per cent.

Will next year no longer require visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian agreement on visa waiver to enter into force on 12 January - the foreign minister spoke of this in Chicago, in front of Hungarian residents there.
In his opinion "practically everything depends on the electronic system of access and control on the other side of the Atlantic in time."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the premise of entry will disappear, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin must register.
From today on, the Hungarian diplomacy chief is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing over the Median Cross to the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisors of the candidates for the presidency, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties assured their support for the government's 700 million-dollar banking aid programme on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and the administration, after several marathon days, announced in the morning of Sunday: an agreement was reached on principles on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and defusing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, when economic issues were put in the foreground, Obama again gained some advantage and disappeared from McCain's advantage that he had gained after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy to the vice-presidentship.
In a Detroit campaign rally held last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) is in danger of employment, savings from you. besides whole industries and stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to describe McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview given to ABC McCain explained that "we'll all swallow this to hard pains (...) but doing nothing simply isn't a viable way."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control commission to the fine minister and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, but he consulted with the minister on a daily basis.
The president of Congress Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group themselves became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a reddish coalition.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Revolution of Bavaria devours its parents" analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken over.
The Christians for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and now precisely these modern citizens are the ones behind them.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the whole Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been planned for almost ten years now ended: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the aforementioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years now, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases possibilities and also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself they became the most conscious, most critical and most stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones who have gone further than the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrial ones, the ones who have a bachelor's degree and the graduates.
This was the case for less than 40 percent of support for the CSU.
Die Presse (depresse.com)
The Conservative newspaper of Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved in coalition matters" - deals with the confusing situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions for negotiation, the greens yet do not wish to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders hardly let any of their decks see.
Werner Faymann, president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question pending that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, in the vice-canciller position.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer cautiously reacted to red offerings.
He said that cooperation would probably not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
It is still open in the party if they will choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the black-red coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," said Haider.
Jároka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, and its host is France, who is also President-in-Office of the European Union this year.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organisations attended the meeting.
Jároka - according to the press bureau of the Fidesz group of Members in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"Most Roma young people have not finished middle school and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can obtain university degrees."
Jároka further stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role to play in the prevalence of other human rights.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Euro MP, these issues need to be widely conscious of both Roma and non-Gypsies.
As soon as the school starts, a Gypsy student will have more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the European Parliament, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of school segregation immediately, so it is of fundamental importance that the proper implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is properly complied with.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children should be given the opportunity to guarantee democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Jároka demanded.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be taken on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein
Despite the severe electoral defeat, no head has yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, for the time being the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their positions, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the special convention of the party to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so-called "two" met: they did not hold onto their posts.
In this way they sought to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and its basic organization, who one day after the "Tsunami bávaro" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, one year after the blow against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopolie" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to prevail, in the future they will certainly have to make a coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the restructuring of the party, vice-president Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that initiates negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was taken for the blow of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly removed from the stage to the ambitious local politics.
CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will also be given an active role Stoiber who has been moving the ropes in the background so far, the former head of provincial government and former president of the CSU qualified on 28 September as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his view they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel herself as well.
Following the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be a chancellor unless they are able to enhance the CSU together which played a key role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that he could hardly conceal his disappointment by failure, the losses of the CSU will not adversely affect the great Berlin coalition.
This is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After the elections on Sunday, there will be no opposition Member in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexandr Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE that sent 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognize the electoral outcome.
While the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, composed of 10 per cent and 10 deputies, has not opposed more than a decade ago, before the elections of yesterday's united opposition under the name of the United Nations Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time would "allow" the entry of some members of the opposition into parliament.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which increasingly depends on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline passing through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which did not give permission to enter Lukashenko and other high-level politicians for having a political regime considered antidemocratic.
It was a sign of distancing when the OSCE, in assessing the electoral campaign, placed more emphasis on positive phenomena and not on errors - such as the prohibition of participating in a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary Monday report criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
In the view of the opposition, however, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released, and Minsk was prepared for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already considered the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backward, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - has been declared to our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime is afraid to allow the entry of even one opponent into that weightless parliament."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations in view of the results, rather it tries to get the voters their message about the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes a lot of problems because we should print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before their distribution, but even so I see that more and more they support the change among older people too - said Milinkevich, alluding to the Lukashenko regime, which believes its main result is the creation of social security, they do not consider it appropriate even the retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that "seems to the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers opposed the opposition politician described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe not in words but in facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, you have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the History of Chigi Palace that put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but since today it starts with this measure against who files and then goes to the bar to have a coffee on working hours.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors," says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, more productively, more presence and more services," said the minister.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is open.
This is Reformism," says Brunetta again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
No resistance has been found by employees, the secretary-general says: "It has been a change shared by workers and there has been collaboration by them."
Finally, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and midnight.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the High School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences for diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people to work in one year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make public administration more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8-10 years have been double in relation to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
For now millions of public employees have joined in opposing the rules of the Brunetta decree by acceding to the request supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absenteeism of work due to the causes of illness – writes the consumer association – the people of 'the vague workers' is on the rise.
It is indeed millions in Italy that employees of the correct and productive public administration who have joined to declare war to the illegitimate norms of the decree."
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of economic treatments added due to illness due to service would be answered; the extension of the time zones in which medical check-ups of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions sought by the Minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Criminal prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
By 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes nearly twice as many deaths from homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, the Anmil today celebrates in all provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention at work," says President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association Mutilated and Invalid by Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses his "great appreciation for the ongoing associative effort towards prevention at work, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness of public opinion".
"It has been manifested, a 'sufficient', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, provokes the cries of the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular meaning takes the numerous initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For its part, House President Gianfranco Fini has emphasized "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to urgently end."
"Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away the number of white deaths equally impressive," noted the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not really want this "decrease tendance" to mean less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy exploits.
"We believe that at general level there is still too little to tackle the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our view - Mercandelli has highlighted - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school ".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as far as communication and public awareness are concerned.
But, above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for the victims of work" and the "aid derivation towards which the system is heading in recent years".
"The aim is to restore the guarantee of insurance to the worker - he has added - because the fate of the person who is injured does not have to depend on the gift made by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers under charge, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a long time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
It refers to the European Commission, which in a press release in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable musical devices and high sound cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific evidence – following EU responsibility – emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have a step forward with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that caused it.
"Scientists - concludes executive Ue - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical devices and related apparatus."
At present, there is already a European security standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concerns increase as hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these damage by resorting to solutions such as reduced levels and noise exposure time.
In its opinion, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical instruments are heard at a high volume (but of 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limit on the maximum noise allowed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, the accounts will be held in June.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Fututo of the capital of Rome", which was established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission discussed the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the board and the municipal council evaluated analyses and projects, in order to present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bull" of the Municipality and of its neighbour Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to emphasise German – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council will be able to come to an end.
There is no other position of roles, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – the speaker announces – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To whom the Commission accuses of uselessness, since its opinions are not binding, German replied: "Everything depends on the work that will be able to carry out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be essential.
The policy is almost always crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that return to manifest themselves..
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Rome's ambassador would also like to point out that "this Commission is neither useless nor trivial: it is absolutely free, it does not cost Roman citizens a euro and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital expresses".
For German, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking in a spirit of unity to its future."
A future which, precise to the steward of Rome" would not be limited only to the current municipal boundaries but would look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and should develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in being independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and tube relations (as he does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
"This person is filled with ambitions.
Obama has a great stone face: he thinks he won the highest position of the nation he has had two governors and five black senators!".
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racial attacks and don't answer the voters' question: will you be a good president? And there are also polls; they all say that Obama wins and has a good advantage.
In this case too, there is one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper from the Mississippi, in the depths of the South of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the cabin we will know who will vote for the American patriot.
Get out one side of the American mentality covered to the last.
"Say whatever you want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or about McCain."
There are people who swear: if you get to win Obama, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
Despite all these reasonings, however, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kicks in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Also, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak spot.
Who will take over George W's position will have a huge duty to develop.
Use, the economic collapse also makes you feel for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "murder" for the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to carry out the newspaper is a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the majority of the public understands is not intended to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism predominates today on the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the website is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views such as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists are warning has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope of "doing something good" by journalism.
The biggest break today in American journalism is between who directs the newspapers – i.e. the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage falls to 23 per cent.
For some this has to do with "working security."
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a "take it or leave it" issue.
The directors receive almost always good wages, while the editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, one after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are "sick" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPLA BEING GOTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the area of investigation into the contra- pact relating to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of his arrest process , last week, he obtained house release, turning it into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked for the real estate to travel through the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (by which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that he is being accused.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago by the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 million-dollar rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this one, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation yesterday's New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, ever more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to "the Washington ones" and to the world of finance, especially strong in the central and southern states.
The soul, in fact, that has become preeminent with the vote of those who spoke at the beginning.
This is just mentioned is just one example of the mutations, of the major mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Whether in the United States or in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to work as a accelerator for incubation phenomena that are solidified and brought to light with the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the re-upgradation, extraordinary re-activation, of the dual status-sovereign category in relation to a type of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance, if, strong financial relations with the outside, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in one country and in one state are much more committed.
He who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern him: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or has little to say: the crucial test is the European Union which, as always, divides between different interests and different state strategies, does not succeed in deciding any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, of new rules and above all the grant of funds: since the time it arrives in the court, it is only the state that owns the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market will likely and no organization will ever have the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect tune, with the greatest importance as long as the new development of the economy tends to attribute a very related factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of immaterials, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future would have to do more and more with unimportant things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, look at, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a confined space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as a sovereign certainly has many more letters about who he is not, and to whom he has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second novelty, but I'm predicting a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably speak Politics and Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective consciousness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who can take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of disbelief for existing leadership, of inadequately-relevated economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inappropriate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in an increasing number.
It seems to progress ever more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before its actions are the same as those of the social elites so far at the height, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the inclusive exception of the term, having made the same time and being more strange to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short words, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative departure in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American congress against Bush (and also layered with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with).
The impression is that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say none, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent, what is taking shape today are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and shakes potentially in dismeasures.
In front of all this talk about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walking on walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has approached a lot.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to paste a body of 100 kilograms onto a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a spaghetti stack,” explains Zhong Lin Wang at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geese, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and strip paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "is easily taken off the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
PATH BY PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Limiting Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat conductors and electric current.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - Berkeley University in California is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article by American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibres as self-cleaning hair of dust during the movement on a surface to maintain always a perfect adherence.
Fats: never with fruit juice
Attention to the apple juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, mostly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken simultaneously with some drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed as fresh as associated with the taking of some medicines David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London, who since the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of apple, apple and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The apple juice was already under accusation because some antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products were held responsible for increasing at toxic levels.
PHARMACOS A RISGOS – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mixture and to pay attention to what is drinking in the case a drug is being taken, such as Diasepam or Metadone.
Not only POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active substances inhibited by apple and other juices.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"These findings are generally pointed out to the various agencies of the international and national drug that eventually provide to change the information notes of the drug.
That is why we should always read the package leaflets of medicinal products that are taken, and if there is something that is not clear to us, let us not be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly," said the expert from the agency Ansa.
The Novel of Economy to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of trade and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush administration decisions on economics and foreign policy.
A few months after the 11 September 2001 attack on Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years came reprobate to the economy, but has now proved accurate.
"I am surprised and a little upset at the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom quickly disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "greatly valued economist", but also a very aggressive, particularly critical divulner against the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the OpenOffice.org 3.0 launch, the open-source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year's work on the part of volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the less coarse revised interface, other more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format(Open Document Format) 1.2,the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also put to multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphics processing module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create documents "hybrid PDF", which accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in several users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the drafting of texts, each employee is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English mirror since Friday.
Furthermore, for Windows and Mac OS, as the suite is normally also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can also send the installation cd at home or at work.
And if the free theme can be a hook for home dissemination, it is in business field that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, already able to have several projects done in public administration and in schools.
And there is not even the realities that provide an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video write the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eat in the case of the known Access is the program that allows you to work on the base date; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth doping case
New positive case in the tour of France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third graded and winner of the best ranger.
To give the news is the site of the L'Equipe newspaper.
Kohl, 26 years old is the fourth positive runner to the Third-generation Epoch, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also those of the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl blood champions enters among those performed in recent weeks in the laboratory of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place on the Tour and will be angry against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl’s positive doping at the Third-generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, awarding the remedy of the best climber.
Immigrants:new YORK TIMES IS QUESTIONED, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy as an immigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted itself to the debate on the topic of racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where they record "more integration and more work" but also the country's highest anti-immigrant feeling and the highest support of the North League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation loved by the League also tightens the barriers to immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal persons is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trend marked by the Pope that by the President of the Republic: "Gorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to combat racism."
Students victims of expensive rental, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the last Sunia survey, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large proportion of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to sustain – explains the head of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities strong demand has completely distorted the market to such an extent as to trigger a process of widespread increase to residents."
Aside from the fact that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without a canon limit, under related leases.
For Sunia, there is a need for extraordinary interventions which, through the revision of tax taxation, can regulate prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Faira) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, they serve EUR 250/280 per bed in a double room and between 370 and 500 per individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for an individual room and 450 per bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinematà).
You save only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros per one bed and 450 per one single room in the area Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for one bed you are served 300/450 euros, for one room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed you are served 250/350 euros, at least 350 per one individual.
in the most girls cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and extra-Communitys is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Adios to the old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historic rooms
Historical cinemas close by favoring the Multiplexes.
"A city without cinematographic halls in a blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effective what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of large methics in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory," it's as if a friend died, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place was shared and so much emotion," observes the director of the new cinema Paradise, the film that 20 years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury in Cannes, which counted the poetry of a provincial cinema hall and the nostalgia for the way of living the film that may be lost forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of traders, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and the majority of the rooms in the main cities are mostly: 10 minus in Florence, 9 minus in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 minus in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffering from closures are as first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 less cinemas, following Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the advent of multiplex, it is the same as these three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new methonic cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romaña.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec," it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the methics.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year".
Interesting to the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first such in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono room is in the historical center that on the outskirts.
Among the proposed rules are tax facilitation measures for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators may enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking rates.
"It's an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting on stand-up other measures.
It is true, that in contrast to the extra power of the methonics, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because today the public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that was always important to me: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to realize the "New Cinema Paradise", which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of the already closed National Way, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, not to see the posters negregated by the dust, I turn to the other side."
Bond between politics and 'drangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the municipal elections for the stakeholders to the Pyromalli cosca."
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the consignor and vice-signor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association.
Arrested also Gioaccino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already sentenced by mob criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any legal and moral rule, and in good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to counsel Piromalli.
"The Mafia family would have been allowed - the judges write - to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian Regional Board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'dragheta, heroes who keep themselves clean'.
The arrests this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the cutting of heads of the Mafia family Piromalli.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Ombudsman, of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballotage in May 2006, had been elected head of a right center coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call into question the Deputy Minister of the Interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of organizing everything for a political issue, but the judges in the warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to request the variation of the A3 road project.
Of the environmental intercepts made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the public administration's elections on the interests of Mafia families."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage
It is an extinct site that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the world's largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources upon which big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from sea movements has been studied for 100 years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of low oil in 1980, the idea of using marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the wave movement of the sea.
This would be twice as much of the production currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Giants to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years from now to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Cevron is studying ocean energy technology – the spokesperson of a company associated with the ha to the US oil colloquium to the Wall Street Journal – and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is on obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a rather important signal, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to follow the path of the energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicates an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
To produce long-scale energy, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a good system of bonding between them.
The force of the waves, which moves the good up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four such implants in development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping centre and parking, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there is tides, causes the turbine pallets to rotate, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, now deserves the potential of tides.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and an investment of 35 million is planned for 2009.
