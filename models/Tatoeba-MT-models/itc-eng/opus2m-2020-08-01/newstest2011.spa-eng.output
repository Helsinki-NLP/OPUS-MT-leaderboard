What's the matter? The ČSSD in Prague doesn't know either Voldemort or the bakery
The new Councillors of ČSSD in the capital will, it seems, have to overcome the obvious language barriers in order for the components of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed colleagues in the SDG.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new Council of ČSSD to check their knowledge of the language marked slang that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's political flower and cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most famous characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
"I am rather a novel in Prague politics," said the Culture Councillor Lukáš Kaucký during the terminology review of "colegius".
And as far as the political veteran was concerned, Karel Březina reacted the same way.
They may know the concept of golf hockey.
"Maybe it's the only expression you've ever asked me that I use from time to time."
"If not, usually in slang employment."
Of the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June before the SDG vote congress, the writing chose six examples, in particular those that are particularly related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "more Prague golf hole", "go to the bakery", "to the bull's nut", "capital betrayal" and "to lick".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who in future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
"I don't get into these things, nor do I intend to value how the democratic civics amuse themselves."
"What matters to me is how we will understand how to implement our programmes," he said.
As it has been said, Councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized that the earlier title is an expression on an influential entrepreneur and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" doesn't say anything; the only term that was successful in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the White Tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds, "but I know it for the news."
"I'm going to have to take a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the Environmental Councilman Lukáš Plachý.
Later, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý really know where to find that character; moreover, they suspect the meaning of "go to the pastry."
"I think it means going to a Prague company"; it soon reveals to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge got them from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-democrats there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but we really don't seem to have anything like it."
"Better, between us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or we make word games with names," says the president of ČSSD Prague, Petr Hulinský, whose party partners are called Hulda.
"At school I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina confesses his own nickname.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and worked.
For his party partners, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the election deceptions during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulinský doesn't like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this president.
"The doctor of the rights of the bitches" he seems to recall that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava police academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of “brides”, as published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an advanced age, can't work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the town.
"Men rarely suffer such otherwise."
"It also does not isolate healthy young women because they help in work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of West Africa Burkina Faso, deals with a special residence of over 100 women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information brochure that should help avoid witch hunting.
However, this has a stick.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," warns the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantages of written awareness.
The accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbouring country in Burkina Faso, Amy Hemmah died last week, 72 years, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news came on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a unfortunate cluster of circumstances.
According to its version, the woman was caught in the oil used for ritual anointings.
He was caught in flames when the group wanted to "extract the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of the "brides" supports people from all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "The devourers of human souls always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is attempting to pacify witch hunting, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a broad hunt for witches who had allegedly been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself through black magic."
"In order to help him bring the chamanas from nearby Guinea that, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, were taken to force men and women randomly chosen among the Gambian peoples to the property of the president in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in his report.
At the farm, arrested people had to drink a pot of herbs with allucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detained persons.
The Bakala tenant: warm up with coal stoves and sign a higher rental
The man, aged and weak, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnet" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-storey leases: his own, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving sentence.
The three of them just got rid of the rental liberalisation.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay from next year 4.100 krona for a two-room apartment with second-class separate kitchen.
"In addition, there is no hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler", he shows with his finger the man in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains a half angry, half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz civil association, which qualified the new terms of rent as "incorrect and indecent", recommends tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, when it will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But in the face of this, man only makes a magnet.
"Every one says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great testing laboratory for liberalization.
After New Year it will occur with the vast majority of the apartments that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
For this reason, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, Tuesday at 9 o'clock, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to him is a machine to take number.
"To rent 2011", you can read in a bright button of your touch screen.
When you push it, a paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost no time to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an old marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as old times: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the renters' pockets of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase in the rental of between 15 and 38 per cent.
On November 18, a special window is opened in the customer service centre for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," the workers who are in it, after a brief doubt, respond when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old floors for Bakala miners are the most delicate themes in the area.
Prior to the elections, the vice-president of the Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from ČSSD, has already treated them high and clear, and now appears continuously in the newspapers of the area.
" Twenty years later I want a new ground."
"I didn't even get the damn bath dish changed," the man mentioned in the introduction was unraveled.
According to the workers, at the moment they come more than nothing retired to check if they get a discount on the rental if they sign on time, as promised by the special RPG offer.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half of the discount on the rent in February.
However, the window of "liberalization" mining certainly does not manage to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only asked for the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people," says the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and its tables to hold individual meetings on contracts where necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on rental, the matter shall be settled by an independent judge.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed and fully in accordance with the law," cautions RPG on its pages.
"Here you won't judge anyone," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to the courts," he says.
But immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek alerts you in ways that you don't sign, so maybe people wait," he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rentals still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rental.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in four billion apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, the figure will increase to 5,200 million.
The large screen hanging from the roof, in front of the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be at a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter", it is indicated on the screen.
Only increase by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low quantities of 19.66 krona per square metre", says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not suddenly affect rents, but will increase between four and eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the increase of the rental (see graph) again on the floors, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rental upward agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch.Design company.
No one would say that it also hides a small nursery in its interior with everything itself to such facilities: colored walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the sons of the employees of Arch.Design can come to her.
The architectonic project company Arch.Design, whose study came out of numerous known buildings of Brno, thought from the first drafts of the building Avriopoint to include a space for its mini-guard.
The company works around 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Designs his workers as part of his social program.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with child care.
The mini-guard was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guard is financed through the European Social Fund within the framework of the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding (a total of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mini-guardy running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the request for funding contributed to the company Economy Rating.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day care is provided to children without age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since this is a "mini-storey", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children at the same time, even if the shifts come more during the day.
The operation of the day-care facility is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the day-care facility, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the contents of the mini-guard programme are comparable to the usual pre-school curriculum.
In it children not only play, but also receive a quality education: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach up to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their place of work.
Thus, parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the sign companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of staff.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. See the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals called it "the house of bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade that reminds the scales and omnipresent gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with oniric lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, there is a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thoughted order.
At night, the whole facade of the house seems even more impressive, as it is illuminated so that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpent and the twist of forms continues to surprise us also inside it.
Corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the brooms, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signs.
The Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample neighborhood in number 43 of Passeig de Grácia's lively shopping street, emerged from the remodeling of a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on bringing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their plans of the project, ornaments emerged for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Milá House and the Güell de Gaudí park, where other parts of it are found.
Due to its organic form, the premises soon after their completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific opening mechanism of the windows began to call it "the house of the woods".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation ventilators and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange its inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not at all respect the construction rules of the moment and did not allow himself to be influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although obviously in it the data indicated on the expected reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so impressed by the result it requested to be corrected.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public yard.
The arrangements were never made, but on the contrary: only fifteen days after the city council request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
The owner himself was installed on the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the living rooms and a larger group can thus communicate without any problems, without giving up the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with both colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which instead absorb sun rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment of the accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits, they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and expanded visits to the common area and to the Butterfly, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the price of entering other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with your lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit you at home.
How the mattress and the somier are chosen: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pumping frame for the bed; what really confers its quality on a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the somier.
First of all, they must complement themselves perfectly to adapt to specific users.
Many elements, including weight, height, state of health and owner's sex, come into play during the election.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the somier are located is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the channels in the center are not properly aired and above, they are on a firm basis, they keep within the moisture. Even wet can appear below.
When choosing a bed, habits are also influenced.
Whoever has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have problems feeling well on a lower and harder surface.
"Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here."
"For their crushed shoulders, heels, and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of vischoelastic."
"This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, so they get bad information from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadangziková, who specializes in the coated furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have been taking time preferring viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today is no longer a problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropic brand."
You don't have to be a NHL player anymore in order to appreciate viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimize your rigidity and form depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard game.
Just sleep better.
Viscoelastics also works as protection against lakes.
By choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
For individual rooms, e.g. singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple standard to calculate the width: when you lay your mouth up, you should have your hands comfortably shrinked towards the elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert at Cechu čalouník to dekoratér, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, which she teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each one needs his own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to assemble the dreamers at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with a spring interior of a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and smooths.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you sit on the mattress, you should certainly not notice the docks," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a specific type of somier.
The fully-hidden bedrooms, where the mattress and base are like Siamese, have no meaning in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your bottom, which is often done today.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will start to remind us of a large (and congested) tamiz.
For this reason, experts reject slogans that speak of a life of a mattress up to 25 years or even a life assurance.
However, everything has one but.
Therefore, sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take good care of cleaning and washing of the bottom, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattresses with zipper closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when opening them they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in the larger models (and by only one person) when raising the mattress may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In the bed, instead of a somier, do you have a firm table?
Never!
Like a lot for the beds designed to spend a night visiting.
However, it must do (if you don't already have them) ventilation holes on the table and should be used with a mattress with docks inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-arguable sheet tins containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses may be used (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber), although it is always better a somier with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets in the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Articulated sheet sumers should not be used with a spring mattress, since they do not react to the tilt.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the blades, shoulder protection may also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets so that they "round" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men with very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by the mattress manufacturers who, in the "male" ones, began to use a softer area precisely around their shoulders.
They also remember women, for which they put a softer area around their hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are crests with cross or tablet structure with the so-called multitortion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
It should also be borne in mind that, although you use the appropriate mattress and somier, if you use a bad pillow (large and "wet"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so they can relax the muscles themselves.
The appropriate size recommended is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying aside, the pillow must be at the same level (when combined with the somier with shoulder reinforcement or softer area of the mattress) than the height of the shoulders.
The modern mattresses have something to do with the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use natural materials more often or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which the polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils such as rice or soy.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers employ soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the mattress base, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with vegetable extracts of breeze, so that the mattress's bottom absorbs the heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the bottom.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warm.
Are your favorites currently?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, make them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities allows you to manufacture mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where your head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you from seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function often have a lower VAT, as they are considered health-care facilities.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's complicated to save on mattresses and dreams.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a foam with memory memory attached to the bottom by 11,990 crowns.
The second one gets free.
The age of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during the takeoffs astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body has a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent lakes from occurring, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foams and similar ones.
Increasingly parents use tracking devices to control their children
Fear for children keeps more and more people thinking about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková disappeared.
For the moment the device has the approximate size of a box of eyeglasses, but will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the missing Anička case and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that it is not about spying, but about another means of reducing the chances of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In your opinion, children should always know what the "cajita" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to take it, he will simply throw it away.
"Even younger children show great creativity when they intentionally lose certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"Before, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," says Bočková.
In your opinion, it is questionable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will practically always check whether the child has any type of electronic device that can reveal its location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is being extended, it will also look for them, since their sale will certainly be made with much publicity."
"In such cases, offenders always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the event of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which provides follow-up services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence can be helpful.
"The device can be configured to regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If you suffer damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices incorporate a tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and stays motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, in which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that for the moment they are devices with a size similar to a cell box or smaller mobile phones.
So they can be lost.
According to Pilin from Macro Weil, that is why tests are currently being performed with devices that appear to be a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or identify it after a while, which can make the police take time," he adds.
Although tracking devices are carried in the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough matches to surround the entire Czech Republic, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of match to arrest explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added to its arsenal 224 kilometres of wick.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the match is two years, four to the top.
The army bought the explosive match to the STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
General staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometres of wick per year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnics, with which MF DNES was contacted, it is nevertheless decided that, in this case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all the generals, senior officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want to be exempt, nor did the Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Picek army.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend 60 kilometres of match.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two metres of match, the army would have with the new purchase (including adding the consumption of the units of engineers or specials) sufficient stocks for the above 225.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices for money are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I can't understand that I buy such amounts of wick repeatedly."
"But it's your decision and they will certainly know why they act like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," says STV Group Commercial Director Jan Děcký.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometres of mecha also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group indicates that the match only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, of two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, because of the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that when buying 445 kilometers of wick, he got a discount.
"We cost 60 per cent less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," said spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence shopping centre.
Just to compare: the annual mecha consumption of the police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the Second World War ammunition or the Soviet army left, has not been more than 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always request only the fair amount to exhaust the ammunition before their useful life is finished.
It was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable mold types can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in completing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czech army of 22,000 people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of miles of old macha will have to be eliminated, which is now being bought "barata".
So far I'm still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the competition "Empreneur of the Year" helped Lukáš Pytloun in selling the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition won the competition "Empreneur of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukaš Pytloun of Liberec.
His story of success seems to be taken out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad it was realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings I had with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit bought a house that was half collapsed composed of five floors.
Taking into account that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"Today, the price-quality relationship of the accommodation in our area moved me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income that he had invested in the building again, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he has been able slowly to open in Liberec four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisse, to which we sold our concept of franchise, and others are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said businessman number one last year.
"To this sale of licenses for opening hotels helped to a large extent to win the competition of the 'Empreneur of the Year'," says Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and around.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It certainly recommends to everyone that you try some company participating in the competition.
But it does not need to win, but participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live from contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I started to collaborate regularly."
The reputation associated with success, in his opinion, also included in employees,
Totally about seventy.
"I've seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that got the general recognition."
"It's not, much less, my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"It is only my name that appears in the foreground," says Lukaš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a year quieter than we've had in Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žхárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone "Company of the Year" contest last year at the "Slave House" in Prague.
The jury valued its efforts, with which it managed to convert a small technical workshop into Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight competition," says the winner of last year.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Žŏárský's father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not doubt too much; he resigned from his position in the company where he worked and, with a couple of companions, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they started specializing in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest automatic press manufacturer in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers begin to regard the Farmet brand as considerably better, but foreign partners also began to value the collaboration with a company that had a greater success in their country," says Karel Žхárský.
Last year maybe it wasn't just a sample of the euphoria of victory in Farmet.
It also gained recognition for trade performance until 2008 and partly from 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and to start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, do not get rid of such a situation."
"The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even we had some layoffs," says Karel Žхárský.
A viable company must sometimes take even unpopulated measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, although they were at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut costs was in research and development.
"With grants we have built a research and training centre, we strengthen the presence on the international market and we have obtained magnificent valuations at national fairs," says Žхárský.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement hopes that it will bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žхárský.
A survey that exposes ridiculous standards
The Absurdence survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which staff members can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than one third of the almost four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials could obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when carrying out a control of the insured's taxes," said ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the Absurdence survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations to be followed by companies and entrepreneurs in Czechia and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year is part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and also begins to create a hobby among the general public.
While last year's edition was attended by 3,000 voters, this year almost reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several remaining legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in the number of papers needed for the tax declaration we are first in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years now, simplification of business standards has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Czechia is in position 74a, i.e. eight posts worse than last year.
The Absurdez competition of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone may indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prime" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He gains the absurdity he receives more votes.
More than one hundred were presented for this year's survey, in particular 105 rules and regulations that do not make sense.
Examples were sent by both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals this year is published on the tender pages.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held early in November at Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event where political and social personalities are usually involved.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the competition Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continually puts employers in the way, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocorek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in the water of rubber.
In 2007, what was most disturbing to people was the employer's obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a job at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in number of votes in 2007, i.e. communication to the office of work by its foreign workers from work trips of up to 30 days, was removed in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is due.
The 2009 Absurdness was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two floor scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the contest of Hostodářské noviny is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"This way we want to support companies that are involved in the impact of their activity on the environment and which support socially responsible activities," said Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Company's main competition in 2010 companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, these are persons with disabilities, for example, in other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists throughout the Republic, for example, was the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor of funds to sponsor children with disabilities for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a station which is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the staff; therefore it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Chequia and in the Vodafone Company Competition of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc won the MiRyz Soft accounting company, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it is a priority for Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities can have the least possible impact on the environment," explains businesswoman Miluše Ryznarová.
The IT company manager Enlogit of the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboard; moreover, it supports work from home and its business events uses catering services from a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Fellowship Person in distress, which helps in particular the local Roma community," says the representative of the company Ondřej Suchý.
The Praní laundry company in čištění in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive subsidies in a special way that affects their pension funds, is also well placed.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, from the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company contest for the year who responded to the registration form questions and sent it automatically to the organizers before 15 August.
The organizers removed forms that were not complete or wrong from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the company competition responsible for the year, but are not disqualified from the "principal" Vodafone Company competition of the year."
"Individual applications for this contest are not allowed, since this is a subcategory of the company's main contest of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consulting.
Police arrested during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The Anti-Corruption Police made several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives paired a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It seems that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights so that the auctioned land would receive it from a specific interested party.
I had to pay Luboš G. half a million kroner for that.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribe during a public auction and public auction," Frávo told the chief prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment he cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
The way it could influence the public auction, given the limited official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesperson for the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund answered Právo's questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and went during a public auction.
"It's a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocation for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the land law" and is carried out when several stakeholders appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the summons, offer a value greater than that of their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the greatest offer," the Fund spokesperson explained.
Luboš G. had information on who was to be presented for the call and, since he was also interested because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to those interested in the field who would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of arrest, he had so much money on top.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former chief of PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of clearing the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained land provided for the construction of public infrastructure from the Fund, particularly where a large road should be built to the industrial area of Borská pole.
Later, he changed them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate by a house in the city's own historic center with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because otherwise blocked land would prevent construction.
Families are required to pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Homes will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
As a result, families will have to take several hundred crowns out of the portfolio from January onwards.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas by about 2%, in some cities must pay up to 10% more for the supply of water and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise of electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns more a year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers have reduced prices, as support for renewable energy production has increased, particularly photovoltaics.
However, gas is moderately fueled, especially when heating is most used and, therefore, consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are fuelled all over the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is planned mainly by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January by central heating about 50 crowns more a month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 crowns a year.
Residents in Prague must also bear an increase of 9% of the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, the Pragues will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 apartments rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which owns Ústí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase the rent from January to 100%.
The company will bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents from around 300,000 floors, could increase the next year by up to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in a way, because it makes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that lead to the end of young medical care drinkers under the age of 15.
Children who end up in the hospital continually to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors with such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to drink them."
"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages," Právo tells the pediatrician of Hořovice Hospital in the center of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they get a bottle to their father from the alacena, it can be whisky, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that it will soften with juice and not smell so much," he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually about Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, especially among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use spirits that they took at home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikan, 13 and 14-year-old drinkers usually appear in hospitals.
Prior to Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when they brought it with 3.5 alcohol in the blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," the department doctor said about this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at a dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother was neither surprised by the fact that his daughter disappeared 48 hours," the chief was surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance to drink by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of dependence itself.
"Alcoholic means a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a systematically failed social or family environment," says Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokesperson Jurinová, this year in the pediatric clinic of Motol were hospitalized until mid-November forty drunk children.
However, statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after walking medical recognition, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply meet after school and drink early, there are three seasonal heights for Pelikan: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink for bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of holidays."
"On the witch day I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at once," Pelikán adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day will not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a serum with glucose and the nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They take it much better, because after the rest of the night, they get up well and they don't hurt anything."
"Only they are confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their sense of humor at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for severe patients cost about ten thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when in the visit I tell them directly to the children how much their drinking has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer at a job for young people to earn enough to pay for that night," says Pelikán.
Medical insurance, in your opinion, may be a regression measure, which usually returns treatment expenses to people, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 planes out of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday to Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time that such a device is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad to carry out training or demonstration flights.
This is the two-way version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 singles.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, has already taken over them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the Department of Defence Press, indicates that it is not yet known when planes will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the fixed aircraft long ago, without additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The biplace L-159T1 exchanged in their current state," Právo Pejšek said.
He added that the army does not run out of bi-planes, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for a 200 million kroner for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 bi-seat devices.
One of the new planes already received by the army in July, the other will be handed over at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed itself to adding aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that EADS is the one that withdraws L-159 aircraft and will serve for pilot practices in NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské nounny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a house plane and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion kroners was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not convene an invitation to tender for purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current Defence Directorate states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so he wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes is likely to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by making a European invitation to tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Home planes and the last should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely in 14 days.
A longer index finger than the ringer indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the ringer are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
They could depend on testosterone level, male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo prostate cancer test, in particular if this feature is associated with genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as Eeles indicates.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, at the same time, with 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring.
They had the same odds of suffering prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
For men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men of less than 60 per cent the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone affects the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "showed completely".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czechia, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday covered with snow.
The roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and the quitanev machines circulated all night throughout many areas.
In the morning road D5 was closed between the 89 and 93 kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, as well as the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Automotoklubu (UAMK).
In kilometre 91 a truck crashed, in 93 two industrial vehicles were hit and injured.
Several tourists also ended up in the hive.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at mile 185 towards Prague.
They hit two trucks there.
Drivers must move slowly after Brno in the 190 km or cross Brno and enter the 182 km in Kývalce.
There have been several-kilometre jams.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, just next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
They are forming jams, for example, in Prosek, although it is also congested Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
The trams travel late, for example in the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Miru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
Problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday night until 5 p.m.
Currently, it can already be circulated on most of the roads south of Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brněnska snow languages are being formed, and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
To date, the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will be opened to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region which, as it is a protected natural zone, should simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, as indicated by ČTK.
In Czechia they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, they fell about 15 centimeters of snow.
Snowfalls gradually return to Czechia.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army is using in Afghanistan a new "smart" weapon, known for the moment only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" would make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise punch.
His bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm-calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind obstacles, walls or trenches.
No doubt, normal protection cannot be used and, when it launches its deadly rain from metal sharpens, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use an "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it its laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the weapon is loaded and the projectile is released at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs relocated
Fujitsu branch moved to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
Japanese consortium Fujitsu relocates his branch office to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer sector giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year of their former office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, a large office complex in Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad neighborhood, Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, another 100 employees from the consortium, previously spread across the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is currently very important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region yesterday brought joy to those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against it.
Frankfurt Economics Section Chief Markus Frank (CDU) said that he won a Global Player.
This is a "great recognition to the site."
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger's mayor, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The address first informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons led to the fall.
In such a way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope that the owner and tenant of the building will be shown cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial project of building the seaside town.
As a joint project of the city and a private enterprise of projects between the station and the municipality, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive construction that formerly used the holes as parking spaces and the level of buildings.
In 2001 the investment consultancy and taxing companies, the Software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu consortium, from Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest global IT provider.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries here will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the office building of Astro Park.
The old complex of the twentieth century, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, among others, houses the central association of electrotechnics and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anxiety is becoming more and more gripped by Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the revelation platform from its server.
Political pressure is possibly behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, appears to be detained in England.
Wikileaks' revelation platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet country in Europe.
The well-known American Senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to Wikileaks boycott.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's list of wanted persons, must remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the activists of revelations reported through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to publishing secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon service website in order to cope with high numbers of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we will spend our dollars hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its server through Wikileaks, after Senator Joe Lieberman's employee had requested investigations, reported the CNN chain according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The Senate council for security of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, reports the British "Guardian".
"I had hoped that Amazon would take these measures earlier, before previous information publications classified through Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and thoughtless process of Wikileaks puts at stake our national security and threatens life in the world," he said in a statement by the independent senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with their service to spread stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is sought in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's list of wanted persons.
According to an article from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently classified research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's security, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to North American statements.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the person responsible for Wikileaks' revelations must be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, a head of government counselor Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, said on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange grows a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, American President Barack Obama's spokesperson, called for "iridicle and absurd" that Assange has requested the resignation of the state secretary, in case she is responsible for ordering diplomats recently involved in spying.
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website."
The US government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of Distribution of the National Centre against Terrorism, was appointed as Special Officer, announced the White House.
Therefore Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks filtration.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that in order to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, Wikileaks should be put at risk.
"We have done all we can to get in touch with them," said the spokesman of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
Ice cream University
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream is prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice creamers has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream really come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The ice cream forms the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice cream spreads with a spatula on the ice cream of the counter, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, it is not necessary to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream college with the freezer in 2003 to ensure that ice cream on its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice creamers has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses for more days on chocolate ice cream and practice in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk in the gentle ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this California art, loves the slow food movement and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years' time in an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in his bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because his children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream teacher Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of perfect ice cream.
It is not only their good taste, but also their silky softness and their good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation nor the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why each ball has something romantic."
The first step into the process seems very easy.
Luciano makes the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powder milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large beater, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine tap and come out a pasteurized white basic cream, the base for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or with no stellizer?
How can one give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises them to abandon the trends of the time.
He who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", has perhaps used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably rubber guar, of beans guar.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, just buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite an ice cream granite sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
They use aromas.
As for the taste of ice cream, the Luciano master distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are dust and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavoured ingredients into their merchandise."
"But you must try it once."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the participants in the course can use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them develop four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better does not necessarily depend on having more aroma of toffee or more pure fruit.
There is no need for hazelnut ice cream to be known for dried fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group elaborates the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and something less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream is an articulation problem: Melocoton pure is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar ratio of the basic recipe should be lowered.
For lemon ice cream an extra portion of sugar is required.
Luciano takes out a tool with which it sets the amount of sugar of the fruit types (meditional wine grower for Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the account.
Elaborating ice cream only requires physical application, as before.
Not only does it help the tool for the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled at a temperature below zero.
Nevertheless, all automation remains out of the small folder.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his comrades from top to bottom with fruit purée, as if it were a giant miniprimary without control.
"In all the courses," says Master Luciano, "it's only a matter of time that passes something like this."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experiencing transgenic plants.
This issue is currently formulated by the group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems a conspiracy theory but we have not documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa's group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert has also been hired for years in the Ilsi association.
The consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the Efsa verification rules of genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interest, critical Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation in Ilsi and imitate the company's writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa was without support or transition time to Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that their band.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which were conducted by the General Environmental Office as well as by an EU parliamentary clairvoirant.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for the assessment of the risk to biotechnology without Lobby's responsibility.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, makes the genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If you don't look for risks, how are you going to find yourself?" he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in the US and Europe.
That is why there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has got some, in total about 400 kilograms.
On Monday he was in front of Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind him.
There were demonstrations
Snow.
The story is well known: In September the excavators arrived and began to bring down a large section of the northern wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: thousands and thousands manifested themselves against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As he was strapped, most of the wing was made rubble.
It rotates at 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He is excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the rags.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The stone trail of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in an earlier warehouse of French Navy munitions, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, trouble the gravel or send it to the garbage," he says in his office, a wooden cottage that once was a guard house.
They insulted him and threatened him, explained, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing to the wreckage company.
He spoke with the 21S enemies for several days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about the fall.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilometer-cut apple, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a reminder but also with the hope of being able to return it to a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
Stuttgart's stone of impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
Climb your whole land, take a tour of your great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
Carry your treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones attached.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
White, yellow, warm, excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
It points to a lot: Red sandish, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Good for travertine."
In the past, the masses belonged to the gallery of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the police chief of Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, toba of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple device and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something had been destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people had to do to the stone dealer, besides the quarry, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass maker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the man who is in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talent around great potential
There's an active influx in the buffet.
16 students flock around breads, tomato soup and sweets.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Vokswagen car manufacturer have invited students to a workshop of mechanical engineering and design.
In a sort of contest of ideas, you have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, like VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Their mission: To hire more talented students from universities as soon as possible before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities don't provide publications about their students' skills, they try and capture exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of project at Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins talent.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, elbows and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the illusionful young talents the curriculum and the work for students and shows them his ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students come in contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe interesting candidates more closely and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point earlier was in technical projects," says Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
Unless they have to be announced and, above all, to obtain a highly qualified workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI) in German, there were 40,000 vacancies in October.
And according to VDI forecast, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for talent hunting.
It organizes expensive recruitment events, such as KPMG career, a type of modern yincan, where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice on the exit.
Only the cream cream of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the mass."
"The simple journey itself was only a short one."
For the hunters Dykta the notes give results.
"To date we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some are near their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, there are also hunting, above all, small and medium-sized companies, classics with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students at the specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sita Stübe, in charge of personnel for Solarworld Solar Technology Manufacturer.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacancies appear on the company's website.
"It's being very complicated to fill vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld works with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that they can practice with us or carry out their thesis.
There are no advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal environment, plain hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium can't normally offer it," says Stübe, the staff officer.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important.
The key factors are flexible working hours, child assistance or good promotion possibilities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld holds 55th out of 100 top employers in Germany.
The institute prepares an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what the employee is asked how satisfied he is with work and the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of employees.
Stübe, the staff officer also expects extra points in her ranking by her aspirants to work.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly focused on the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy that earns a good reputation as employers.
It advises its customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves," he says.
In the industry is called Employer Branding internal, also promoting corporate identity within the staff.
"Completed employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get directly promotion for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby annulled its previous plans unappealably.
Also on the Atlantic coast there are new drillings closed for the moment.
This announced the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What led to this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the life of eleven workers and caused the biggest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings on the west side of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
The partisans wanted to decrease the dependence of the US on new foreign oil supplies.
To date it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of criticism is the British Energy Consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
An investigation commission commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the Minister of the Interior, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various petroleum consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe using harder controls and stricter safety regulations.
The responsible supervisory authority, which, after being charged with charges of corruption, has now fallen into disbelief, is reformed from the root.
Obama announces in parallel that the tax gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
Industry publicly announces that total Gulf extraction will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, so far.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by the BDO consulting company - before Wednesday's extraction ban.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows what changes exactly with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are soon prolonged, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilanda is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil brown, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live in theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassured the journalists: "Today will pass enough oil in front of your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys walking in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulences on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It can't be seen that on the surface they float brown oil stains.
Previously here he used to pick shrimps with fists, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: That, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most impoverished regions of the world.
On the route of the river passing through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown broth, who dives his hand into the water, will draw out a lot of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark dazzling sticks, sadly isolate the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain, bird bands are sought, as if they were in the wetland as usual: As soon as the outer barrier is closed, a sort of ghostly calm of an anterior paradise with a scent of gasolinera expands in it.
"What's happening here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
War comparison takes place.
The area of the Ogoni settlement has been a reborn battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke up more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, companies are banned from returning to Ogoniland: While they were pumping more than two million barrels of black gold daily in the entire Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters, steel platforms such as water carvings were highlighted: "Christmas Trees" affectionately called the heads of the drilling machines.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, says Akpobari, then sends a constant flow of oil into the water.
According to expert evaluations, more than two billion litres have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the wreckage of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists come to their heads about to break up and pipelines with leaks as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards usually in the world conventional ones, reprovoked scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the fault indexes of the pipes are "over a multiple more than elsewhere".
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, there is a workshop full of oil under the free sky, figures from among the mangroves arise: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drillings, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, it burns a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil heats in the fire for hours, Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drips and eventually leaves diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre diesel barrels daily: "Give us 34,000 naira", about $22.
Delta inhabitants take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of just 40 euros-cent per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers" who called the pipeline network through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this step at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military positions, keep the best part in apricots and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academic about whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or the weak way of production.
"If the oil tankers did not behave like invaders and would not have completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no thefts, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the ogoni are mainly destroyed by Shell to the point that only a deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as Chinese."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear," says muscular Ömann.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes illegal refiners, do not threaten them with arrest, but with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This doomed invention has completely torn our country," says Akpobari.
Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, A380 has a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Airbus passengers in Qantas who made an emergency landing early in November were much more fortunate than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived through their investigations a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and alert a possible factory defect.
The defect potential has complicated implications: In a hose connection, fatigue or crack cracks can be caused, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 planes in the A380 series.
Among them was Qantas-Airbus who had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a complaint at the Sydney federal court that made it possible to further legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline will seek compensation for the November incident.
The engine brand has lost parts and its wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that additional safety tests will be carried out for superhumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesperson for AtSB.
The security problem has become sufficiently important to inform all affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa repels the engine of a A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada all over the country causes traffic chaos
Germany totally white: From one day to another it has snowed in almost all the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter ice Germany: Nearly the whole country reached freezing temperatures on Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 cm thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and many streets.
In the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the discharges are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong wind bursts bar the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects living tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on highways and on national roads.
According to weather service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of fresh snow falling and cold and strong winds are responsible for retreading it.
There they were trapped during the night many trucks and cars.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, the police authorities reported major street riots.
In the A2, the snow and wind stopped traffic and created jams.
In Turingia the snows affected both A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the roads or broken chains and holes are the main problems.
The long-term service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended in Saxony.
In Saafeld, Turingia had an ICE train to stop his trip to Munich.
Firemen and rescue service served 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
The snowy winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, the winds with snow caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The discharges are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers swept at the airport, despite this there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train at a crossing in Ostholstein.
The machinist suffered mild injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to the snowy streets: also here a truck was reached at a crossing because the vehicle was trapped.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after returning with her car near Aschaffenburg on a rocky road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be smoother and more dusty and will therefore be retreaded in soft cracks.
But the wind will drop.
Only the Baltic Sea will be hit by strong and fast winds.
It will no doubt continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Diosche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution seeks buyers for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could provide up to EUR 500 million.
Deutschen Bank recently settled its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in the district of the banks of Frankfurt; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of resurgence, and seeks a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland says, based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not appoint the reasons for the sale on a project.
"We always check if property should be owned or sold and then rent them back," he said.
That is why Germany's largest credit institution is renouncing its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached some EUR 200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the renowned newspaper towers as "Greentowers" in about 500 million euros.
If new buildings are sold in a bank fund or an independent investor has not been disclosed at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands of mourning persons for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
However, bodies have not been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place in the Pike River mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between 17 and 62 years of age were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced to the place of misfortune, but no sign of survival was discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could be lowered for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts concluded that there was no possibility that miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
At present, relatives and friends remind the deceased of a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining sunlight on Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In homage to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with helmets, lamps and names of miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothing and surfboards.
The flags flung on average even in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative act.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his child until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the family members of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the island of southern New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases have been extracted, the overwhelming temperatures inside the mine will begin to descend, Gary Knowles, the police superior, said to the journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit in artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn again explores the borders of the genre with his epic battles "Wallalla Rising".
What audience would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he filmed "Wallalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and pluck his enemies the guts of their living bodies when he is in bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, does not say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters get carried away by as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoying the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the backrestors offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for growing and interested filmmakers in existentialism and in very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients, it is a pity that they cannot rule out each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and trilogy about the drug-trafficking hairstyle "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he basically refuses to make his works for all the public with something more humorous in the main current or something less of brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and guts that sprout cannot deter most artistic film followers.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and is stuck an eternity in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shut up again there.
It is a pity that "Wallalla Rising" has not found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and is only posted on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the alleged and bloody facade, a piece of film is hidden, sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for viewers.
Refn condemns just a moment of relaxation and its glacial images and the grim sound band of trance make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hate, which from the hearts of the characters goes toward him.
Only a young blonde, who loyally supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, all others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of a single eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, to change and surprise.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to take an opinion on this subject until checks are allowed.
On the average night of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli fighter F-15 I aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), dealing with a reactor that appeared to have been built by Syrians with North Korea's help in the cube, hidden in a valley coming out of the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the proximity of el-Kibar very suitable for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are constructed.
On the other hand, the technique only serves for other purposes than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the interior.
The reactor had been in operation for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later from the bombing, it is hardly more known than by that time, the puzzles grew bigger over time.
The former U.S. President, George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before the CIA attack the CIA was fully confident that the Syrians had built a reactor in El Kibar, but that he had hardly seen any indications that there was a "nuclear weapons programme in the country".
In Europe, a number of secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "assuming reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "opportunity".
They lack solid evidence, as well as IAEA.
When asked how certain it was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat replied in summer in a stoning manner that IAEA had "sufficient material to have questions."
The Syrians quickly stripped themselves of the rubble of the so-called "unused military building" and cloged the ground into consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium traces in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, IAEA obtained satellite images about a member state, from commercial sellers at the moment just after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA submitted.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always understood that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
Uranium originated from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as an unrealistic after particle analysis.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss it, just as with regard to satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited from having a second inspection in el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not been successful since June 2008 and "progressing into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons is finally pending, in which the IAEA monitors.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly made known until what teams they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they appear to be suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as an intern, again derived from the proximity of the cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or immediately next to a military base, Syria prohibits entry into the IAEA to all three places on this ground.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the United States has asked IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the teams thanks to U.S. Secret Service warnings.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three places and the cube on the shores of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna said that at least one of the teams can be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "no sign of sensitive activities" or enrichment of uranium or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium must come from and where plutonium must subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is no doubt either that the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargo from the ground trucks disappeared, no one has information on where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers it unlikely that the al-Tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometres from el-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its capacity as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous IAEA inspector, related it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected locations and removed large containers after IAEA requested entry.
It may be chance but it hardly contributes to dissipating suspicion.
In addition, it is said in the diplomatic sector that IAEA has spent a few months developing an inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, raises the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Venezuelan nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future," but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: For this, most of the IAEA governing council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for a climb.
On the other hand, as one diplomat thought: "What if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the address of her debut still nameless.
She herself wrote the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
You don't know much more about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosniak women's associations have protested rapidly, so at the last moment they moved some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She's not diplomatic, women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie's position in this regard is enough for the victims on the script.
His organization in accordance with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture that read the script, gave behind a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie wasn't at all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she puts herself with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and to give voice to all the parties involved.
Its contents remain imprecise.
The network circulates a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian field in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the "victim of rape falls in love with torture."
It is certain that Jolie's film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "just and based on wrong information."
Today they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far away from here
This afternoon it is again good for the Irish.
No trace of distress
On the other hand, the household team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout joy as they rumble the loud music, beat the floor with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in the South American Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to beer vessels from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quaint drinking game and the discreet computer actually don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with that, to distract himself from the fulminating question, what the future will be.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will hold a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's far away from home and I still don't have work there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from one shot he got the job of his dreams as event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already been looking for luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, his brother Colin currently works as IT advisor in Londrés.
Young people go: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predict economic experts and the ESRI Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015 there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The predictions are confirmed, a migration wave comparable to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis is mainly confusing to well-trained Irish youth, for those who so far are costing everything.
Loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young migrants, who complain that "in Ireland everything sinks."
"There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, will go and lose our country and with it to a whole generation."
"The last one that closes the door."
Leanne Caulfield, law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a bleak future coming because the government is only engaged in assembly and no longer offers future prospects for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Notice how their peers go from unremunerated practices to the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career," says the manager.
On your website you will find photos of a guy practicing surfing in Australia and another guy practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, but with freedom and fun.
For half a year now, Sean O'Donovan knows what it's like to build something else.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish partners in construction in Germany.
Now they raise a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime so he can pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as it was long ago when he first walked the threshold of his house.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs at something embarrassed and goes through frozen rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with garden care in front of the houses, at the entrance are parkingd big and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house along with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a credit.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid of failing credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
Civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not as dramatic as in the past here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's already worked in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend in New Zealand get along?
But in these days there is one thing that worries you about supermania: the celebration of your 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid he can degenerate at a farewell party.
"Only, not too much emotion," he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Good-bye, it sounds very distressing."
"Better we call it a march party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private enterprises.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the last Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related issues were highlighted in the results of this year's survey in September and early October.
The first is the relatively animated mood reigning in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the South American Pacific coast (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
Around 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but significantly higher than 25 per cent in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but significantly higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis is likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty is only marginally increasing in 2009 and has been reduced again this year to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the start of the surveys, most polled in Latin America mention crime, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see figure 5).
About 31 per cent said that they or close relatives had been victims of crime in the last year, a figure that had been reduced since 38 per cent last year and that had been the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will enable their country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (up from 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, same as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent versus 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds this title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Waste Elections
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went far worse than foreigners feared trying to help the country go back to their problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, paperwork thrown in the cantanillas, destroyed electoral colleges and acts of intimidation.
Election schools opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, reported fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, said it was "a relatively good election in many ways."
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have cautioned that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they are, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and with his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
Displacement is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, an old first lady, have withdrawn their initial request requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if he has any, has gone to the second round.
In view of the fact that the epidemic of cholera is raging in the country and more than one million earthquake survivors are still living in stores, a large abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, required to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the choice of a popular and legitimate government to be an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has been shown, Haitians themselves think so too.
Moving forward from stitches to center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the President of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity by 20 points, to more than 50 per cent, the highest level she has registered since her election in 2007.
In spite of all this, which can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the custom of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income on its discretion.
In theory, Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions where one member punched another in the face and other deputies accused the bribery government, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply next year, which will provide the President with an even greater margin of action when it is spent.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1 per cent, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, place it around 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was at the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction their priorities rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector, and made the INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now change these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, their staff members claim that they want to limit wage increases in the year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial links with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a pre-debt restructuring that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped into the Paris Club, which accounts for some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as usual.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which appears to be the prelude to the cleaning of INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term of office is over, bearing in mind that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, the support of the middle class will need to be won, much of which has become tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether to repudiate or not, calmly, many of your husband's policies.
Half-Hour by China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan say about her big brother across the street?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of eligible voters, came on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a advocate of feelings across the continent, forging innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but for a while.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) finally won three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to win most of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has tended to be completely independent of Taiwan, had almost 50 per cent of all votes against 45 per cent of the KMT.
If they were the presidents, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of votes in his party has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD paired with the KMT in the municipalities.
The elections saw the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with flags and light girls dancing clothes.
Nor did he miss the mysterious attempt to murder rigor.
Sean Lien, Lien Chan's son, honorary KMT president, was campaigning for one of KMT's candidates the night before the election.
A man of the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Curiously, it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PPD leader, shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean on the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that this was not the matter of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging feelings against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma said it had been confirmed that his policy with regard to China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to get Taiwan to return to the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but first of all that is the case.
The best thing is to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to pass.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
The President from 2000 to 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is working to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced the plans to set up an expert group that acts as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry about the change.
In a statement issued from her cell, she stated that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to appear to the presidents.
Even without Mr Chen's interference, the PPD will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
The KMT should also conduct a conscientious examination.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT's candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson claims he will restructure his office, as well as local equipment.
The large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese feel that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist revelation.
He acts at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bass player and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to act in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, one of the Grammys surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Taking into account that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since its 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but it respects the Grammys rules that it must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording what "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", no doubt had a great advance and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great ability with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, can at least set a distinction between Spalding and the path to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have recently concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophone James Moody with "Moody 4B" and key person John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite star in New Orleans and usual guest in "Treme", HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, which for the rest is tilted considerably towards fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy's wild punk James Argue's Secret Society got a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the great camera jazz of Billy Children Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with its octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bass player's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in best direction of classic albums
The nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also nominated by his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra albums, opera, coral and solo.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The names for the classical music album are Bruckner for the Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "God Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers nominated a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No 4, Daugherty for "God Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Accommodatingly Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, approximately 30 minutes, is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concert" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for her to play in Mandolin Avi Avivital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"The composition with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, was appointed in the category of orchestra function, by directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.
The appointed instrumental soloists include the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque proposed in Temecula obtains approval of the commission of order
The Temecula Mosque project has obtained unanimous support from the local commission after more than five hours of public testimonies, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying it promotes terrorism and blockades.
However, the members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bahais, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud."
"Shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loudly."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was dedicated to people interceding in favour or against the centre, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper website.
"United States no longer exists", it reads in one of the comments.
"It's another Planet of Apes with Mrs. Libertad dead in the arena."
"America has fallen."
The construction plans of Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 took place.
In the Temecula Valley, the imam Mahmoud Harmush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a water filter manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal to the municipal council.
An arsenic-resistant microbial raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients broadens the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it a very peculiar thing, although it lacks little to be a really 'alienogenic' form of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of the publication Science.
For a long time, there have been six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder how much more is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
As Anbar pointed out, finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of alien life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "if it shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider essential for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the replacement of one element by another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who conducted the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so it speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one another.
"Arsenic is mainly toxic because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, it may be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, the arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work as well as the phosphorus, so it comes in and somehow calls the biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
Researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing arsenic concentrations, which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbial grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that it can naturally exist a form of life that uses arsenic, whether in other parts of the Earth or on another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example had never been found that proved to work.
The arsenic was more common in early Earth eras, he pointed out, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not only the way life was formed on Earth in the past," Foster said, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and National Health Institutes.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton
The two missing dogs were found in front of the four stolen Bellflower motel, according to the sheriff's officers in Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Galese Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, as the authorities pointed out.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two found themselves on Wednesday, late at night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson from the Los Angeles County sheriff's department.
"The good news is that dogs are doing well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They've returned with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of discovery.
"There's an investigation going on."
"We don't mean anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make some comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek wanted to show in the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the national AKC/Eukauba championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were going to show them in other competitions scheduled for the days before the AKC/Eukauba championship, as Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the virtually two-month tour of the couple participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked-in at the motel.
Usually they stay in motels and park the van right in front of your room window.
They took three other dogs (a boxer's calf, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a very thick fur and they would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM achieves the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally obtained green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to eliminate approximately $5 billion in debt, along the way for the 86-year entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of films and television programs.
The Thursday ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relaunch under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be financed in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management needed to order its finances while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in the recovery of bankrupt companies, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial tribulations of MGM and to satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study required much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009, the parties agreed to put the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and no one was willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
Prior to the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-millionaire bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who have been collecting $375,000 per month for their company's administration services, will receive $4 million "successful fees".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which released only one film this year, and brought together an annual slate of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to make a separate loan of $265 to $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of your gift budget
While iPad is the leading candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant honey in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five 99-dollar BMX bicycles each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jumpstrings decorated with accounts, or approximately 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for balanced gifts.
I recently visited three domestic toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most well-known ones, Webkins and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys driven by button batteries are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and over) are toys of the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when their belly is pressed.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze begins to set up a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start tightening, you can't stop.
For song combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking over the Elmo Live technology of last year, the 14-inch animatronic wrist plays shift games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with locking device.
Children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you can remember Alphae, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and over), with a backpack full of questions cards designed to convert a car ride into a session with an existing self-correction exercise notebook.
If you are afraid to give your child your smart phone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
MobiGo VTech ($60, from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years old), it is the first important point of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, from 3 to 7 years) uses an iTunes type system to present electronic games and books, and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks hardly larger than a box of eyebrows, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to save words by placing the blocks in line before time runs out; it is formidable for an improvised word-armed competition.
They are increasingly toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on its presence in toys, the two largest are Webkins and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, from 6 to 12 years old) which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the online code, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include wheelchair skates or a Puffle pet toy.
A little bigger than your toothbrush pig, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last in a microrobot line powered by button stacks.
The fake insect moves quickly on 12 silicone legs that vibrate, in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of order maintenance in China is promoted
As an urban sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a square in the city, strictly inspecting the nervous people in charge of him, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the corrupt police of the urban order of China, feared and despised by their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Sign up!"
"Look out!"
Show them, she whispered, "How beautiful girls are!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with white gloves and identical green olive jackets and adjusted pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they look normal," said Mr. Tang, disrespectfully.
Models are beautiful.
More than one government has tried to clean the image of the urban inspectors of China.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grey green color from the uniforms to a supposed to be more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force by intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a basket of snacks, and observed it with the regularly rusted belt for half an hour, until the traveling seller collected his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically elected by its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police cough a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's low respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city orders, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province beat a transecutor after using his cell phone to film them while disbanding a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it described how to effectively strike offenders without causing them to bleed.
This year, a Shanghai Sandy Road vendor suffered brain damage after a row with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chenguan has left a scar on the government," complained China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a truly meticulous cleaning."
Skeptics say that the current approach is far from that.
After the district asked for eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real duties or were simply a distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's notice called for female candidates from 18 to 22 years old, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Staff said that work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a nearly governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
The female chegguans are like florists, he said, and he added, "Besides being florists, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to support this description.
But he observed that height demands were standard in many Chinese labor notices for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement of harmonious facial features.
If this means betting, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely the disabled or disfigured should not appear.
"We can't allow a person to take or a jorobad to come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colorful cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His workmate with hooligans, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
Neither do they oppose their work at a given time, they said, because they harbor bigger career ambitions than simply run away from sellers in the streets where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen street vendors who start on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu pans or tazones as possible before they are released.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman ran off on foot, temporarily abandoning his car pulled by bicycle with noodles.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who is studying marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' merchandise.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, were mutiny after the false rumor that some Chengga officials had killed a seller.
Over a dozen police or police officers were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were thrown into or caught.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm is barely guaranteed.
Only two streets from the quiet Baoguang Square, where women officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The motorcycle owner screamed loudly.
The situation stagnated for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened up their elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 years of age or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total naturality.
"Most of the time is the public that starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that prosecutors of the Department of Justice have blamed Senator John Ensign on the criminal charges arising out of his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to ensure work through lobbying for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Republican of Nevada who was considered possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national holders last year and had damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he felt "certainly happy" for the decision, which came after an entire year's investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign's lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "reported us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to raise charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have faked to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that first appeared in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, on the Senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law of lobbying for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were intimate friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolting door status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges for misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the following day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against its client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted according to the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable entering into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, which claims that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it didn't have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing but a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the Senator, who obtained work through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's head of office, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "mashing" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allied Air, and called the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When first came the news of last year's affair, Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists that he planned to apply for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude his investigation.
" Senator Ensign wants to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There was half a dozen of them "driving" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minutes per minute, they sent reports of the amazing testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were over 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the process largely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the death penalty judge voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have written in court outlining the arguments of appeals that will probably occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such a generalized and immediate saturation with inspiring details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appeals judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology required new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ulmann, chief defense counsel for Mr. Hayes.
Trial Judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, rejected the demands in a judgment last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been led by passion.
But it will probably not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeal courts have recognized that coverage of famous cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a 1966 historical ruling, the United States Supreme Court revoked the sentence of an osteopath from Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" because of the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the TV program and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of new media" in high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford's Law School, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report stating that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials more fair.
Twitter is just one of many of the issues outlined by Hayes' lawyers, who will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes might have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them shocking photographs of the crime scene during the jury's selection.
Some jurors said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.
The defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a jury who had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But its arguments on the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media were constantly burning firewood from emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state."
Your attention to Tweeter's coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly, was a ludicrous vision that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the appeals courts were often attracted by the arguments about the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which revoked Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would require new means to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can civics hold a bridge to join divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, this week a little civilism has been unleashed in Washington.
Is it an omen of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not make any progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what they all say, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to rule, rather than being another empty episode to win partisan points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the President's deficit commission was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months has generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is just enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a period of testing, investigating each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the voter's patience for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why Tuesday ' s meeting and subsequent evaluations of it by participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too great and deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is tax, expenditure, health care or social assistance, the two sides are located in opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened humor in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to how to say things," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections awaken biases, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
In some matters, in particular those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions are due at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to extend unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying the unemployment benefit for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, together with the ratification of the new START Nuclear Disarmament Pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation in the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement begins.
"After the things that must be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will turn the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a trial for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the establishment of the new Republican majority in the House and the members of the Tea Party, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as the Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they should try to fulfill their promises to cut state expenses and cancel the new health law.
These lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the reduction of expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult work in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The highest resistance is among the elected officers in the panel, suggesting that there are at least few bases or wish for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will take place next year in the form of partisan shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama's budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks he's probably losing will change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partyism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congress Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points on issues that still divide them.
A filtered American document depicts Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves a part of the bribes and protection money that directly collects the Kremlin, as reported by the US Embassy in Russia in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service were reported to operate huge blackmail systems, which helped explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stratum of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority", takes its part as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and it blames him for most corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied the charges of corruption over the years, and he has won several claims for libel on such charges.
In September, when on a Russian TV channel he was asked about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said: "It's crazy, a little girl, a little annoying."
According to polls, the Russians believe in an overwhelming way that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy's report, and it is surprising that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do so.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government works more like a cleptocracy than a government," the note says.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia which literally means "top" or protection) that passes the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"The analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, said the report, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that the best thing is to get protection from MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed on one pretext or another.
Medvedev has talked several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has achieved little progress.
The embassy's note reports on men taking bags, probably full of cash, within the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no political class anymore in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked at 154 (countries are ranked at least at the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur late at night at Moscow's time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and despite the fact that Luzhkov may be guilty of Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that the problem is being solved.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that claimed that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, let's not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way."
Veterans of the Red Jemeres forced to face the past
In a concrete, dimly lit classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Jemeres.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the administration of the Red Jemeres, the commander remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Red Jemeres in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers still live in the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemeres surrendered to the government, loyalty sustained for a long time is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Jemeres to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodia Joint Court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemeres, condemning the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Jemeres of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemeres was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the government of the Red Jemeres of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork, approximately 1.7 million people.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the government led by Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and their military fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that was made in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemers began deserting the government, culminating in the returns of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Red Jemeres fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Red Jemer elite officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, foot soldiers remained poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gained little benefit after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept to do business."
55-year-old Sr Lim, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemeres was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone food."
"But now life is difficult because we have to self-sufficient ourselves."
The current Red Jemers court has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemeres.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those of greater responsibility for crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Jemeres in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had supervised the construction of Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent booming afternoon, Im Chaem once again worked in the fields at his house on wooden balls on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She claimed that if the court called her, she wouldn't show up.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted Red Jemers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court pursued more suspects, although experts and historians questioned him.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to rejoin broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first book approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Red Jemeres.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Red Jemeres, despite the link between the city and the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But their parents reacted skeptically when they took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the text book and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people who will prosecute the court."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemeres retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with plastic bags waste leads to a rectangle of the black hollin covered by a leafy oxidized roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a bunch of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, a cell vendor at the edge of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas hoping to have good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its qualified uranium reserve for arms
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to renounce its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point without returning last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were conducted classified with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of qualified uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to one official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the topic.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I really felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have retained highly enriched uranium (hundred kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for armament) and low-enrichment uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to manufacture dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials stated that the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Staff said he was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to staff, the second operation ended on Monday and was done on a plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the task, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of low enrichment uranium investigations, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an officer of the Department of Energy working on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for arms, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation to 2012, according to the joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential for distancing.
It was stated that "while it welcomes progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not make any repairs to CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda headed to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, as the US ambassador in Madrid said on a telegram.
This is reflected by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the Government, Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish executive be informed to "be able to prove that they exercise appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing it of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "prevented pillage," says Aguirre on a cable.
The then Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence".
On the other hand, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to seek the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any criminal elements or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed its concern at the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the disclassified information of the NIC or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," says Aguirre.
In March 2007 at a luncheon between the US Ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although Spanish judges are jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the action of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its overall pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government," he says.

When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to test the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But by the content of the communications, it is seen that his romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very weird and musketed, because I came to work."
"When I told him, he was fine, but of course, now he realizes what it is to be with the child all day and not to be free to do what he wants."
Then, he talks about a message to the phone that he just received: "I want you to come back this month or you give me an address to send you to the child."
She complains: "If you don't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll pick it up when I get back," she says.
In May, he talks about his return to his people: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm only going to be there until 19, because 20 I have to introduce myself to a job not to lose it."
Make clear that if everything goes well with him, he takes his firstborn.
"He'll be with whom he owes, i.e. with me, and never in life will ever happen to leave him with anyone other than my mother," doubtful intent given his bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on 1 that month, is supposed to be killed on 10th, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
It's about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (the child) to some summer classes, and so I save some money from the kangaroo."
17, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"He says that Alberto sent you, I don't know what videos to the email, look at how when he wants to find me, he has to fuck off."
On 30th, another: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money."
On the Internet there are your messages in blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the universe MySpace, now intervening, where he was called "Muki the ex-prisoner."
"Terror in the cock (heading) ".
The last man who lived with her, the jury guard, declares her grief for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe everything happened because he didn't tell him he was a single mother.
Monica entered Palma's provincial penitentiary yesterday, from the judicial detention centre in Menorca.
Mr. Carlos Maceda explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "not having intended to cause any harm to the minor."
Earlier, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested psychiatric evidence.
People would win 4 seats in Congress and the PCC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and Members experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the general view that, whether it has advanced or not, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes it receives in these elections usually doubles what it receives in Catalans.
Thus, the Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in general in 2008, while in the 2006 autonomics, the figure was 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
To maintain this upward trend, which has been fuelled by a shift in the votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 Members in Congress, while CIU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 Members (has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - now has three - while ICV would stay with one MP or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal councils, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in its relief to the head of the Barcelona Deputy, one of the most budgeted administrations managed - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree that the PSC may lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can lead the return to the Tarraconian capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
People have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistani and Nigerians detained by agents of the General Police Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups in Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author of the last bombings in Bombay that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Kampai operation" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus has been "weak" internationally and therefore its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrate the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The present-day cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, hence that research has participated, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that similar blows are taking place in EU territory in the coming days on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were arrested in Thailand, another took place with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones that led the cell settled in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stolen passport tourists who met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Frente".
That is, the documents should be on behalf of boys between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In the media of the investigation it is stressed that, at present, no data has been found linking the arrested in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the recipient groups of the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "inverted" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by members of the "command" that ended with the life of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
PP requires Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had an opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur But his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and irrespective of philo-Soberanist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting of Arthur Mas with the assurance that he had obtained 18 Members in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make himself wanted, because the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but for the time being, the talks that these days hold but with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereign and independent discourses will have to be distributed", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to undermining the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and eliminating the tax on inheritances and donations.
Details of the Mas investment negotiation will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICRC) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric states that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of downtown Olot don't rule out that their captor would kill more than 11 elders
The managers of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmaé, the nurse who while employed there killed at least eleven elders in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by counsel from the centre, counsel Joan Canada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the responsible person" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And it is that in addition to the social contempt that the entity may suffer for failing to detect in time the criminal activities of the concealer, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation already being calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' families.
Joan Vila Dilma has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and since then has not stopped killing.
The judge had already pointed to the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old geriatric patients - that suspected that in many cases no doctor was personally exploring the deceased but that, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was being sent by telephone.
Through her director, Caritat strongly denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what has happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is no single indication that there has been an unwise action on the part of anyone other than the accused himself."
He was already baptized as "Angel de la Muerte" and confessed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 for a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case, he died with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed by helping with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that central staff have access to medicines.
Insulin bites and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her quest to alleviate the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that must clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, hugged them inside by giving them ugly as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the protests of the concealer, nor even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the slightest sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after he has committed, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say they are available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB Threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that warned "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
Peripheral differentials have been tightly closed and European banks' actions have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to be wrong, and the euro has hardly answered what is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is owned by an liquid market which, as it collapses, is recovered but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will delay in losing fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and tomorrow will have to be withdrawn for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded that the public debt purchase plan be finalised ineffectively and that all extraordinary liquidity measures be eliminated in the long term and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" will be extended and will maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond buying program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will revert the excellent reaction of markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with removing liquidity measures, God will assist us!
Just as at their May meeting when they stated that they had not even considered buying bonds and collapsed markets, tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazouca on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a further collapse of the market.
Yesterday the letter auction to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the rates in Portugal dropped 30 basic points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change of market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, figures from the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech in order to relax the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to prove that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen to 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchange.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been rapid and powerful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain asking for a Help Plan would be self-implantation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available the triple that in March, to expensive rates and closes access to sine-die markets.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's woman, "in addition to being, as it may be."
Cheer up, we can.
President Eulen will challenge Vega Sicilia's board asked for by his children
The time does not soften the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge it by considering it "full right" the El Enebro judicial board of the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take place with the management bodies of the signature holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute for control by the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the governance bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was defeated by five of his seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year and whose appeal is recorded in the Mercantile Register.
El Enebro's judicial board for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the coffin of the troenos in the family Álvarez.
The use of the judge to set the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism guaranteeing the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described as a "desperate resource of the applicants their five children to, through procedural arguance, in clear fraud of law and abuse of law, try to validate and sanitize the radically null assembly of 18 January", according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the Board, once the board is held, to challenge it by considering it to be “full right”.
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the judge to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven children control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, the profit over 51 per cent of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the substantive issue that must be decided upon by the judge once the examination of the demand for appeal is held, for which there is not yet a specific date.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software designs real-time improvements in cars.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this selected universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived squadronship and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final line of the championship all waged for the victory of the Ferrari del Fernando Alonso.
Without undermining the ability as a driver of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propells his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn him into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for far away from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design manufacturing factory assembly chains around the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The aim is to faithfully reproduce, simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable failures and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or the most famous utilitarian cars in Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to design and effect "in a few hours, almost real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that the squadrons in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-quality professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of modifications in the balls.
Siemens' management explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull balls except for the engine, which is Renault's entire responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can lead from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems through lasers and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most on each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has mounted the high-tech factory to design and produce its balls in a town about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including their two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose contest is invaluable and their notoriety are hidden.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R & D advances in cart cars contributed 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology amounts to 85% of the success, while drivers contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive shop in collaboration are its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain’s vice president Helena Herrero set as an example the renovated shop located in the Barcelona Gran Via, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been working for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand selling points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being Barcelona's third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trading network aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in buying, caring, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-wide pioneer pilot program that manages to solve the possible problems of HP computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bet on stealing a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell's CEO Jaime Guardiola believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but initially discards a new liquidity crisis and foretells the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it provides for a breakdown of the margins of interest, which will attempt to compensate in part with increases in commissions and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, his pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years so that he can survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new master plan that will have a three-year duration.
The aim, in addition to surviving without the need to make use of FROB's public aid, is to gain market share with the capture of one million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted - its large pending subject, since so far it has added more to SMEs and businesses than to the retail customer.
This year has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the plan 2011-2013 is the productivity bet, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduced costs as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year's master plan Optima, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made it to expand it one more exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardianola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And although he believes that the passive war - which penalises margins - is decreasing, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and boxes for their emissions for liquidity is already being transferred to the credit price to compensate for the margin drop.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already issued orders on Thursday to his network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see FiveDays on 22 and 27 November-.
He also recognized that the bank's trend now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "greater sizes will be required."
"Next year is going to move everything," he said.
It asserts that capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial entity enters red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can supplement the market in raising funds to new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it remained important to what some Vatican bankers already consider as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC excludes a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday, ruled out that there would be a wave of mergers of savings boxes and insisted again on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being implemented.
When it started the concentration process of the Spanish savings boxes, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Cases (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday, ruled out that this new wave of operations would occur.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Bank group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
"The majority is completely done; it may be that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and protected by the Banco de España, which has collaborated very much too," said the manager.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is being carried out "at the earliest possible speed, and we must be very satisfied with how it is taking place within the time frame that in its day, not now, was marked in the business plans with the Banco de España", he emphasized.
"To move from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel," he noted.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "is going as fast as possible".
It also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without benefit, up to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of airports in Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in triggering the current crisis.
How do we interpret those movements?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is shocking to maintain the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany begins to speculate about the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, composed of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the South would abandon the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of the framework, although it now looks like science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the proposals of the Germans with greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments from any of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government took a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (tax rigor plans and stability in public finances), and what their European partners were doing, including France.
The second on the front gave it to the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the public were very opposed to Greece's rescue.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union treaties, to make possible the saving of a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should be attending the Union reform process which will enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although we now have to take action with which we may not agree very much, from that date on the old operation of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the violator countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as that which has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, is simply not going to tolerate it.
The guest is clear.
And we'd have a hard time not understanding it.
This is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead to greater peace of mind.
And that we take advantage of the window of opportunity that they have given us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite criticisms to Merkel, the the thesis of ordering is opened.
But the red line that Germany has traced there is, and it doesn't look like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, that of leaving a monetary zone overcrowded from less serious countries, cannot be excluded.
So Germany can always tell us that it has already warned us.
Sport and law fraud
Traits such as those of Alonso and Ramos before Ajax show ingenuity but not will to escape a penalty.
The alleged expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party played on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has led to the writing of ink rivers about whether or not such behaviour is anti-sports and if, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As it is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time to make mistakes to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction of the next party of the liguilla, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the team coach José Mourinho with two parties and the players involved with various economic amounts.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case reported is due to the fact that it has been played by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts nobility and honor, and that it has sometimes fined its players by similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently by Mourinho, who adds an episode more to his dilated history of his hisstrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour which is not expressly prohibited by the rules of procedure contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are committed by law fraud; they are indeed actions that are respectful of the sport rules, but seem to circumvent their meaning.
The issue goes through examining the type of damage that causes the sports spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, which with these actions was not put in danger, i.e., there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is alluded to by the clean game is to prevent the team of the players from taking unfair advantage of the opposite team, which did not happen either.
However, the paradox of the action of Real Madrid's players is that they did not accommodate what we normally characterized as a trap or a fraud of law, because their violation of the rules was not hidden in order to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely their action sought to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders gain from the intentional errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that it does not put the rival in a disadvantaged position or benefit in the same party, since the result of the action obviously means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it's also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club won't be able to count on these players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that may threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the equipment can be eliminated at first exchange, and with this action players perform a sanction party and pass to the second round of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sports spirit, from which it is part to make strategic decisions that favour making the most of what the rules allow.
In the present case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing the punishment or running away from it.
Although the boundary between ingenuity and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises by two factors: because it was two self-exjections and the way in which the transmission of the directive was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture group Christmas dinners in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for 16 and 17.
They proliferate the self-suffering celebrations of employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tower and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the pre-Christmas group dinners, which continue to exercise oxygen balloons for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations of the interviewed sector coincide.
To finish complicating accounting, this year's calendar (at the fall of Nochevieja on Friday) has concentrated petitions on the week of 13 December, with the result to the date of an avalanche of dinner reserves for peak days (16 and 17) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the stage of weak cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners on budget matters.
To avoid tradition, many workers keep it paying for their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both require battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauró in Barcelona, Gaietà Farrès.
The employer's representative, today, does not dare to predict what this month's celebrations will be like.
"People think about it long before they book."
"He wants to get out but has the alerts on the subject of prices," he points out.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to fall a step down with the crisis, so that the fringe around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A survey in various central establishments shows the collapse of petitions for the night of 17.
In the Soteros group they indicate that there is a genuine demand boom for Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to what they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulae of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the peculiarity of the calendar has taken more early reservations, even since early November.
"We have done our best to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they say.
In AN Group, which banners El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 premises, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in billing from the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who precede parties.
To its six group menus have added a Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for requiring more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that invite their employees again and feel that the volume of the groups is much larger.
By employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars Association, Restaurants and Leisure), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and claims that all the reservations are "lived", although the customers "negotiate at most".
Yes, the illusion for parties has not come down, pay whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program causes great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Apart from the clarifications and juicy details that they offer on the content of the talks and the thoughts of American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between both countries in the field of atomic security, rather than going up, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - which weapons are not assembled but are stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for developing in Washington.
This is what Ambassador Anne W. Patterson of Pakistan listed in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and reason to keep watch.
"Pakistan has had to recruit staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a meeting with his American counterparts.
The latest documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the growing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan's high pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which calls "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, maintains: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "Despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups".
In the hunt of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high responsibility for counter-terrorism to prevent new filtrations.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track movements and locate Assange wherever it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow Assange's movements".
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Furthermore, it is not new, but it dates from 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents, but with the charges of sexual abuse faced by Australians in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator's lawyer, Mark Stephens, says that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after being authorized by the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called free-way notice network to proceed with an arrest -- which must be carried out by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, has been willing to respond by videoconference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange applied and obtained permission to leave Sweden of the prosecutor's case, which they compare with the mythical Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," she said.
While the world seeks him - and his mother from Australia defends his son's innocence-- Assange remains in unknown whereabouts, but not silent.
On Monday, an interview was given from an indeterminate location to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation calling for the resignation of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that you were responsible for ordering US diplomats spying on the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, you should resign," he said.
His opinion was confirmed yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridicula and absurda".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," CNN said.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking counter-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to minimize Assange's importance contrasts with views that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, has asked the Department of State to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue any contribution or aid to them".
Far further has Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retreat after saying that Assange should "be killed".
"Obama should turn it into an objective and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Whoever in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and whatever non-execution would be too kind a punishment," said Fox.
Puigcerós seeks peace in ERC with kinsmen's tails to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the last internal revolt in the ERC ranks, without north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party's president is aware that his resignation concealer is insufficient for his cousins to the former Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that he can at all cause the head cracks that he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Left will try to win the new critics with pipes that allow him to get armored up to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers can speak about their continuity in secret.
By means of paper, and not by hand.
If the cardinals want to vehicular a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered ratified by half one more vote, but he added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be a good result "to Bulgaria".
The next to Carod demand something more than making the president available for militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercos controls the highest organ between congresses.
But by not having the majority sufficient to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map from here to May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the elaboration of the strategic reorientation document that the management will vote on the National Council on 18th.
His intention is to evaluate Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to advance the congress in the fall of 2011, something the dome already gives.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that the "polyphony" undermines stability and that its objective is to make the organization, once and for all, capable of washing the dirty rags from doors inside.
In this line, the article that the acting advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovation gave the fact that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e. to include new faces coming from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid at once assembleism as a mechanism of operation.
He therefore called for a reform of the statutes to allow congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, who has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 convulsive conclave left the leadership of reviewing assemblism at a specific convention for the reform of statutes.
This date is still pending, since the internal tide of recent years was not conducive to dealing with the matter.
Now, without sectors critical to blindness, it can be a good time to resume and try to close it forever.

According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in Mexico State, four less than the previous month according to the contents of MILENIO State of Mexico.

It maintains China’s objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that he supported his offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he stated that over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community on this issue.
He noted that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas progress has been made, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Act, which sets out the objectives for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities to achieve energy savings targets, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments from other countries, are under way or have already been concluded.
For example, it referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for the exchange of incandescent spotlights by savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific advisor to the government of that country in the field of climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than they are generally thought to be.
For example, it stated that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and plans to do so both by 2020, has increased.
Pasted the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP national leader stated that the former bread leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what his right is.
The national leader of the NAP, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was subject to legality and that the former Pakistani leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what his right is.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal, if any, to the National Council Order Commission, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that there has never been an alliance at the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action will be strengthened by the internal election of the next 4 and 5 December, in which he will be elected to his successor.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal," he said.
The bread manager explained that the NAP supports 71 years of dialogue, so "it does not scare us the internal competition; the counter "we enjoy it and strengthen us," he said.
He said that the council will undoubtedly be able to choose the best or the best leader to require National Action for the next three years, hence it will deliver the scam "to whom the council determines."
"I have this absolute calm and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the reputation that the party recorded in the past elections of 4 July will be reflected in the next fights, although "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be reason for observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will meet expectations."
When questioned about PRI criticisms to President Felipe Calderon for his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called on the prisoners to reflect on the sexians of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the Zedillo and Salina governments were better than those of Fox and Calderon; let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet," he said.
He felt that the federal executive holder could make expressions like those he did in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there was no bite or much less censorship in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter Law for Undocumented Students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act law is the right thing, call on your senators and urge them to pass it is legislation," American president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act law is the right thing, call your senators and urge them to pass it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message maintains a cyberlink with a broader document that calls on the public to communicate immediately with the senators, as the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time for your voice to be heard," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of the Bush era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
This blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade to Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue has been resolved, a schedule can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to settle the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement at some point at that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The Senate leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote of debate" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the law of American Dream would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, when organizations that support the project play an intense role in ensuring the approval of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
For this reason, the Dream Act supporters need to add several Republicans if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most wooed Republicans are the Senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but have declared that they will not back it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position right now.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the lake
The second round of Language Delights was a walk where participants made the narration showcase
"That of Sex in the Language I understand it but... the finger in the lake? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of Language Pleasures, cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of his question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to The Sex in the Language, explained).
The finger on the lake... "put us in a rush", gently stared the Argentine writer to the public, mostly young people, who was quoted at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "alla" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom he does not get answers although clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist, she's convinced, "patience isn't my strength, maybe it's my laga."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hall, but who explains that laga is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the laga is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the laga only got to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very insightful.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative entitled "Elogio de la invention", where the finger in the lake is not named but is discovered at a time.
With brushes of magical realism, he had a famous spell, which he played clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that he had lost a maid, a story that he came to speak later America, the great novel that his own chroniclers did not miss from the beginning and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what was told by the conqueror captains.
"Cervants who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination to which he was missing until the smell."
However, he highlighted "the madmen and the better-imagined liars" and is where reality and lies converge, where one no longer knows that the story belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
It's actually called the "cervantinal tradition."
"By your inheritance we are what you count."
In turn, writer Mayra Montero shook and applauded the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger in the lake.
Cuban-Purriquena pointed her towards the great lake of social violence that crosses her country - and shares Latin America - the product of drug trafficking and sale disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between author and reader, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the lake of the writer's commitment".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciousness that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every assertion there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be owners of our thinking and to be owners of reality we have to dye: and to nuance often means to put your finger on the lague and disturb those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuisance and also to disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting people to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had high careers, but has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, there are also two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, he has had high careers, but he has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting the medal of the sub champion, a step has been left behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist came to its first end as a coach at the 2002 Opening Tournament when he carried the reins of Morelia with which he fell overall of 4-2 to Toluca; later, in the Closure 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a global of 3-1 and was precisely to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament again before the Devils, Rubén again suffered a reversal, as his team finished pairing 2-2 against the choricers after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty sign it was put in advantage of 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players of his failed from the 11 steps and suffered turning 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the evil and can celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an amateur to which I owe myself and as a result will come the title for me, but the above is the most important," said the Timonel when he questioned him about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very in force has the previous end, of which, he said, he has learned much, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalty shots we were already ready to go out running and I think that that is a teaching, until the party is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that doesn't bother you, because it trusts its players: "One never seeks to get to the penalty sign, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no other one and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad game the fate, sometimes by the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but we left, that left us something for this end that we hope will not get to that instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-champion technician and to test for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules for visas
People must attend Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
As from 10 January 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the United States Embassy and consulates will be changed.
Under the new procedure, most applicants are required to attend Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASCs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff shall take the biometric information of the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer required to make a payment to conclude the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest AUC where they will present their documents and take their marks.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the AUC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for visas in the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra fee of $26.

Announcing NASA Extraterrestrial Life Find
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will make known tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there exists extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference on Thursday at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one to study the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
By quoting the press, NASA has assured that it will present "a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life," which has led to speculation from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures at our side and in hostile environments that they thought they were uninhabitable, and they would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "if there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will reveal the true scope of the findings at the press conference on Thursday.
The conference will participate in the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence & Opposer Block Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60 legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, emerged in Congress, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before beginning the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tronaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, starting with 'bipartisanism', because now there will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, led by the bakery Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, noted that with these reforms institutionally, the political marginality of the PRI and PAN is constituted.
He noted that in the coming days they will speak with the representatives of the NAP and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be attacked again by both parties and the opposition coalition ended.
"So far it has arrived (the opposition coalition), that is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, it continued, that the Congress after having been monopolitical, is now "duopolic".
"It is not the spirit to reform the law that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other colleagues and companions to make them more, the convergent abounds.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that today the Congress became a 'botin' between two, alluding to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're sharing it between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the Member's personality, gave him his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by cupular agreements, let it be left out 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, today the five who see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unify ourselves to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the subject that in the reform they made them agree, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for "the supplier"
Pay Mazatlan City Council another check to the questionable owner of electrical equipment company.
A check for more than 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1 million 200,000 pesos.
According to the municipal transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November, by the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had moved forward that he would go out more money from the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks are left to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, he is simply being paid what is due, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last "resurrected" checks in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Act states when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after the 25th of July, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, which revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to attend tourist sites
Tourist businessmen accident of foreign tourist due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan called on the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites in poor condition and to project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Golden Zone Trade Association, recalled that on several occasions they have denounced the image of fate being taken care of and reverse the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and take him back to the nearby businesses.
"Politics don't know what it's like to close up a company one day and have no idea what money is lost, or otherwise they don't do the works in this way in so long and without proper planning."
Hoteler José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so as it gives preventive maintenance and does not fall into the corrective process only," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only as a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and the Venadite of Mazatlan.
"Today, in order for the tourist to come not only depends on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance on what tourist attractions are," he said.
"No due attention has been given and this kind of fact shows something that is notorious for all, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, because they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up to date, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
" Luckily Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that will have to be ordered first, cleaned up and put on line to make them attractive to add them to the inventory we have to promote to the destination."
Request IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A law of work worthy and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday the 60 legislature has been installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which is a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations of new members of the Congress of the State is that they come into a clean and commitment management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the new 40 members of the Congress of the State assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa due to the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because it is customary to make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become rival carnivals of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
He therefore spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges for the Governing Body in turn.
"We took care that they come to do decent work and especially committed to society and the sectors because it was the signoans who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job generation."
With regard to tourism activity, he asked that the new legislators give him the weight within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with a lower budget and is inconsistent as important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that directly competes with agro industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for detonating tourism projects and to assist in providing security to the state and updating the Alcohols Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
A Magician King Is Seeked
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing but 12 people and a key.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and the clothes they so desire.
The family lives a humble house of the Colonia Salvador Allende and lives up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn't have slavery, but we sell mandarin and papa... I'm already going out in the afternoon with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while her 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo long aspires to have a ‘monster’ car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests clothes size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I want this monster', but I told him 'we'll see son', because he was very expensive," he recalled with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, those who were in school, clothes and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, uses size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, lacks tennis, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family can participate in the campaign You are looking for a Mago King, giving a toy or effective at the reception of Northwest.
Fourteen alleged drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a decade of persecution has been carried out in the framework of dismantling a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen persons have been arrested who will face various charges.
The persecution has occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where the production of drugs was carried out.
"About 750 Cannabis plants have been seized, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security Spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two Sherbrooke men.
The detainees had to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of Cannabis production, possession with the aim of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests," said Mr.Ruel.
In this operation, about seventy officers from the Quebec Security Strait, Sherbrooke Police Service and Memphremagog Police Department participated in the investigation module.
Will be able to fight illegal migration without problems
The Conservative bill that, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the paternal women loaded with clandestine migrants is likely to face great opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created granite that you weigh," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals defend that the bill in its current form, which would allow for the arrest of any person from a ship identified as the transport of illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for up to one year.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against and, apparently, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that indicate that its party is not strong enough with clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree that measures are taken against the leaders of the clandestine fathers, and that is what we want with another bill, C-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," Mrs. Chow explains.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians say to Members that they do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as a fern. "
"They expect Canada to take firm action," says Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government would request a vote to be held so that each Member to oppose is later explained to his electors.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Research since January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday's announcement caught more than one by surprise.
In other words, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critical of the Quebec party that deals with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of the cyst" and as "a last-minute chapucera solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest resists himself in avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead point, suggest Quebec to grant a special mandate to the general intervener to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervener," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing it to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent quadrille is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be from the Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments to this subject.
During the spring 2001 operation related to the pilot groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Act on Gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a plot of land in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, they have evacuated from the houses.
At night, there was another groundcourse in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now to Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the snow reef that has already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Civil Security Unit of Quebec issued alerts for the rivers Ouareau and Acigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overrun of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civilian security unit remains alert and monitors the situation closely, as stated by Annik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Centre, for its part, issued ads on Wednesday, communicating the strong growths of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partially Culpan in Dupont
The Radio Presenter of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback to the Canadian Council of Radiotelevision Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements on social assistance and on Haitians, as well as their crude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his CHOI team 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians and rough language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, do not violate the Codes on Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcast emissions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were not correct.
Presenters should communicate reliable and not misleading data.
Regarding suicide, present Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le Midi" have treated a delicate issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Consequently, any blame has been discarded in this regard.
The last dispute referred to the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been involved in a media confrontation that had triggered numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of rough language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which will, inter alia, have to announce decisions once in the hours of major hearing within three days.
A kung-fu king in Montreal
The Algerian watchdog Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, climbs up the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I seek fighting everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur World Championship in Edinburgh, Scotland, from 23 to 30 October.
"I have won in the category of kickboxing full contact and thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shu World Cup in China."
"They will invite sportsmen who have finished out of the first four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the fifth place tournament, but I won the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this step, I will be the first time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as throw the opponents to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only maintain a competition in his career, he will no doubt attend the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is China's most notorious and prestigious," explains the friendly boy.
"It is like the equivalent of the Limpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand) ".
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost at the end.
"He who has won me is a true professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face at the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without an invitation to tender before the most important contract, the project management, of a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy Gérance, was created in 2004 following the decision by Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the Energy management consortium obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the use of consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and leads to a rise in prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and elimination of competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now openly," stated the member of the Quebec Party Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he does not understand how it can benefit the public interest in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there has been a collision with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, claiming that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "with a lack of rigour."
He noted that "minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, this is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In any event, the contract has been awarded without competition being involved; it has been a negotiation.
Moreover, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the Quebec norm, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devour published last week, the formula of consortia in the technical advisory sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's commercial register allows to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy management consortium, Minister Normandeau has emphasized that "the James Bay territory responds to a particular workforce dynamics and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s."
The great head of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to an invitation to tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract granted to the Energy Georgia consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devour has identified 109 technical advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account his participation in Energy management.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy Administration contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has let it happen that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance it", before it needs to be more concerned with its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The label "green" does not inspire trust
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer of Quebec hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade marks and ecological certificates to guide their elections.
According to the responsible consumption barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages are propelled to defend more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and believes that it even impedes its commitment.
Even if the consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University Consumer Observatory.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "corresponsible", notes the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take political speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the doubtful nature of information make 46% of consumers dismiss this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers also say they are suspicious of the alleged yields of organic products or services that they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of the consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61 per cent has given priority to shopping in the shops of their neighborhood and has preferred to buy grown food in their region, reports the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the rate of responsible consumption has reached 64 points over a maximum of 100 this year), Quebec's Homo consummous loves to occupy the place of the king of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about wildlife protection.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness seems to be from doors (of its car) outside: in 2010, only 28 per cent of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and on foot displacements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to which it has requested that it commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex post the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to re-purchasing Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex in the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and returning his true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would actually be lower than the initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a request of $12.8 million last spring, but since then applications have been reviewed downwards.
President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, submitted a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the possibility of a donation by the State must be completely discarded.
Let's remember that the Association of Film Owners and Cinematographic Complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do demand considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has for ten years carried the charge of the film author in his premises of the complex, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to adhere to his clientele.
Angus and the Parallel company, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open the way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallel, continues to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February, projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des Godes".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not again contacted Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group of proposals have received.
The full Canadian veil is lifted...
New American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to Americans, but reflect both the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-United States relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government get their budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy of Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, offer more juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, that is, during the full federal electoral campaign, reports to what extent the United States does not enter into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This brought great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of virtually inherent inferiority to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, instead of leaving the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), "," he writes.
He concludes, therefore, that the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "enordicating silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
" Logically, you think, the ability of a candidate, of a party and, more importantly, of the leader of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which voters should think about voting."
This feeling of importance can be observed also the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Business Officer in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the government's survival during the confidence vote in early February over the federal budget, through which Canada will for the first time fail in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere does it mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties conditioned its survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington about the increasingly negative image that transmits the dramatic series broadcast in the United States CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable reports that during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but that he depended "on every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that spirits have been warmed up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC's radio that the responsible for this massive escape should be "murdered".
Mike Huckabee is echoed in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancún a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEI) in a quantity that corresponds almost one third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the overall set of major concrete projects that the UN expects to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70 per cent of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GEI issued on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of planetary car park emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, large issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that would reduce global GHG emissions from 53 GT to 49 Gt.
However, still 5 Gt of this quantity should be reduced to stabilize, by 2020, the two-degree-degree temperature increase to prevent it from being out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced by twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80 per cent less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reostats and emit very little heat.
Above them, they contain nothing of mercury.
Several experts have expressed their reservations regarding fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and should be eliminated as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluocompact bulbs, but coal thermal plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is dropped with incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is looking forward to the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, given that the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the interim results immediately," a spokesperson for the UN head.
"Ask all Côte d'Ivoire parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the Wednesday deadline to midnight without publication of the results, three days since Sunday's polling.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the CIS had commented on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, requests have been multiplied in the world that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo band has been cancelled by the Constitutional Council of the "frauding" votes in the north, in the hands of the old rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Côte d'Ivoire, has said that the intimidation maneuvers of the voters carried out by the NFs in the north of the country had discouraged the followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepted Gbagbo ' s complaints.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a nearby political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged "unacceptable" the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council after he has prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidentials, on Sunday, should have put the crane into the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years.
The United Nations has warned on Wednesday the political class of Côte d'Ivoire that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished on the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent of Alassane Ouattara, who received publicly the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25 per cent on the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account overseas departments), as shown by the data corrected with the temporary seasonal variations (CVE) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3 per cent of the working population in continental territory and 9.7 per cent with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, are available within two weeks to work and seek or not employment.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in unemployment to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the sense of ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older persons, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years old, which is 6.6% with the DOM.
There has only been a stability of unemployment among persons aged 25-49 years, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Since 2006, Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, Director of Waste Treatment Companies and Brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for the abuse of social goods, misappropriation of funds and public goods, covering up, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, as indicated by his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is going to fight and answer all the questions raised by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," said AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they started investigating and also imprisoned one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done is take care of the landfills he has to manage.
With regard to the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their implementation, he knows nothing about it, as counsel Simon says.
As part of this dossier, it has also been investigated since Wednesday, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Urban Agglomeration Services, for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but has been released on parole and has prohibited meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have come to you."
"The examining magistrate has taken into account the explanations and has released him," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night on Wednesday, four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of the Property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "trafficking influences and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier have been interrogated by "substracting and embezzlement of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and by "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering the abuse of social goods".
Among the people who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to whiten the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is under way in several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the research indicates that research focuses especially on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne, as well as other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elisha has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", has vilified the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the watchful gaze of US diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "rehens" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought for U.S. justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Eliseo's adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d'Orsay's director for North Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following in order to repatriate their own citizens held in force in Iran.
"Haced noise," they say, "soul continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discreet channels have been exhausted, "the silence will not solve anything," Iranians are "expert at delaying maneuvers."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail".
Announces that Clotilde Reiss prison release (which will take place on 16 August, on the day of refuge at the French embassy) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (EUR 230.000).
He also notes that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "is going to increase".
Iranians could "in the near future stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison after twelve days, but was blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition calls for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The American embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which closes Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of material for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assured us that this was not the case.
Eliseo, he says, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot cancel the decision," he said.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under the "close" supervision of French information services.
Eliseo's counselor marks a telephone number, hangs up and then informs US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Eliseo spares no effort, uses communiqués and "fugas" organized in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that manipulation brings its fruits, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media blitz" of French officials.
What is due such "gratitude" to Mr Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that have led Elisha to set foot on this fiction.
The great communication effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been stained with premature and demeanor."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries to "show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows it's a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we thanked him."
"At least this should cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Eliseo.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who had played an "active role in favour of the release of our country."
From midnight on, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "Cenicenta" that will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as indicated by representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then it's hard for them to study in school and live a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, ministerial officer responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the enforcement of the law, precisely.
The government also proposes to ask companies to limit their daily access time to these games when the parents of young people so request, added the manager.
In addition, it will make it available to those requesting free software to limit internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the indisputable champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee designates Thursday the World Cup organizing countries of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can become dominant over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, since the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emi of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Transactions between backresters, therefore, may last until the last minute.
On the other hand, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the opportunities of his country, the birthplace of football, which only hosted the World Cup once in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the fire on Monday by disseminating a documentary that has highlighted three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the British leaders, who have launched an intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron in the head.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of JJ.OO in London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to regain the brightness of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Duo España-Portugal also has many strong points thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Copa de Europa in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could put their ambitions down.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are all they can do is give points to Russia, converted into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in its candidacy (e.g. stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote", in a direct mention of the English press accusations against EC members.
"They're making their dirty suits shine, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, having experience in 1994, seemed to be the most logical favorites.
The first world economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed a separate excellent project.
However, these new candidatures appear premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the World’s 2026 concession to China, passionately desired by FIFA, would cause Asia to be without possibility by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has submitted its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: proof
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had come to understand that he was doubting.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
A warrant in Elisha leads to another.
The current Head of State will therefore be re-elected in 2012.
However, the evidence does not match well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that he doubts.
Go one side and go the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends stated that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in autumn 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with UMP MPs, Tuesday night at Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused a certain stir.
Is this the official announcement of your application?
Not at all.
The President only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year mandates to two.
He was simply transmitting the facts, not an ad.
It's not the first time he talks about the presidents, with a playful tone, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or better, case, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he was released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think what will come next."
His claims of yesterday are no closer to the candidacy, nor less.
Comments come out for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race by the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Segolène Royal has gone up to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather, the fact that his 2012 candidacy is evident is what leads many PS people to demand that the battle be organized before it is anticipated.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," he immediately and prudently responded to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," says Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to clarify the modalities for the outbreak of the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
Due to the crisis of the European sovereign debt, the Frankfurt Emissions Institute will certainly not be able to be as peremptory if it does not want to risk worsening a more complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equal to high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in the European States.
He did not want to say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, increasing, for example, its procurement programme for State obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
On the eve of the meeting in Brussels before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent about his intentions, stating only that the State Letter Purchase Programme on the secondary market "continued" and that "we shall see what we decided" at the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will maintain its main unchanged rate at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week to some EUR 1,350 million.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday it would have bought again Irish and Portuguese titles.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities for an amount of EUR 67,000 million since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt as little as possible that purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists do not anticipate any significant change in their course.
Although loans operations at more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, it still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial conditions and durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended today for a few months.
"I can't imagine you're going to significantly modify your program."
"If not, I would run the risk of causing new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," Norbert Bräms, an economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of those obligations to keep the market stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Taking into account the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way that it prevents a marked rise in income paid by the most fragile States," said an important liability manager yesterday.
Because, if the interest rates are set by the clouds, States will have even more problems in reducing their indebtedness, or even in stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government covers the time
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation slightly improved yesterday with the decline of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of precarious calm.
On the way out of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have said that Giulio Tremonti heard the situation as "indecipherable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements subsequently denied by the interested party.
In any event, on Tuesday, the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of the bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CRF) had risen to 263 points, causing a certain riot in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "the turbulence in the markets" and possible contamination from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts have provided a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the current Senate budget is based on 1.3 per cent and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the government deficit will represent 4.3 per cent of GDP next year (compared to 3.9 per cent of GDP) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (instead of 2.7 per cent).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary arrangements can be applied after the parties, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of your economy are in order and your accounts are in good condition, as we have said for a long time," says Arigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested by Italy are smaller than those required by other countries," says Pier Carlo Paduan, head economist of the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the House of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated by the end of March.
In that case, a period which would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis would be opened.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of crisis control mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday, at night and by day, that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to the defense of their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday's relaxation in the types of obligations of the European States has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower the debt rating of Portugal, the most frequent target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs heavily on banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas say.
Especially because "political rhythm is much slower than market rhythm".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing crisis exit mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFFE), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a trip by Asia on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, no doubt it prepares the ground.
It is expected that the first issues of EAFRD securities will be carried out next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters agency that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
With regard to the countries on the frontline, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path to which Greece and Ireland followed.
They want to avoid at all costs asking for international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider essential to build confidence in a lasting way.
The capitalist partners of the European Funds finally set out the options available to accelerate the process of standardisation of public bond markets.
By way of Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750,000 million mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to withdraw the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading actor in the European public debt market, believe that an additional amount of about 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, currently equipped with EUR 60 billion.
A council that could certainly examine European capital in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and Ice: 24 Departments on Orange Alert
Snows continue to cause circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on an orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to mid-day and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, strong falling snowfalls affect northern Gironde and Charentes, although it also snowed slightly on France Island.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, from 7 to 10 cm, in the affected departments, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Baja Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosín.
Snows are strong enough to cause difficulties in circulation and affect some economic activities, warning Metéo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited for heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to gendarmes, circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it be conducted only in case of need and that certain TER vehicles have been banned during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation has been banned in Picardia.
No specific measures had been planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "insults all drivers to drive with the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport in Roissy and 10% in Orly due to planned snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro of Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on France's Island has reached its high point, billions have risen.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we speak of the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of EUR 4 billion.
At the theoretical level, this amount will subsequently enable the GSP to obtain market loans to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Amending Finance Act, which was considered in the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the devices planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in office tax on France Island.
The first one, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is an amendment of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate that increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from 4,000 million.
"Tax resources must be added to the EUR 4 billion of the allocation of funds to be mobilised by the State and granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment that income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as explained."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The GSP estimates that it will begin to receive the 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4,000 million are not included in the credit, can lead to a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Hackers vengeful and diligent spies
WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that just seems to scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The norm that secret records should only be formed by news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, I know, editor of the Liberation), which only considers certain what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that sent the American Embassy of Rome to the State Department was the same as the Newsweek published the previous week.
Why, then, have such revolts caused the revelations of these records?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, i.e., that embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of States can be called by telephone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a few limited exercises of representation, have become spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows it perfectly, we just seem to know that we don't know it for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker could consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "verdugues".
But we enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Previously, in Orwell's time, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother controlling every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control each movement thanks to the phone, each transaction performed, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a full victim of the power eye.
But when it is demonstrated, as now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the revenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer retain its own secrets be sustained?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge of Berlusconi or Merkel's character is actually an empty, unsecret secret, since it comes from the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has not harmed Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, as it would be like publishing it on a road map.
But it is also clear that confidential telephone conversations cannot be expected with current technologies.
Nothing is easier than discovering whether and when a Head of State has moved by plane and has contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my forecast is science fiction and, therefore, novice, but I imagine government agents who quietly move in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at most, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
This information is then kept, in a single copy, in closed drawers with key: in the end, the attempt to spy on Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently advances like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has again created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
Video tapes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backwards, discovering all the secrets of assembly, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow you to move forward or back from chapter to chapter, i.e. at huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travels it takes three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing beyond normal that politics and communication techniques bring us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was being planned in secret at the embassies.
The embassies are currently asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's hats in its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the fast-disbursed funding pledges (called fast-start or early) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French carpets have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union undertook to contribute 7.2 billion euros in three years and France 1.260 million euros (i.e. 420 million euros per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has placed its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and was appreciated for what really matter: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion, which puts it on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without damaging official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the reference that best suits him.
For example, the European Commission has made reference to 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years as fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development aid.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, it does not refer to expenditure in previous years or to the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while it seeks to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the sharing between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and each one chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro lent is equivalent to a euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain profitable investments (often projects related to reducing emissions based on more effective technologies), it is false to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At a large level, only the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: "respect" its commitment of EUR 420 million making 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (EUR 36.1 million); see the EU document to see it for its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union which uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it by 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to meet its commitment, France only provides ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start funding, France does double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in time and on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it can give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional", as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has been involved in arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States still giving when they could just lend?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid...
The chapter on early financing is a short-term detail in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But in particular, France could move forward the discussions on the stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive at Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to advance negotiations.
Warning about pesticides eaten by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests on one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Association Generations Futures (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated," acquired food in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September that usually consumes a child about ten years of age in four meals and one snack a day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as golosins, were examined in laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances capable of acting as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although virtually all cases do not exceed the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually, our study clearly shows that exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic wastes and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty wastes that can harm the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided as a tentet for the school, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to green Jews in Kenya, including in food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful banned insecticide in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even bread bar or chicle were lined with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutrient" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these "polluter's cocktails" for the consumer "probably underestimates," says the study.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "against the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of waste of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
