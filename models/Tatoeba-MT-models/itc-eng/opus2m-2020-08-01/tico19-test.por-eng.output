Rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronary artery disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, 1 January-15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although in a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare themselves more for an outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a portion of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Disease Control and Prevention Centre informed the causing agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, i.e., an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the 6% of remaining cases evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and in the United Kingdom and compared them with those of Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with that of Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The issue of 5 March of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of VOCID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of CVID-19 had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the above date 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only in Italy.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom, and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of notified cases from each country by 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. and we compare Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom in general followed those in Hubei Province in China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by 21 February and then significantly increased by 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar increases in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It stresses that, until 15 March at 8 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy for 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of VOCID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This occurs even though countries are at different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for updating.
At the beginning of March 2020, physicians in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 hospitalization in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data with focus on the number of reported cases and number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 inhabitants between 2010 and 2011.
Modelled scenarios related to saturation of health system capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk greater than 90% of the capacity of intensive treatment beds, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
In view of the fact that the cases have so far concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom countries, and hospitals and intensive treatment units generally provide a defined regional coverage population, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should be made available preferably in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's example and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical care, especially intensive treatment, such as in affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions properly, if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure in the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronaryvirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by coronary artery disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the research object, which is developed quickly.
We will address the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help to understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to be confined to the entire holiday and for several weeks following the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus has a great similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its disease was called CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
Until March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients killed.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the " public enemy number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by COV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic of 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as the other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common colds.
However, in this century, we have twice found highly pathogenic human coVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which cause an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with morbidness and frightening mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV epidemic in the documented history of human beings.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1.1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, CoV sequencing was published.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan’s first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, the contagion of health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission among people was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan was confined, with all its interrupted public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Sea Fruit Market, which was considered the site of the onset of the infection by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until this report, the disease has already spread across China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
As the situation gets worse rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centers with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, especially in the age range of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, some were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in groups, especially in Hubei and its surroundings.
The COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The average time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the mass transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus infect humans.
The glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope joins its cell receptors of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) and dipeptidel peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and subsequently membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released in cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA is accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsidium proteins form vesicles containing virions, which join the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% of genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original location of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, the particles of SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in ultrafine sections of the human airway epithelium.
It was found that human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human protein ECA2 in a weaker way than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new orf3b encoded short protein and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may perform a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the human cryo-EM ECA2 structure of total length to the resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for the screening of medicines to suppress the infection with SARS-CoV-2.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs of bats similar to SARS called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the barriers of species and infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry the bat virus to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that the long-lined pangolins, seal mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the 99% genetic homology between a Pangolin discovered CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% in two genomes is a great difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are being awaited (Fig.33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to the heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are efficient in deactivation of the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study was reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can consult only previous studies on other CoVs, especially on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host by means of standard recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll type receptor (TLR), NOD type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I type receiver (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of interferons of type I (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape from immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including supplements such as antibodies C3a and C5a, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure, and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the emergence of symptoms in a group of people, affects more elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a greater chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and, most of the time, 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that the health authorities adjust the effective time of quarantine based on the most accurate period of incubation, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a current practice, individuals exposed to or infected with the virus usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
The fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which may come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, lack of air, muscle pain, vertigo, headache, throat pain, chorrhiza, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved into an acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without any abnormalities in the lung imaging diagnosis, should undergo screening to the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family grouping and a group with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that patients at MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilatory support, much more than the patients of COVID-19, which consists of the higher mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MRS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were shown to be the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
Until February 14, COVID-19's mortality was 2%, when the confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Comparably, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of the confirmed 8.096 cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic R0 reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4, only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a far greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The onset of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same cluster or vehicle, as a cruise ship.
Patients usually present travel history or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it was reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and cured patients who received discharge from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral blood white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cells below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count less than 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with CVID-19.
Enzymes and myoglobin levels in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count presented a progressive reduction.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are present in most patients with COVID-19, and have bilateral irregular shadows or dark glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed an atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ASD).
When ADDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the exchange of gases.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most severe results of chest X-ray usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of the COVID-19 demonstrated the deformation of pneumotics, the formation of the hyalin membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and sincytal cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ADDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as a main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was not only derived from RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to arrive at an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre input) using a measuring rod in less than one hour, without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new VOC, physicians can provide, at the best of their capacity, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of therapies that were previously used or proposed for the treatment of other VOCs such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressive drugs, steroids, plasma of cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used to treat severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine cascade results from an exacerbated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNό, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ADDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of the immune response directed to T cells; the blocking of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; suppression of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe pulmonary injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They may cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the prognosis.
However, short treatment periods with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses were recommended for careful use in patients with seriously ill VOCID-19.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy was confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola virus and Marburg.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple tape RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being very awaited.
In addition, barictinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody generation
The blood collection of patients who have been cured of a contagious disease to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from disease contraction has a long history.
In fact, patients cured usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were cured of COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in severe condition.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the large-scale method before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be considered cautiously.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the plasma demand is large to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat an epidemic of global proportions.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or triage to effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend enormously on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are vague, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China who used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, who used TCM in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and fellow workers published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were considerably lower in the group treated by western medicine and TCM than only in the group treated by western medicine.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than for the group treated only by Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than in the group treated only by Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still await more properly controlled tests on larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of the TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with CVID-19 or suspected of disease generally feel great fear of the highly contagious disease that can be fatal, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychosis symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
Contact tracking and mandatory quarantine, as part of the actions of the public health system against the epidemic of COVID-19, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to people suspected of the disease and to people who had contact with them, as well as to the general population who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and people infected to susceptible hosts, and are usually complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate powerful and durable neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these candidates for vaccine in older individuals and models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before a clinical study begins.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS has disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MERS outbreaks continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruses-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for nonimmun individuals is an urgent and essential task for controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and variations in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical development, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to present underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive treatment (mean age of 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of patients with CVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive treatment are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive ECA2 cholangiocytes, which can lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have strong correlation and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein level (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognosis of the COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also assist in predicting the result.
These enzymes are expressly present in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-rays and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues for predicting outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are usually used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short period in patients with CVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and testify to the death of loved members of the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the initial phase of infection (or cause only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients in the initial phase or period of incubation can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current epidemic of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, and the continuous quarantine of almost the whole population, hoping to interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends until March, and the phase of deceleration lasts between 3 and 4 months.
In the meantime, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat rubble and the mean cornet of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the newly identified virus may become a cyclical episode similar to influenza.
However, promising evidence occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with quarantine and rigid isolation, the disease was kept under control, finally.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker with respect to its infection and, at some point, becomes a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough and spiral and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which creates a new possibility: that of oral-fetal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, work colleagues and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and breath masks N95 (series no. 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent droplets of fluids from a potentially infected individual from being transported in the air or adhered to the surfaces of the objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series no. 1860s) protect against inhalation of verions with size from 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the verions being able to penetrate it completely; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the size of SARS-CoV, and the two have approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health professionals in direct contact with patients should use the N95 masks (series no. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should use isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was using a N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also use transparent facial protectors or protective glasses when serving patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that all wash hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than normal, try to stay at home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
One meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection, as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a great warning to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020 the director of Wuhan Disease Control Center reassured the citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of infection and limited reproduction among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the containment of the disease in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by the citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal medical and authorities communications; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in their initial stage, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) be more often to issue targeted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the system of society response periodically.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries worldwide at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a feeling of return from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than with SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress in the COVID-19 research, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologer has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of SARS-like bats, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus of the original host, of the bat, let's say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut the transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical trials have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and causes subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot obtain a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or will it have seasonal recurrence, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to seek answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, regardless of the efforts required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-volution of co-oconaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild disease, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MES) changed what was thought of the CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating a HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 highlighted the CoVS again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is very useful.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, where they are nonpathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of host animals has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigating the interactions of the host of CoV in animals can also provide important information about the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of existing information about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we compare and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Moreover, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of virus evolution on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and simple tape RNA.
These viruses that present the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed in an electronic microscope.
As for the structure, CoVs have non-segregated genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins of replicasis.
Polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also encoded by different CoV strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genus contains most HCVs and is subdivided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed the barriers of species, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCOVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause serious lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the coral of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause autolimiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of the present and has infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East (MES) respiratory syndrome epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the current coronary virus disease epidemic of 2019 (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The tracking of the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a structure to understand the natural history, the driving force and the restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for reservoir hosts, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration among species.
In this article, we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parental viruses of HCoVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after the transmission of interspecies to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolution trend of HCoV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the first isolation of the strain B814 of HCoV-229E of the coryce of patients who contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including peru, camundong, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was later adapted for growth in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented common cold symptoms, including headache, spire, malaise and throat pain, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in mice brains during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection seem similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomaticly indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients showed severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspatchers", it was estimated that each contaminated person may contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the onset of peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, liver dysfunction and creatine high kinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffusion alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients need, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of the zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially found that the virus was prevalent in small children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The symptoms of chorus, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he has been identified in the Netherlands, he is scattered all over the world.
It was estimated that HCOV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its incidence of peak occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crupe.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in a community way, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Just as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four HCoVs acquired in a Community way have adapted well to human beings and are generally less likely to undergo mutation and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has been reported recently as a cause of serious respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to maintain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most cases confirmed by laboratory originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and in Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to SARS, among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed by laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating human knowledge viruses.
From half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which were known retrospectively to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continuing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and also named the COVID-19 disease.
By 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4 per cent.
It is noted that the lethality related to the confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can evolve rapidly into acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus in the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCOVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the period of incubation and the duration of the evolution of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCOVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCoVs acquired in a Community way (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during HCoV infection acquired in a community manner, including the presence of non-specific symptoms, soft or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is somewhat lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in community-acquired HCOVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing on to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in the same way as the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the oro-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can display seasonality, such as in cases of HCoVs acquired in a community manner.
In any event, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after their passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current epidemic of COVID-19.
All HCoVs acquired in a Community way that causes mild symptoms have adapted well to human beings.
From another perspective, it can also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient HCOV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop serious diseases of HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent in order to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Several years ago, the four CVs acquired in a community way circulate in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to human beings, and their transmission among human beings cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and take advantage of the opportunity to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs acquired in a community manner.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as HCoVs acquired in a Community way, at least until now.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs acquired in a community and less pathogenic way than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will completely adapt to human beings and circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediate host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of a HCOV if it houses a direct relationship ancestor, sharing high homology at nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts HCOV continuously and permanently.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoV or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to human beings, it does not adapt properly to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate in a transient manner and then transmitting it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
An HCoV may have the infection interrupted if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In that case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the SARS zero patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Further investigation of seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of antiSARS-CoV IgG, compared with that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a dog-guaxinim in the markets of live animals were initially identified as carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was reported after the slaughter of all civeta in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild masked palm civets or farms without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could only be the intermediate host amplifier, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals may serve as intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV amplifiers cannot be excluded.
All these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search by the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a close relationship bat coV, named CoV HKU3 Rhinolophus bat related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese bat.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other CoVs of bats share 88% to 92% of homology with SARS-CoV in nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs similar to SARS (SL-CoVs) were also identified in bats, but no CoV, except for WIV1, can be isolated as live viruses.
It is known that human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is the receptor of SARS-CoV.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 derived from fecal bat samples uses ECA2 of bats, civets and human beings as a receptor for cell entry.
It is intriguing that the serum of convalescent SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
Up to now, WIV1 represents the ancestor with the closest relation to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not immediate SARS-CoV reservoir hosts.
The phylogenetic analysis groups the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of bats and the CoV-HKU5 of bats.
The CoV-HKU4 of bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receiver, dipeptil-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA polymerase sequences are phylogenetically closer to betaCoV counterparts of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV was found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of bats, share only 87% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate container host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the dromedaries are seropositive to MERS-CoV specific neutralization antibodies, as well as camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal rubble of dromedaries, increased evidence that camels serve as the legitimate container host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noted that symptoms generally mild, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit viruses not only by the respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses in bats.
However, there are still no answers, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which can be attributed plausibly to transmission between people or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that house MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a RATG13 bat CoV, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is very large to assign a parent relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate SARS-CoV-2 reservoir hosts, unless CoVs almost identical to bats are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2 should be set up among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Sea Fruit Attack Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission of animals to human beings.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also house ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new Pangolim CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to the RaTG13, with about 90% identity at nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a domain of connection to the receptor (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% of identity following amino acids.
In a huge contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 DLRs are more divergent, although they present a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study on sick pangolins also reported finding viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual healing to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolim is one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence that confirms the direct origin of the pangolim SARS-CoV-2 due to the difference in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even lower than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pandolim, the betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the betaCoV DLRs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 derives from the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter argument favours the recombination between the betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an impelling force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses was also studied.
phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from CoVs of bats, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a coV of bats called ARCoV.2 (CoV of Appalachian Ridge) detected in the North American tricolor bat presented a direct relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also a suspicion that the camelides are their intermediate hosts.
For more clarity, the current knowledge of the animal origins of HCoVs known is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The HCoV-229E interspecies transmission history is less clear.
AlfaCoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E were discovered.
Among them, there's an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of bat virus to humans.
First, human beings, but not alpacas, can contact bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, human beings have direct contact with the alpacas.
Second, the alphaCoVs of bats related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alphaCoV of alpacas caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpacal alphaCoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain from human beings the alphaCoV related to HCoV-229E.
Actually, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to human beings.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as a HCoV-229E genetic pool, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just like in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to human dromedaries and dromedaries.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV into the dromedaries dates back to decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable storage host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a mild disease and sustains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, since their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with bats through the slaughter or coal mines.
Secondly, the pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts, in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had been introduced.
Human beings contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies produced by domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of host animals, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating CoVs to cross the barriers of species.
First, its mutation rate is relatively high in RNA replication.
Compared to other simple tape RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the CoVs can be considered "moderated" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with a review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessive high mutability and attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue redesivir suppresses the replication of the CoV by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising antiSARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of the CoVs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who maintains contact with human beings.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly make vaccines and antivirals ineffective against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in CoVs exercises extra plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolutionary, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when the conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of single reading tables and protein functions coded in relation to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Third, CoVs swap models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a single "copy choice" mechanism.
In a host serving as a mixing container, the exchange of tapes occurs frequently during the transcription of the RNA of the CoV.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can be recombined to generate new CoVs.
phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs, such as batCoV-HKU9.
Host virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civic SARS-CoVs, it is believed that SARS-CoV is undergoing a rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in the S protein DLR.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is carefully selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the DLR is in amino acids 318o to 510o in fragment S1, which binds to human ECA2, as well as its receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognize the ECA2 receptors of several animals, including bats, civets, mice and dogs-guaxinins, enabling the transmission of the virus's interspecies.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral isolates and from civets in the DLR, and four of them are located in the receptor binding motive for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has mutations K479N and S487T in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of spike protein interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in protein S1 unit implies that the binding affinity of its protein S with human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times greater than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other corrective device may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different portion of protein S.
There are several other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptides N for HCOV-229E and silic acid 9-O-acetylate for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these CoVs into human beings after the interspecies transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of HCoVs' interspecies transmission is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between human beings and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp the dependency factors with the host and overturn the host restriction factors for an effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of host virus interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-tending screening with range of host dependency genome and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
Rise of new HCOVs: back to stake zero
The diversity of the CoVs of bats provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCOVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also boost the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, it is believed that ORF8 is important in its adaptation to human beings, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but it was found that they codify divergent ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic of exclusion of nucleotide 29 of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternance.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoV lines and rangeCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV underwent recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCOVs, in which HCOVs are recombined with other animal coVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from relief of the selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as the pressure of the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpacal alphaCoV has a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in the frames.
Finally, but no less important, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It is likely that bats are well adapted to the anatomic and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminating cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the natural exterminating cell inhibitor receptor NKG2/CD94, and to the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ERO) generated from high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress the replication of CoV and affect the revision by exorribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
Pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to adapt the host.
Therefore, it is not by chance that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause at most mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They respond immensely without causing a high immune response from the host.
This document contains explanations about the discovery of asymptomatic patients and the cause of serious cases in human infection.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, where the higher the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic patients, the immune response was switched off from the CoV replication.
The same immune response shutdown strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLP3 inflammation in bats is poor.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of inflammation NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it was discovered that betaCoV of bats shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a CoV of bats that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets have viruses similar to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that the pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or the betaCoVs of the pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by man accidentally or intentionally.
The CoVs returned to world attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of the CoVs in bats and other animals dramatically changed our perception of the importance of the zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in the transmission between human beings.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in the bat and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between human beings and civets in the markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, the pangolins should be removed from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple betaCoV lineages of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through the pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of such transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach must be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, the coVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the crisis of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many features that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonotic virus reservoirs.
Several pieces of the puzzle from the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true middle host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including human beings, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, a pangolim or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid guidance guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronovirus infection of 2019 (2019-nCoV).This guide transmits our experience and is a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, the coronary virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is officially now referred to as the cronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus is called kronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guide published online at the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He has attracted excellent attention since publication.
However, it notes that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on constant findings of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in some context.
Our guide now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We wear your meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs updating according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (Seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological historical elements with two items of clinical manifestations to perform a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to comply with three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and in nearby areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and near areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with confirmed cases (more or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces, such as home, office, classroom etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) diagnostic features by image of the infection with COVID-19; (3) total white blood cells count showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the initial stage of symptom onset.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR examination for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity compared to the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for specific IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in serum examination; or any change in the specific IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can note that the real-time PCR examination for nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory tract was added to the second and third edition (18-22 January 2020, respectively).
The pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth and fifth edition (of 27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal detection kit of nucleic acid for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped to bring the positive result of specific antibodies to confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us of paying attention to symptomatic and atypical asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we await the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they verify and obey the latest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guide in good time to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
On the date of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research of Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online newsmagazine, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two were between 51 and 60 and one was between 41 and 50.
She also said that two of the victims were from Daca.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video release, the Bengali minister of road transport and Obadul Quader bridges said that public transport would be paralyzed for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
This paralysis of public transport began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March, in two people who returned from Italy and also in one of them's wives.
On March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections in the world
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infections by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the world passed from one million, indicated the data of Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea stated that until Thursday it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronary virus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within 24 hours before 10 hours at the Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US caused by coronary virus infections on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1st.
In the national sphere, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without coming to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency in 15 days. The vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended to the whole day the duration of the curfew of gathering in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3 to 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to implement pickup tap from 22h to 4h
Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home by May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce limits of toilet paper by transaction
On Saturday night and Sunday, Australian Woolworths and Coles stores networks reduced the restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper, respectively, for two packages and a transaction package in all stores in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a package limit.
These limitations were reported by messages in the boxes and Facebook pages of the networks.
Because of the fear of the COVID-19, buyers were supposed to store in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper with home delivery to a package on request.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four transaction packages implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in her March 8 press release, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still exhausting stocks within less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand "no precedents", while ALDI called her "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had an "increased increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco store in Camberra also limited the amount allowed to two packages last week.
To alleviate even more the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI pre-available stocks from a planned promotion for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Varegists, said that retailers try to increase stocks, but that restrictions of the local board regarding the frequency of truck deliveries make that difficult.
It expects high production costs, since suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to carry out the promotion of Wednesday.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail specialist at the University of Technology of Queensland, said stores reposition stock every night.
He stressed that the toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that when exhausted leaves many empty spaces in the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion [of] that if there was an abundant amount in the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [buried] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, said Russel Zimmerman to ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives Crap said last Wednesday that they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who produces the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being made with buyers entering strike on the extended weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin daily print, included an eight-page insert in order to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Initially, the stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also with high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
Just as in Australia, on Sunday night, the British Ocado online supermarket limited the purchases of toilet paper Andres to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandamy" indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous specific cases are, WHO emphasized the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for an answer, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and gravity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Disease Control and Prevention Centres, it is a "unprecedented" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "outside the influence, no other respiratory viruses were monitored from emergence to continuous global dissemination."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus".
And he went on "and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO January decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the outbreak, "in short, will get worse".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronovirus pandemic is a continuous coronovirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, an international emergency of public health of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
It is estimated that the mortality rate is 4% in China, while overall it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include handwashing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from people and monitoring and isolation of people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, pick-up touches, risk controls at the workplace and closure of establishments.
The pandemic caused a severe global socio-economic interruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events and widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by panic-initiated purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the population in the world.
Disinformation about the virus spread online and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descent and appearance of East and Southeast Asia and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy-duty closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
To a large extent, the cases were linked to the Huanan Sea Fruit Attacker market and, therefore, it is believed that the virus has a zoonotic origin.
The outbreak cause virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has close connection to the coronaviruses of bats, pandolim and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms of knowledge became ill on December 1, 2019 and did not present visible connections to the later group of the seafood market.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds had market links.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case was reported by 17 November 2019 in a 55-year-old Hubei province individual, who may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases declared decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases for the first time.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
Until February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people 19 years of age or under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's leading scientific consultant, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive according to the official protocols.
Until March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries had adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that, until 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic number of reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it can be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most common 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, by 5 February, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official count of deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and had positive tests for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without having done the test, for example, who died at home, in homes of rest, etc.
The partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official count of deaths due to COVID by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesman for the U.S. disease control and prevention centres (CCD) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by episode reports of underreporting in the US. This subestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan, on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1st in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14th.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time from the initial outbreak and by the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the fatality coefficient estimates fell from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die due to a disease, and the lethality rate of infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die due to the disease.
These statistics are not static over time and follow a specific population of infection by resolution of the case.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Evidence Based Medicine Center at Oxford University estimates that the fatality rate of infection for the pandemic is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
WHO asserts that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change according to the site.
Maciej Boni, from the State University of Pennsylvania, stated that, "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach its peak and then decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when it will happen."
China's senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "it can end until June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO's recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, declared that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue in circulation for a year or two".
According to the study by Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancement and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (potentially within 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronary virus will disappear completely, since it is highly transmissible" and "that it may become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of the recurrence will depend on group immunity and the extent of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (catarro), loss of olfactory sensation, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CCD) lists that emergency symptoms are the difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty in walking and face and lips with blue coloring. It is recommended to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory discomfort syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with results of the tests that confirm the infection, therefore, researchers recommend that those who were in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be monitored and examined closely to rule out infection.
Chinese asymptomatic ratio estimates range from some to 44%.
The usual period of incubation (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory feeling was initially 30% and then dropped to 15%.
Some details on how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and small drops produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, being the next contact considered from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering your mouth can make the droplets reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by drops that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breath drops can also be produced during the expiration, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally in suspension.
The gothicles may lie in the mouths and noses of close people or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in air spread.
Propagation can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it can spread through the faeces, it is believed that the risk of this happening is low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oro-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in subsequent stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission was identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, although the ease with which the disease spreads is not fully clear, a person usually infects from two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for one day in paperboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Estimate animals and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
The coronovirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of coronavirus related to its nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgeneral Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same strain are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, across the genome level, to other coronavirus samples from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolins virus and humans.
The comparison of the entire genome, so far, has found a maximum of 92% of genetic material sharing between the coronavirus of the pandolim and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms. The definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or computed tomography (TC).
A study in Wuhan, comparing RRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its image characteristics matching with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC is not used for screening or as a front-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be performed in respiratory or blood samples.
The results are normally made available from a few hours a day.
Generally, this test is performed in nasopharyngeal rubble, although the throat rubble is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these had proved sufficiently accurate to be approved for general use.
A serological test developed by Cellex, in the United States, was approved for use in emergency only by certified laboratories.
The particularities of the X-ray images and computed tomography (TC) of symptomatic people include opacities in asymmetric dark glass and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an international online database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus infection, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with those of the PCR and showed that although the image is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect image characteristics of the virus with X-rays and CT.
Strategies to avoid transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper sheet and placing this scarf directly on a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential journeys going to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of Community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they have been infected. It is recommended that health professionals take care of individuals who may be infected to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use by the localization data governments from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with the International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement asking for limits to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to register a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for the COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as, for example, rinse your nose and throat with colutoria, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing your hands is recommended to avoid spreading the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. You should also wash your hands before eating and after swiping your nose, cough or sneeze.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand hygiene with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol when there is no soap and water readily available.
WHO advises to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (in up to one minute exposure to disinfectant to a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2–7.5% iodopovidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by sick people should be disinfected in case of suspicion or confirmation COVID-19 on a site.
Health organizations recommend covering their mouth and nose with the folded elbow or with a paper sheet when coughing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any sheets.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since using a mask may limit the volume and distance of expiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO has published instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The use of masks can reduce the propensity of people touching their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without adequate hygiene of their hands." It has also been recommended to use masks by caregivers of people who may have the disease.
WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as the caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that using masks can help people not touch their face.
In several countries, the use of masks for the face by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical mask for the face made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming into contact with another person (make 1 meter or less distance).
In Hong Kong, the use of surgical masks is recommended when using public transport or when remaining in crowded places.
The health authorities in Thailand are encouraging people to make face masks at home and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without using a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear facial mask when leaving in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone entering supermarkets should wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear masks for their face in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on inter-municipal trains and buses use masks for the face from 1 April.
In Panama, it is mandatory to use masks for the face when going out on the street. At the same time, the production of masks at home was recommended for those who could not buy.
Masks for the face have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
The social distance (also known as physical distance) involves infection control actions to slow the transmission of the disease through the reduction of close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centers.
Social distance methods can be applied by everyone when they stay at home, limit their travels, avoid crowded areas, use contactless greetings and keep away from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by the U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no knowledge of transmission of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, whether virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancement" led to the implications that social isolation was needed completely instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspected that they were infected.
The health agencies issued detailed instructions for proper self-inclusion. Many governments demanded or recommended self-forty for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive instructions of self-hundred were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with a wide-scale transmission that make 14 days of self-hundred from the moment of the last possible exposure were advised.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as to present other measures to control infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce: the measures taken now serve to reduce the speed of the spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time in combination.
The suppression requires more extreme measures in order to reverse the pandemic to a rate of basic reproduction lower than 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic. That is what we call "purchasing the epidemic curve".
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions which are not of pharmaceutical nature and which may administer the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks for the face and self-quarantine; Community measures aimed at physical distancement, such as closing schools and cancelling events leading to agglomerations; community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of contact surfaces. More drastic actions, in order to contain the outbreak, were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear. Whole cities, for example, were in quarantine and travel bans were imposed.
Other countries have taken various measures to make the spread of the virus limited.
South Korea, for example, presented mass screening and localized quarantines. Moreover, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they carried out the self-hundred and, for those who did not do so, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those who store medical supplies were punished. Simulations performed in the United Kingdom and in the United States show that the reduction (the decrease in the rate of infection, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e., the reversal of the epidemic growth) present great challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce demand peak by health services in 2/3 and deaths in half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, while overloading health systems.
Removal may be the best alternative, but needs to be maintained while there is the circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if this happens before. Otherwise the transmission occurs again so soon the relaxation of the measurements occurs.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts to develop medicines, which include the existing drug test.
The use of cold medicines that do not require medical prescription, drinking quite liquid and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, it may be necessary to use oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid.
The use of steroids may make the condition worse.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "home and traditional" medications can alleviate the symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat outbreaks.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to relocate, at various levels, their resources, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with positive testing for COVID-19, as well as the increase of intensive care capabilities through the training of staff and the increase in the number of beds and fans available.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first known case in the new coronavirus dates from 1 December 2019, in Wuhan city, in Hubei province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the Huananan seafood wholesaler market. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian, at Hubei Provincial Hospital. The following day, the doctor informed the Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-type coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The Wuh Municipal Health Commission made a statement to the population on 31 December and informed WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to the Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was spread by other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the new Chinese year and by the fact that Wuhan was a transport center, as well as a main point of rail connection.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had already developed the symptoms by 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy, with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have already had at least one case.
Depending on the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The country's reactions included containment measures such as quarantine (also known as house confinement orders, household containment orders or lockdowns) and pick-up touches. On 2 April, around 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are somehow confined to the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, around 59 million people are confined to South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined to India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests a previous case of 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia for unknown causes on December 26. His hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control on December 27.
Initial genetic tests on 27 December 2019 in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronaryvirus.
A communiqué to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications took place, Wuhan doctors were warned by the police by "scattering rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there is no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "people's war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of humanity", a sanitary cord was announced on January 23 to interrupt trips to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities of Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The celebrations of the Chinese new year, on January 25, were cancelled in several locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to care for more patients.
Together with newly built hospitals, China converted 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention and stadium centers. On 26 January, the government launched more measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issue of health statements for travellers and the extension of the spring festival holiday.
Universities and schools in the whole country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have taken various measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were performed in and out of Hubei.
Public transport has been modified, and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
The control of public movement was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) went through some sort of restriction of exits. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid "importing" the virus from other countries.
On 23 March, mainland China had only one domestic transmission case in five days, in this case, by means of a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had basically been blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China's Foreign Minister announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of individuals with visas or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details as to when this policy will be closed.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The Council of State declared a day of mourning, beginning with a moment of three minutes of silence in the whole country, on April 4 at 10 o’clock, matching the Qingming Festival. However, the central government asked families to pay their tributes online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020 the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country's national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On 22 February, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korea military bases were placed in quarantine after testing that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The schedule of the air lines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and most well organized program in the world in terms of sorting the population for the virus. The country also isolated people infected and tracked and placed in quarantine those who came in contact with them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual report of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile application, test of the virus by drive-thru, with results available the following day, in addition to the increase in test capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in the control of the outbreak, although it did not put whole cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided as to the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans signed petitions requesting Moon's impeachment under the claim of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or exalting its response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of lower cases in four weeks.
On 29 March it was announced that from 1 April all new arrivals from outside should enter quarantine for two weeks.
Through media reports on 1 April, South Korea received requests for help with the testing of the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included cancelling concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, closing universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran had five trillion Riyas for the fight against the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be put in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although a heavy traffic between cities before the New Year Persian Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
In the form of claims to cover the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their cases related to Iran on 28 February indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed with 23 of its 290 members with positive test for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch vehemently asked the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders arrested for peaceful dissidents, and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The body stated that there is a greater risk of spreading the virus to closed institutions as detention centers, which also suffer from the lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number since the beginning of the outbreak in the country.
At least 12 current or retired politicians and government officials died as a result of the disease until March 17.
Until March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to Coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that the US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the financial capacity of the country to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights called for economic sanctions to be alleviated for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed as having spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases began to increase sharply, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree of law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak areas, people's entrances and exits are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities by the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Series A football matches, have to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy went to China as the country with more deaths related to Coronavirus in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths related to the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical supplies to Italy.
From April 5, it had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all who had the virus so far may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK response to the virus arose first as one of the softest in the affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for the recognized lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement advising the interruption of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as quickly as possible, and committed to paying 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2,500 per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distance measures, preventing agglomerations with more than two persons and restricting trips and outdoor activities to the minimum necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police by issuing fines and dispersal of agglomerations.
Most of the businesses received orders to close, with exceptions for business considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacy, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and car shop.

On 28 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control — the US government’s leading public health institute — announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start for the tests, which obscured the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
The test was marked by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of approval by the federal government for test kits that were not from the government (of academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested until the beginning of March (a medical request was subsequently required).
Until February 27, Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.
Until March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been performed.

On the other hand, China’s aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO observed the contrast between the outbreak of SARS 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hindered the prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid panic close to the festivities in the new lunar year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a WHO recommendation" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated." On 30 January, after confirming the transmission of humans out of China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as the Public Health Emergency of International Scope (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was invoked due to "the risk of global dissemination, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that interfere unnecessarily in international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and displacement."
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to fund a strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency to assist these countries that "they do not have systems in place to detect people who contracted the virus, and even if it arises".
Tedros made further statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community "invest now or will have to pay later." On 11 February, WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide the "power of the whole United Nations system as a response".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team has been activated, as a result, allowing the coordination of the entire response of the United Nations, which WHO declares will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and developmental context resulting from the outbreak".
On 14 February, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was empowered to provide assistance to international experts and WHO on land in China and to assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and field visits to assess "the impact of response activities on the levels of provinces and municipalities, including urban and rural panoramas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of Coronavirus", stating that, although it was too early to declare a pandemic, countries should still set up "a preparatory phase".
In response to an emerging outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that global assessment of the threat of Coronavirus would be "high" to "very high", is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a declaration of reality for every government on the planet: Agree.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," insisting that correct response measures could help the world to avoid "the worst."
Ryan has still stated that current data did not authorize public health officers to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "deeply concerned about alarming levels of dissemination and severity, and at alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced many criticisms of what was seen as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition from the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation, signed by 733 thousand people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights specialists emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to interventions to save their lives and that the government is responsible.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that each individual has the right to health, including disabled people, minorities, the elderly, people with mental problems, the homeless, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups who need government help.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on political responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.

The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the UK Minister of Cabinet, Michael Gove, and the son of Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro for the management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Administrators at China's Communist Party Province (CPC) were resigned because of their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent the political establishment's response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public anger in relation to the emergence of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officers, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected an early recognition of the outbreak of Coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 originating in the USA or Italy.
The administration of the United States of Donald Trump referred to Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuh Virus" saying China's censorship "overpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and "a way of diverting the administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has achieved a U.S. government cable with a detailed strategy of communication with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being cited as "This has everything to do with China.
We have been advised to try and obtain these messages in any way, including press conferences and television shows. "Canals such as Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have indicated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for a global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy leader, Josep Borrell, warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a trendy and 'polytic' point of view.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively disseminating the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to suspend its sanctions to Syria, Venezuela and Iran while allegedly sending help to those countries.
The Jack Ma Donation of 100,000 masks for Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
The United States authorities were also accused of diverting the aid to other nations to their own country.
And he hears disputes related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
Turkey has also confiscated hundreds of fans for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with those affected by Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa, quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic offensive".
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Mayo dispensed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov said that "to offer help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good phase, they would also act reciprocally if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be maintained on a small scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk not only the lives of the United States troops and the various European countries that are participating, but the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen political or former political figures.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders, asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts anticipate that this may adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of re-elected as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts, after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a quarantine of two weeks in places designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions asking for Moon's impeachment in relation to those they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising their response. The pandemic allowed countries to approve emergency laws as an answer.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could enable governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those considered to have spread false news about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The outbreak of Coronavirus has been blamed for several cases of shortage of supplies, resulting from increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The Food and Administration of the United States issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and interruptions from the supplier.
Several locals also experienced the panic-driven shopping event which led to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortage of supplies.
The particular technology industry has warned of delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhamom, the demand for personal protective equipment rose 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to 20 times the normal price and also caused delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with WHO's warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formulae for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food, both areas were spared from an acute food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products were successful, avoiding the shortage of acute food that was foreseen in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production did not observe a large reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in Wuhan city, and Chinese government officials released pig meat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was very hit in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%.
Since Continental China is a large economy and manufacturing center, viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate of a specialist at Washington University in St. Louis indicated an impact of $300 billion on the world supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is supposed to have "confounded" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to a low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside of China Continental.
On 27 February, due to increasing concerns about the outbreak of Coronavirus, several U.S. stock exchange indices including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry average showed its most significant falls since 2008, with Dow's fall in 1,191 points, the biggest fall in one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indices ended the week with a lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative perspective.
The actions fell again on the basis of concerns with the coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
Many consider a probable economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the effective emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closing public places including tourist spots, and recommending governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British Flybe regional airline collapsed.
The impact on the cruise sector was of a level never seen.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the Chinese New Year's holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many New Moon Year events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most of the workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in shop times or temporary closures.
Visits to resellers in Europe and Latin America fell 40%.
North American and Middle East resellers observed a 50-60% drop.
This also resulted in a 33-43% fall in pedestrian traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Shopping Centers worldwide imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check buyer temperature, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would happen in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were left at home in interior provinces or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for government assistance.
The outbreak of Coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate may reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (which are paid by means of daily pay) unemployed. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families went through some kind of unemployment. Almost 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second 15th of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment aid and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit programme. Almost half a million companies in Germany put their workers under work programmes with reduced hours subsidized by the government known as Kurzabeit.
The German low-time work programme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
Performatic arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations, as well as the people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
The arts and culture sector organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public and help artists whenever possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance sites, and other cultural institutions were endlessly closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and highly accelerated impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film sector also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of Holy Week in Rome, which would occur during the last week of the period of the Christian Lent, had been canceled.
Many dioceses recommended that elderly Christians stay at home than attending Mass on Sundays; some churches provided church services via radio, live streaming online or television while others offer drive-in-style cults.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the square of St. Peter empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled the services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwars.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims, as well as their residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled for a date after 2020, but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other games locations around the world were closed and presence poker tournaments were also postponed or canceled.
This led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new enrollment rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tours.
Many great theaters like Broadway also cancelled all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live shows or creating online "festives" for artists to present themselves, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several memes on the Internet about coronavirus are spread, as many seek humor and entertainment amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people of focus in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidences of fear, mistrust, and hostility were observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Results from February (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserve the virus or are receiving a fair punishment for what they caused.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed to those in areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak in new countries, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pressuring the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to the Trending Topics on Twitter.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump was the target of criticism by referring to the coronary virus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from north-east India bordering China, and students in the big cities of India allegedly suffered persecution related to the outbreak of coronary viruses.
The president of the unity in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that's why God turned against them".
The comments were later condemned by the Consulate of China in Calcutta, who called it "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign waste" and targets of "discharge".
Many newspapers with paid access removed them from some or all coverages on the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors made available scientific articles related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their conclusions as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for Coronary Coronovirus Respiratory Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS - CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (sorology) can be used for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very mild to be reported or who were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of disease mortality and the level of livestock immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variability probably still substantially affects mortality rates of registered cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal rubble or saliva sample.
The results are generally available within a few hours or 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharynx scrubbing is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the material of the samples can be removed from the bottom of the respiratory tract by sucking catheter or material ejected by expectoration (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the actual reverse-time polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), and serves as a base for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
He is looking for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronoviruses, and the RdRp-specific SARS-CoV-2 gene. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the approval for emergency use of the National Medical Products Administration of China for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR detection kit. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from RTCR in real-time for public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests due to failures, and one obstacle to testing in the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable by 28 February 2020, and only from then on the local and state laboratories were allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an authorization for emergency use. The commercial laboratories started the tests at the beginning of March 2020.
From 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for the RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Quest Diagnostics also made the nationally available COVID-19 tests from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction was announced; sample collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours on a wide scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for Holgic, LabCorp, and Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cephoid also received an FDA US for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermic nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it in particular to the protein of the new coronovirus (N protein) of the new coronovirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "thorax X-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the initial stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, can be present even before symptoms arise".
Typical characteristics in CT include bilateral multilobar opacity in dark glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve according to the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, with many of its image aspects matching with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or soon after symptoms have arisen, to determine immunity, and in the monitoring of the population. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through remote laboratory tests (POC).
High productivity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection stage is not necessary before the test. On 26 March 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and from now on are able to distribute their antibody tests.
From 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an authorization for emergency use. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics have received European approvals for their testing kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in question of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
The antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the acquired antibody test kits were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspected patients may stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they must blow saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result shortly afterwards. British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they are in the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used. In the drive-thru tests for VOCID-19 in suspected cases, a health professional collects samples taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea perform some of the country's fastest and most comprehensive tests. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Doctors stated on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 outpatient tests per day, with 10,700 being tested the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020, a total of 483.295 samples were tested until the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, gathering samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory of 2000 m2 for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese:
With the construction supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if this test capacity did not have an online access.
Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily income was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source models released by Origami Assays were released as capable of testing up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19, using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without the need of robotic manipulators for liquids.
In March, insufficient shortages or quantities of reagent became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols involving the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the genomes of the RNA for additional tests. On 31 March, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates are now doing more per capita tests in its population for the Coronavirus than other countries, and they would be on their way to increase the test level and reach most of the population.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a mass processing laboratory for population scale of Group 42 and BGI (inspired by its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to operate outside China.
Different methods of testing aimed at different components of the coronovirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany's method of manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that have no resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centre was not available until January 28, there was delay in the tests available to the US and to China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of the testing kits right at the beginning of the outbreak, in addition, those countries with Australia failed to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts say that the wide availability of South Korea for testing helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs such as the best way to delay the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the wide spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in US private laboratories, and the supply of cotton and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems accurately in its test kits.
In the United States, the CDC test kits showed "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private tests. Spain acquired testing kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results imprecise.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be a result of a failure in the collection of samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish minister said that he would cancel the kits that produced incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China produced incorrect results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million testing kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the testing kits of purchased Turkey from China had a "high error fee" and that they would not "use them." The UK acquired 3.5 million testing kits from China, but at the beginning of April 2020 it announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were placed in quarantine.
With the displacement to the restricted commune, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore in 2020 has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began to strongly advise the inhabitants to stay at home on March 28, but the schools reopened within the planned period after the holiday on March 23.
Many other countries have also administered the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that performed more tests, compared to the number of deaths, had more lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or little symptom.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" is influenced by country testing policy.
A country that only tests people admitted to hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they present symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Washing hands (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
The washing of hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by gold-fetal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's bush or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling meat, franc or raw fish.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends the hygiene of the hands:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After swapping diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After sneezing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or discards of animals.
The clinical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main objective of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who manage food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decreasing the infant mortality rate in births performed at home.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for hand washing can lead to small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce episodes of diarrhea in about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to poor areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with the washing of hands with soap. The washing of hands with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRAs), such as automatic behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, main IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the life of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and joint pneumonia are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, transforming the washing of hands with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into an entrenched habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths by diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections in one room.
Hand washing is generally associated with other sanitary interventions as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene facilities (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause damage to the skin due to skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a condition of peeling and irritation in the skin known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health system workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (CCT).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (miction, defecation), after cleaning a child's bumbum (bum) before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling meat, fish or raw chicken.
Other situations where the correct technique for hand washing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treatment of a cut or injury; after sneezing, coughing or grinding your nose; after touching animal wastes or dealing with animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest index with 97 percent; the United States was close to the average with 77 percent; and China with the lowest index with 23 percent. Various methods for changing behavior currently exist to increase acceptance of the habit of washing hands with soap in critical periods. Collective washing of hands for children in schools in certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to induce washing of hands in children's habits.
The " Essential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
The desparasitation twice a year, complemented by the washing of hands daily with soap, the brushing of teeth daily with fluoride, are at the center of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution, and to increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic dirt, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a soap in contaminated bar concluded that transmission is unlikely as bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic dosing commands is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps were widely disseminated to the public aware in terms of health.
So far, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotics-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, although antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulae may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, vegetable extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps aimed at the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for handwashing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster in body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oiliness that retains dirt and bacteria.
Unlike popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective to reduce microbial load in hands.
A hand hygiene or anti-septic is a non-aqueous basic hand hygiene agent.
At the end of the 1990s and early twenty-first century, non-alcohol-based basic hand hygiene agents (also known as an alcohol-based hand hygiene product, an anti-septic hand hygiene product, or a hand hygiene agent) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbon (polymer or acrylic acid), gel, or umectant, such as glycerin, liquid, or foam to facilitate use and reduce the effect of alcohol drying.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hands hygienicizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% of alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based hygienicizers kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygienicizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands, 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand hygienicizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand hygienicizers are almost totally ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for the hands or alcohol-based hygienizers can be used to moisten or well cover both hands.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their ends are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The tips of the fingers should also be washed well, being rubbed with both palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand hygienicizers, especially when hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid exterminating action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace the appropriate washing of hands unless soap and water are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand hygienicizers can lead to skin re-drying unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The alcohol re-drying effect may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand hygienicizers containing emollients caused substantially less irritation and drying in the skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in the hands hygiene based on alcohol rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritant contact dermatitis has become an attractive compared to the washing of hands with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous basic agents do not wipe the hands of organic matter, they only disinfect them.
That is why hand hygiene is not as effective as water and soap for preventing the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens still remain in their hands.
The efficacy of non-alcoholic hand hygiene agents is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically has fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based hygienizers.
More recently, formulations that use benzalconium chloride have shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, different from alcohol, which revealed reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse reactions in the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use ashes or land.
Ash or earth can be more effective than pure water, but can be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, gray is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends gray and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct technique for hand washing recommended by the US Disease Control Centre to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or hot running water.
Current water is recommended as fixed sinks may be contaminated, while water temperature does not appear to be relevant.
Wipe your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when soap is used instead of pure water.
Refrain for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and rubs for a longer time removes more germs.
Swim well with running water.
Washing in a sink can contaminate hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, finger and under nails.
Artificial enamels and broken enamels can house microorganisms.
It is often recommended moisturizing lotion to maintain hydrated hands; dry skin may cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of infection transmission.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or cooking with appropriate holes and/or using gray if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted supply of water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "improvised towers" and other low-cost options.
An improvised tap is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a lever driven by the feet to clear a small amount of water in the hands and a soap bar.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to drying in public bathrooms.
An increasing volume of research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by the towel paper, hand dryers with hot air and the most modern hand dryers with jet air.
After washing and drying hands with hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers resulted in an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, 42% in the palm area close to the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying the hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was cross contamination potential between other users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which projects air outside the unit at specified speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and unit potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers were compared to drying with towel paper.
Washing hands with moistened hand wipers sheets is an alternative to lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand hygienicizers shall contain at least 60% alcohol.
The clinical washing of the hands became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
The clinical washing of the hands is for at least 15 seconds, using generous quantities of soap and water or gel to spray and rub all parts of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the interlacing of the fingers.
If there is waste under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents the recontamination of hands by these surfaces.
The objective of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germes") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that the proper washing of hands and other simple procedures may decrease the rate of infections in the bloodstream related to catheter by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the standard of hand washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The organization's hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate the hygiene of the hands if the demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicinal soaps or antimicrobials) confers an exterminating action on a hand washing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, some antiseptics of chlorhexidine or iodine, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other sterilized tools for cleaning under the nails.
All jewels should be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not slide into the hands.
After washing the hands is finished, the hands are dried with a sterilized towel and the surgical gown is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after you care for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand-cleaning in the first 20% wash, and an additional little significant benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing the hygiene of hands with an alcohol-based solution with the washing of hands with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each revealed that the wiper of hands based on alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand hygiene agents to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and difficult Clostridium spores in the hands. Interventions to increase the hygiene of hands in hospital environments may involve raising the awareness of the team about hand washing, increasing the availability of hand hygienicizers based on alcohol and verbal and written warnings to the team.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are more efficient in different health institutions.
In developing countries, the washing of hands with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for good health and better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable sources of water, soap or resources for hand washing in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the achievement of the universal practice of hand washing.
For example, in most rural Africa taps for hand-washing near any public or private bathrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for the construction of hand-washing stations.
However, low rates of hand washing may instead be the result of entrenched habits rather than the absence of soap and water.
Incentives and defenses of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of handwashing and cause a long-term change in behaviour of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand-washing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. One example for promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" which encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the top three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the promotional campaigns for hand washing carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The world day for handwashing is another example of awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronary virus pandemic, UNICEF announced the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALY classification.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting the washing of hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that the infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food origin and health-care-related infections led the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention to encourage more actively hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "adequate hand-washing techniques" were hung close to hands-washing feet in public bathrooms and bathrooms of offices and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands" means declaring the reluctance to assume responsibility or to be conjugated with something.
It originated from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a more general phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary spot, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after remembering or witnessing anti-ethical acts, tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and usually give more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleanness", such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of hands characteristic in many religions, including the Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, tevilah and the netilat yadayim in Judaism, the wash in Christianity, and the ablution in Islam. Religions also indicate the hygienic washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam allow the washing of hands after the use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islamism authorize the washing of hands before and after meals.
Hazard controls at the workplace for COVID-19
Hazard controls at work for COVID-19 are the application of health and safety methodologies at work for hazard controls for the prevention of coronary coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate hazard controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and on the work itself, based on the risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and on the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), less exposure-risk functions have minimal occupational contact with the public and other working colleagues, for which basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including hand-washing, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, maintain a respiratory label and routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Functions with medium exposure risk include those requiring frequent or direct contact with people on whom it is not known whether they are contaminated or suspected of COVID-19 contamination, but may be infected due to current Community transmission or having traveled abroad.
This includes workers who keep in touch with the general public as in schools, high-density working environments, and in the retail market of large volumes.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using high efficiency air filters, protective coverage and provision of individual protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers in the health system and necrosteries who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected VOCID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in people with confirmed VOCID-19 or suspected of generating aerosols and collect or handle specimens of these people.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic may have various effects on the workplace.
Workers may go away from work because they are sick, because they have to take care of other people or because they are afraid of a possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which products are on demand and of the means of purchasing these products (such as making purchases outside peak time or by delivery services or drive-thru.
Finally, sending items from areas seriously affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protection actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors of individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls needed to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparation for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a structure widely used in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 could not be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve the isolation of workers from work-related hazards without the behaviour of the worker, and may be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the policy or work procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of the hazard to the worker, adjusted properly as necessary (e.g. breathers), used properly and continuously, inspected regularly, preserved and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or discarded properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), low exposure work has minimal occupational contact with the public and other working colleagues.
Basic measures for the prevention of recommended infection for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous hand washing, incentives for workers to stay at home if they are sick and use the respiratory label, including covering the spire and cough, preparation of sheets and common garbage containers, preparation for telework or step shift, if necessary, disincentive of the use of other workers' tools and equipment, and maintenance of a routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCD) recommends that employees who experience symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they have no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or relieve other symptoms, and also recommends that disease licensing policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for a family member, and that they have knowledge of these policies.
According to OSHA, studies with average exposure risk include those requiring frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people on whom it is not known whether they are patients confirmed or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to the current community transmission in the company's locality, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with a high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact with the general public as in schools, high population density work environments, working environments, and some small retail retail stores of high volume sales volume sales sales. Engineering controls for this group and for higher risk groups include the installation of high-risk groups including the installation of high-efficiency air filters such as schools, high population density work environments, high population density work environments, high population density workplace environments, and some small retail retail shops and some high volume sales sales volume retail shops. Engineering controls for this group and for higher-risk groups include the installation of high-risk groups including the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase in ventilation, physical barriers, physical barriers installation, such as sanitary physical barriers such as toilets, clear plastics and transparent plastic travel facilities and transparent locations with COVID-19 COVID-19, the development of communications plans for this group and higher risk groups. Administrative training and updated training and instruction on risk factors and protection against COVID-19 COVID-19, the establishment and safety practices, the training of workers, the use of work staff who need to use jobs and protective equipment at places and protective, including safety, with instruction and protective, with instruction and safety, including instruction and safety, and safety management management management management management management management management, including, including, and use of, and use of use of use of use of use of use of use of use of use of, and use of use of use of use of, and use of use of use of, and use of, and use of use of, and use of use of use of, and use of use of the tools, and use of the environment, and use of, and use of use of use of use of the environment, and of, and use of use of use of use of the environment, and use of use of the use of the use of the use of use of the environment, including, including the use of equipment, including the use of the job, the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the job, and the use of the use of the job, the job, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the job, and the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the job, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the job, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the job, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the job, and the job, the job, the job, and the job, the job, the job, and the job, and the job, and the job, and the job, the job, the job, and the job, the job, and the job, and the job, and the job, and the job, and the job, and the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, the job, and the job, the job, and the job, the job, and the job, and the job, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the job, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the sick person from other people for a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer her a face mask, or ask the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with handkerchiefs while coughing or sneezing.
The crew should use disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items shall be disposed of in a bag for biological waste, and contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other vessels with passengers, hazard controls shall include deferral of the journey by the patient passenger, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if one presents fever or other symptoms during the trip.
The ideal is that medical follow-up occurs in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of trips in the field, assemblies, and other large groupings such as physical or coral education classes, or meals in a luncheon, increasing the space between tables, arrival times and more rigid departure, limitation of non-essential visitors, and use of a separate health care site for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, prolonged school exemptions can be considered. For law enforcement authorities carrying out daily activities, the risk to immediate health is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers contact individuals suspected of VOCID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medicine technicians, including the use of adequate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers must clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow the standard operational procedures for the containment and disposition of used PPE and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain workers in the area of health and necrosteries as being in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
High exposure functions include workers in the delivery of medicines, medical care, laboratories and medical transportation, which are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected CVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected VOCID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive specimen collection.
Work on high exposure necroteries includes workers involved with the preparation of bodies of people with confirmed VOCID-19 or suspected of the disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure to become very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected of the disease, including when aerosol generating procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure may be appropriate in some scenarios of necrosteries and in the area of health.
Specimens should be handled with caution on level 3 of biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated into two distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals who work at a distance of 6 feet of patients with confirmation or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, facial respirators with N95 particle filtration, approved by NIOSH or superior quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO only recommends a surgical mask for screening employees at the entry point.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with VOCID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, facial protective or protective glasses, surgical avental and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the overall supply of PPEs is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPEs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients to enter into a comfortable with a patient with COVID-19, using only the necessary PPE for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while dealing with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of PPE and disstimulating the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have in relation to each other.
Its challenges have no precedent, but we know that our best actions work together with global empathy, cooperation and community creation, which are the foundations of this organization.
Companionism and the concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, connections and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have all of you working colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their recognition for our work.
This person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol that this essential resource continues online and available to all.
The work of you makes this possible, as you keep active workplaces, pay our fellow workers and maintain the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
At that meeting, we consider what we believe to be an appropriate action to which we are experiencing and how best to maintain the sustainable organization in that period.
We want to end stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to stay away for a while, you have no problem.
For all employees, service providers and employees by contract:
our daily work expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise arranged.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you can work in normal hours, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy supplies or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule would not need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
You do not need to testify or pay leave. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that the key areas of work are attended.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that his sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention).
Staff who work per hour will receive full payment.
We have said that before, and we are committed to honoring our commitment to our contractors and employees who work for an hour.
They will all receive their salaries on the basis of their normal work file under normal circumstances.
Salaries are independent if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give you total support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask you to communicate to your manager, so we know what to expect and we can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to perform.
Sites, HR, Trusting and Security and Funding Engineering teams (among others) perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to do for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Deceleration now will not harm us in the future.
We have no intention of "working bent to recover lost time" after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new goals and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide a longer time for the budget, and that employees prioritize essential work, personal care and care for loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced journey in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues working in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
Given this situation, for caution, we employ an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the input bag and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is using its own care duties protocol using products that are safe for its customers.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and with all Washington employees.
Last week, our Washington office moved to a completely remote configuration, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing renting an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
Limit the duration of meetings for no more than one or two hours.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider dividing them in several days.
Define the meeting, have a schedule and forward material for reading in advance.
Use videos as default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real-time collaboration and connection.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone who monitors the questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make annotations (or collaborative annotations).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need comfortable earphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Participate in the #remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomic guides in the context of the webinar to assist in the increase of remote work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editing marathons, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We warned them that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions could prevent the completion of their agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying their goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness with paralysis, but also relief with clarity and ability to maintain focus in their own communities, in Wikimedia and in other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a Meta-Wiki page to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Maintaining up-to-date on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with employees.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with whatever we need.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other information related to COVID-19 in the company wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all information at a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in countries significantly affected today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else with which you may need help, keep notifying you and working with the communication resource team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, HR Global Operations Director.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that at present our work and obligations will probably need to be adapted in a way that we do not adapt to in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary as support right now, so that we can continue working, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months after.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of you and your family so that they are in their best condition when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resource team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the external surface (cell membranes) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestine cells.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of angiotensin-related converting enzyme (AEC) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), becoming a promising drug directed to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also acts as a point of entry into the cells for some coronaryviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
Type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc located on the endothelial surface and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an M2 N-terminal peptidesis domain and a C-terminal domain that carries amino acids and collectin in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single passage type 1 membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the domain of transmembrane by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released in the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cellular membrane of the main pulmonary alveolar cells of type II, enterocytes of the thin intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
The expression of the mRNA of ECA2 is also found in cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight for ECA.
The ECA cliques type I angiotensin hormone in type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
The ECA2 in turn cliques phenylalanine of carboxitermal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also cliques several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradykinine, aline, neurotensine, dinorphine A, and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the transport through the membrane of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the main entry point in cells for some coronoviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosoms located within the cells.
This process of entry also requires the preparation of protein S by the host serina-protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing the levels of ECA2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitor pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis review published on July 11, 2012 found that the "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
It is believed that recombinant human ECA2 (rhACE2) is a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seemed to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the 24-hour effects (duration).
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the inhibitors of the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where angiotensin II in circulation is high. Infused rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical tests for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Applications on COVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronovirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have contacted infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Various structures to create contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographic location of the application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to register user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, implemented an application that allows citizens to check if they were in contact with a person carrying COVID-19.
It is in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as open-source and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and offer a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government declared that the contact tracking application was in advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on the TraceTogether application of Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographical delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential absence of effectiveness if acceptance of the application is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the dissemination of fake or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple sets limits for types of organizations that can add coronavirus related applications to your App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronary virus applications, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronary virus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations have issued a communiqué asking for limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
data security and anonymity should be protected and presented as evidence-based protection;
digital surveillance should avoid worsening discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for in law;
safeguards against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse should exist;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health specialists and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporter without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating device systems when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a series of systems that preserve privacy were created to use central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application based system was used to run contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system gathered tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate text messages for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government also made localized information publicly available, which is permitted due to comprehensive changes in the information confidentiality laws after the emergence of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralized system.
By 6 April 2020 the details had not yet been disclosed.
Contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to, at least, 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups have worked on privacy-respecting solutions, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the proximity of one user to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinating effort that includes centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include Decentralized privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PCT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never comes out of the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during collection and use of path location or crossing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research from the technical publication "Applicatives play dirty: keeping personal privacy in an epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, an empress that develops privacy technologies and originally founded on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive data on location and health with other users and stakeholders, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that joined around what was essentially the same approach and largely with overlap protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the achievement of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government application, became open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed that they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system foresees implementation in three stages:
development of tools to enable the government to create official conavirus tracking applications preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to tackle persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system for systems upgrades in operation, and later removing it in the same way as soon as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug propagation, reperfilation, redistribution or therapeutic replacement) is the proposal of a drug approved for the treatment of a different medical condition or disease from that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research lines that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drugs, each with multiple connecting points.
Analyze these binding points provides the reasonable development project of effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the protease similar to papaine, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, protein S and ADP ribofosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that later improved and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a drug against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Como announced that the New York State chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine trials would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
The treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trials process and is only authorised by the EUA as experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when there's no other option.
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen demonstrated that favipyravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half was treated with favipyravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to base the medicine is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy Japan's medicine to store it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with CVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for Trump administration about buying the medicine. The medicine can be less effective in severe cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit the replication of HIV by connecting with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that connects to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to repropose specifically developed drugs for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international study Solidarity.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for the disease of the Ebola virus and infections by the Marburg virus. Gilead Sciences discovered after the rerdesivir presented in vitro antiviral activity against wire, pneumonia, paramix and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can cause more severe transmissions or diseases.
Some initial pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic resistance barrier. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for hospitalized and seriously ill people with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (in China and Canada), while the other one has no control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical test of Alvesco (cyclesonide) by Teijin, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The objective is the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is underway with 200 patients, to be recruited among the serious cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Currently, researchers from the Heart Institute in Canada are researching the role of colchicin in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammations in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over 40 years of age, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Women who are breast-feeding or do not use effective contraception were not included in the tests.
Several anticoagulants are in testing in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on use.
A multicenter study, with 300 patients, is analyzing the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses. The study was announced on April 14, Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable in order to give new purpose to approved and developed antiviral drugs for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics were identified as being able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receiver): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
Vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronovirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the clinical tests completed, there are several attempts in progress to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a virus that caused the disease, available in less than 18 months.
Five candidates for the vaccine were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a great spread of the outbreak in 2020, which led to considerable research investments and activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, stated in April that the needs for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, ECPI scientists reported 10 different technology platforms being researched and developing during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The targets of the largest platforms that have advanced to phase I security studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and candidate for vaccination: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and candidate for vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by ECPI scientists in April, a total of 115 candidates for vaccine are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to Milken Institute). 37 others were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being planned).
A phase I-II test performs safety testing and preliminary immunogenicity. It is typically randomised, placebo-controlled and multicentered, while at the same time determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease while monitoring adverse effects at the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccine (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 had not yet been evaluated in humans (they are still in preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular staple, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On 24 January 2020, in Canada, the Centre for International Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, announced the start of the work in a vaccine, with the objective of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Disease Prevention and Control Centre on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work for the development of a vaccine.

By March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the pre-clinical test and Phase I clinical studies in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The candidate for the vaccine is researched in the laboratory, with human tests planned for July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian stated that the President of the United States, Donald Trump offered CureVac "great sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under protest of the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop together a vaccine based on mRNA.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in preclinical testing, with clinical tests expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and its candidate for the final vaccine could start for human tests in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research consortium for the vaccine for COVID-19 involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 to 29 million dollars.
The other ECPI investment partners for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists began testing on animals of six different candidates for vaccine.
Imperial College researchers in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-ampplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate for the vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the sequencing of China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several candidates for vaccine in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vaccin bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other outbreaks of Coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "MNA delivered vaccines from the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 that triggered powerful responses of antibodies specific to antigens [in mouse] that were evident that started 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophagus, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A randomized posterior test in Australia is seeking to record 4,170 health workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens of animals specific to COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic rat, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates a need for containment measures for level 3 biosafety to manipulate live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in copies of non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARS that has been safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
From March 2020, there was a vaccine against MERS (DNA based) which concluded phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus vectord vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by several social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute Coronavirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The exposure time up to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
From 17 April 2020 more than 2,24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have already been cured. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through droplets produced by cough, spire or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when they expire, they usually fall to the ground or remain on surfaces rather than remain infectious in long distances.
People may also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although dissemination may be possible before symptoms appear and in subsequent stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by chain reaction of back-to-back transcription polymerase in real time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others require use.
Currently, there is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries by all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty staying awake, face or blue lips.
Less common, symptoms of upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, sliding nose or throat pain can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only breast tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease can evolve to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is normally six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The function that these asymptomatics perform in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Scarce and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Talking high releases more drops than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause the droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally transported by air, the National Academy of Science suggested that bioaerosol transmission can be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside the people's rooms contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted by the air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through the faeces, if it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, although it is not fully clear how easy the disease is to spread, a person normally infects one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in paperboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Products with soap degrade the lipid protective envelope of the virus, disabling it, as well as removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample presented the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day tested.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who had a relationship with a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely connected to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2), which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "pigula" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of infected people who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the receptors of ACE2 in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with ICU infections with COVID-19 and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to IOCID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells expressing ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammatory.
In particular, it was demonstrated that the pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF have a correlation with the recruitment of IL-6 secretory inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in necropsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or catarrh sample can be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, testing through antibodies (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not been widely used.
The experience of the Chinese with the test showed that their accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral dark multilobar glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic flooring (Lobular septos thickened with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available regarding microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisia, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASD) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukeroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with hands without washing.
The CDC recommends that you cover your mouth and nose with a coughing or sneezing canvas, as well as cover your mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the sheet is not available.
The appropriate hygiene of the hand after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public meetings.
The distance guidelines also include that people stay at least 1.8 meters (6 feet) away from each other.
An effective medicine is not known for the prevention of COVID-19. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to decrease the peak of the epidemic, also known as "purchasing the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after rubbing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using antiseptic for hands based alcohol with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where antiseptics for commercial hands are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity occurs through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand aseptics".
Glycerol is added as humidifying.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect that they are with the virus use a simple facial mask.
The oxygenation of the extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those people with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive doctors and pneumologists from the U.S.A. have gathered recommendations for the treatment of various agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution is needed to minimize the risks of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being performed that can generate aerosols such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals taking care of people with CVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with isolation of airborne infections (SIIA) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blanket, breathing or facial mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of facial masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorised the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure at two levels.
If either of them brings the same benefits to people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits that aerosol particles spread, when compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60 years and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have per capita hospital beds in sufficient amount, which limits the ability of the health system to deal with sudden escalation in the number of severe COVID-19 cases enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDR) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators that have pressure control mode and high PEEP level are required to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pulmonary lesions and pneumothorax associated with ventilation.
High PEEP level may not be available in older fans.
Potential treatment research started in January 2020 and clinical tests are being performed with several antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are in the advanced phase of testing.
Antiviral medicine can be tested in people with various diseases.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the tests of effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA gave temporary authorisation for plasma use of convalescent people as treatment in cases where the person’s life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies needed to show their safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been performed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
It is requested that users report their name and ID number.
The application can detect the "near contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Big data analysis of cellular data, facial recognition technology, mobile telephony tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorised security agencies to track mobile telephone data of persons who are supposedly with coronary viruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and to protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate telephone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to research and prevent transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect who's missing quarantine.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was informed by cell operators that "40% of people continue to circulate anyway".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackaton at the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian president Kersti Kaljulaid made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said: "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a mild evolution, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but lack data from COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospital admissions with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median manifestation of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with exudates cell fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Vial cytopathic alterations were observed in the pneumocytes.
The imaging examination of the lung looked like acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of the hospitalized had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates by comorbidity vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The underreporting of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or to die than non-smokers. Concerns were raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authority found a 20% to 30% fall in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated organ damage.
This may also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases were reported in which the recovery of COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronaviruses at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin, by means of transhipment infection.
The real origin is unknown, but since December 2019 the spread of infection has become almost entirely driven by human transmission to humans.
A study with the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 at The Lancet, revealed that the oldest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of the onset of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in laboratory and U07.2 for deaths due to VOC-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the fatality rate per case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the lethality rate for infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not restricted to time and accompany a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 should have been formally recorded as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0,004% of the population) had death by COVID-19 confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in the 50-year range, with the difference between men and women only approaching 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, lower prevalence of smoking women and the development by men of comorbidities as hypertension at a lower age than women may have contributed to the higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women of different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is of "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", disease and "19" is since the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g.: China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatizations. The virus that causes COVID-19 was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus" of Wuhan.
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV" as interim names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 guidance against the use of sites in names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal zaragots and respiratory parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the necessary schedule, a local startup did reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves from one day to the next.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories emerged, incorrect information and misinformation about the origin, dimension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine was approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization began the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV are being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the integral virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection of COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research concentrates on the protein of the sperm that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibodies-dependent improvement was pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 clinical trials have been underway since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs consists of most Chinese research, with nine clinical tests in phase III of remdesivir in several countries due to an end-April report.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of candidates for medicine and vaccine for COVID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicinal products are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is an attempt to prove the efficacy of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with rembesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical tests are being performed in the USA, China and Italy. The chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for a joint review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to the criteria of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be more studied in vivo after demonstrating low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the protein of the initial spicule in preparation for serum 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antitempest properties of cytokine. Tocilzumabe was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after completion of a small study.
A non-randomized test is underway in phase 2 of the national level in Italy, after having demonstrated positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of the death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of cytokine release syndrome refractory to steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumabe is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, e.g. using monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are developing.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus disorders, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
