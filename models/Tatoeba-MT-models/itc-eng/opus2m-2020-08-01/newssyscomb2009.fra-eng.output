Victory of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought about a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current major coalition, as well as a well-known strengthening of populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffers from particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return on the political scene at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent lost almost nine percent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parties of the post-war period; especially for the people's party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
But the voters punished them visibly for letting the government collapse.
From the initial reactions to the results, speculations regarding the possible resignation of the party leader and current vice-cancer Wilhelm Molterer were expressed.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the Extraordinary Party Management Board.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the way out of the outcome of the election that remains most likely, namely the renewal of the major SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, in view of the strengthening of the two populist parties on the right - the free parties (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - the socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated) on a common government, which even brought about sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he planned to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently put on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament is the Greens, but they have slightly lost and have fallen back, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in fifth position.
Obviously, no other party exceeds the limit of four percent and does not access parliament.
Schwarzenberg: The relationship with India is likely to cool down
If the problem concerning Czech researchers accused in India of illegal pickup of cafards was not resolved, the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg would follow a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister declared it today in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, following a Czech initiative.
Mr. Mukherjee said, in making talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged of the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, Darjeling, with the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the local government.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could apply for bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner expresses himself in the same sense also during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be free," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"We wish above all to keep everything with India the best relationships, which have a tradition continuing over many years.
The Indians also recognize him," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers to be a great disgrace," he said.
The Minister avoids the question if he has obtained from India the promise to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he says.
A Czech Arbitrary Fight for the Seabed
It is approaching a wall electronic card, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
He is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is still as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its chief, the director of the division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, followed the presentation and completion of the division from time to time.
Adoration at work and enthusiasm characterize the reigning atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known so far, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms for the moment unknown, which can contain the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A larger fund than the land
The coastal states have now begun to aspire vehemently to the new submarine territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they used their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called continental Shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental Shelf.
"To simplify, continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its basement, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred sea miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic one," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned submit to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental Shelf should be supported by broad scientific-technical documentation, based on many expensive prospections and metrosis.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently experienced a global decline.
New Zealand, too, has won the territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission allocated to it last week, represents 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in prospections.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will be, as they project, invaluable.
Other countries will progressively submit their request.
They can do so within ten years after ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the ocean floor area, proclaimed by the "common heritage of humanity" convention.
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"However, we are not mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, stating that "these areas are clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern countries within the framework of the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of the one referred to as "a pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area covered by the investor is slightly more than the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is enlivened, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic realizations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," he named Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a realization.
She recalls a small apple of land, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German special forces were on site for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had sought Germany's assistance in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but never turned to action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists removed from Egypt are revealed.
According to instructions from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 staff members from the federal police and the federal criminal police office, as well as logistics experts from Technischen Hilfwerk, were at the scene of release.
As the Ministry spokesperson communicated to him on Monday evening, German forces were not finally required, hostage takers who had released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it into the support force.
"This was fortunately not so far," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of the Federal Interior.
The attackers had removed the group of tourists of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt.
After their removal into the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostage takers has remained vague so far, as well as the details of release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have meanwhile arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the hostages released were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information has been provided on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and the special forces should have taken off on board an Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives denies the rescue plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress recently failed the $700 billion heavy financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones grazed in the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the United States House rejected the rescue plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and political men at the head of the two parties, the program that had to play the chaos of financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the partisans desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded 700 billion dollars of this heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called on Members to vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan might captivate.
It goes back shortly before the end of the vote, and then after the announcement of failure, it falls again.
Experts are now designing new serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, approval and the Chamber of Deputies and Senate are necessary.
Organizers report a growing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the next few months according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak cyclical prospects, German travel thirst remains unsatisfied according to this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period in the previous year, as was entrusted to Berlin by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing numbers of bookings are already controlling the fall months.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, the RVD was entrusted.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar price, travel to the USA would be particularly requested, the DVD said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about one Third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece and our territory would be destinations particularly sought by the Germans.
Specially organized travel is very requested, the president of DRV Klaus Laepple explained.
In view of rising energy and food prices, costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individual trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with reductions in advance bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Summer months were also very much retained so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
Ballermann or Abres-Ski hits continuously, beer in beers and celebrities in tyrolian costumes to design.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we don't actually have much in common.
She is blond, TV animator and wears a tailor-made tyrolian costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is an occasion.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
This is how we become friends.
The cheap Tyrolian costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist of the beer party and normally living in the northern part of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on the Thérèse square, everything is half less worse.
Everyone or almost wears a tyrolian costume or leather pants; no one looks blasphemous or shame-affected - it's completely normal.
Only the board of my Tyrolian costume picks up some weird eyelashes at the bar of the choco bananas.
A Bavarian woman pointed out that I would have misattached my board: "to the left means free, to the virgin middle, to the broken right, to the widow's rear."
Discreetly, I trip my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she tells me.
Others do not give themselves so much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and carry simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their naked rear-train without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He finds this "gorgeous" with an "oooo" lying down.
He told me all about it after he got rid of the chop he had drunk before.
Right next to this burning mouth that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild pissers."
Others don't have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers run on the party square and must take care of the poor drinkers.
Rather, the nurses intervene in mutandis - always by four, they drag their tent-covered nurse into tents.
It works like this for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we get full of it.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunks under the bench are not visible.
"Those who can no longer swallow anything," cried one of the rescuers in answer to my question and then disappeared into the mixture.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the crash Friday afternoon in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he was suspected of dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, on bail.
Turkey broadens its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey planned to join the European Union, the European Powers were looking forward to entering its back country.
On the east side of the Bosphore, 20 steps away from Asia is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is set on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, with observation towers at each of its angles, such as some German provincial mayors.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is ruined.
But once inside the vaulted ticketery, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a late game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its Arab irregulars.
The isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the ice borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the forces of the Empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the German Turks and their allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a munitions train exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources state that this is sabotage.
Since then, it has fallen slowly to ruin, swallowed up in the middle of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolie and all the eastern points, serves at least symbolically, to highlight the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The isolation of its region around, generated by the ice borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a car-bed in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turkish Suât Kinikioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour trip, rocked on noisy rails whose cadence recalled the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning back to his German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and many pastries in which middle managers in men and women-cravate costumes meet for morning business.
Suat Kinikioglu could have been a right-centre politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she must look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"But, here's what at some point, "I asked if" should Turkey not choose?"
"Turkey" said he didn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then highlighted one aspect that almost all those with whom I could speak, have said to me by heart: The Turkish railway not only goes towards the Middle East, but also towards the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, is therefore both an advantage for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe that travels metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I repainted these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could largely be in Turkey's hands.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I was reminded of the period when Turkey had been called "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical Director at Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (died September 11th) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already starting his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include those under 21 years, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old- refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music was presented to him, whether he was madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and that thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which has remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod told us "let music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there in the music.
So sing!"
Its ringage technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or visible.
Whatever the musical standard was, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be appointed as a knight, it's good Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the 1962 to 1982 decades when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me and, sometimes, they have even inspired me.
Todd Handley had such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focused only on certain people".
He'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurology of William Woodruff (died September 25th) states that "in 1946, he resumed his studies in economic history, Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was conducting a BSc, MA and PhD."
This is from Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time he finished a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at universities in Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to conceal this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "the Flamenco and life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys many feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda's super sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new volume has an even wider interior space.
In addition to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
So it's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this volume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation was placed on the market.
First of all, Honda has renovated this model within a shorter period than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Specifically in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with about a million cars sold in six years represents is second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow her to increase her sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thought selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002 which represents 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish branch is looking forward to selling 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to make much of the drop in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the trade mark expects to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars in less than in 2007, a 16% decrease in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese trade mark also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year around the world.
Depending on the markets and estimated by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is planned during the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimeters plus), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters plus) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change 1.52 meters.
Dimensions increase and interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the safe - which has a double-back system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity plus the first generation box.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the box of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors providing access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz which would open with an angle of 67 degrees.
Engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two fuel propellers of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases the engine speed.
The first 1,2 liter engine develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tr/min and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 tr/min.
This propeller - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres to 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which over the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This 100 horse Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The 'bee car' that prevents collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
His name is Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have made this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Trademark Management, BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Safety Shield.
This robot will allow vehicles of the brand to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee created its own personal space in an oval shape that resembles a lot of Nissan safety shield.
But most important are the eyes made up of the bee, capable of seeing in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to steal without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects the obstacles that are located on a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"At the time he detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurking its wheels of 90 degrees or more to avoid the collision.
The greatest difference compared to any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
If that was the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Displacement Laboratory and major engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second this device must only process information and act according to these data.
It does not need to retain information or intuitive logics of prior maneuvers, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about giga-bytes of memory, not even megabytes."
This represents the first reason for the development of new technologies for instantaneous collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into serial cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot runs with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ions batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding roadblocks.
They're afraid to be mortgaged
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not without genius.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say 'the hotel of bad credit' ... or stories.
The disturbing aspect of this accommodation and especially the Master of the Hotel leads us to think several times if this is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is certain that this game provides useful but not detailed information.
It's more like a teenage game.
What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens his capital in MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to his round table of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will pay $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp drop in its scholarship course.
One week after an interim agreement was issued, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of regular shares Morgan Stanley at the unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley indicated that the overall transaction would take place on the basis of an average unit price of $29, 28% above its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 5:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained John Mack, U.S. CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but to pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares in Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, he explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, that participation would consist entirely of regular actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert within one year half of its preferred shares into regular shares if more than 50 per cent are traded over the conversion price, or approximately $47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should display a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan pointed out that he has "clearly" reduced his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been difficult for the group, which has seen its scholarship course melt by half while the cost of insurance against a risk of default on its debt flow.
This cost declined on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's large investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's repurchase, announced that they had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffettt's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
To consolidate the republic around the socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like its counterparts and friends, it was the third that put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results of 80% of votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory of the "yes", located between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed in an overwhelming way," he assured Ecuadorians at Guayaquil governorate headquarters, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in calm according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution devotes the State's power over the economy, reserving to it the "planning of development" of a country that lives essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currencies that send its emigrants.
Correa, elected in 2006, also gives strengthened powers to the head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and fight a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in that country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the bullies of the eleven tourists and their eight accompanied men captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday afternoon, healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived around 15:30 on board a special plane at the military base of al-Maza, docked at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the hospital of Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the raiders," said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garana on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 in a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one cache to another by 35 unknown raiders.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer reported that 30 members of the Special Forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault on the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of shots occurred, and half of the bullies were killed, the others fleeing," said the manager who demanded anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the lightning unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commanders.
The Italian diplomat Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The previous day, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the raiders were on, killing in six, including the Chadian chief, and stopping two.
The army had stated that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is held on the headlines and this election campaign is held.
So much better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the misery of small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government dedicate three and a half million euros to the restoration of Chinon's only castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving three under private archival monceaux and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When is a forum for history and heritage?
The Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states assist the Belgian-Hollandian bank, as the first European banking institution in a situation of distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it. The three countries support this financial and insurance institution with interest in Hungary as high as 11.2 billion euros.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the competition officer of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been widening for more than a year is for the Fortis bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy nearly half (up to 49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell some of its shares, including, first of all, the activities, essentially insurance, which it acquired last year of the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis actions started a vertiginous fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let her go to bankruptcy.
Only Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of shares, the total value of the group's capital revolves around €14 billion, which, according to society's leaders, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of outside the Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, of being the cause of the fall of the Fortis actions.
On Monday, papers have already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank as the new Director General.
The financial body also sought private buyers, but has not yet received any substantive proposal.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's customer circle and no agency was assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information on their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of information on the prescription of medicinal products, in any case, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it would be worth assigning his chicken to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the program creator used to manage drug requirements in Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on insurance premiums and insured capital in the event of damage, on the health status of the client present, and if they feel that the risk is too high, they don't even ensure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after having learned of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, he provides himself easily with pharmacies, data on the purchase of the person's medication in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines himself, what illness the person is suffering and what state of health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high rate of fat in the blood, which immediately puts him into a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk factor, so there is no longer much left to do to the insurer except the paperwork. However, minor problems may still arise.
Among the disadvantages of this program are the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flushes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data, and they must request permission from the patient before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
They are then forced by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their past failings.
In recent years, some companies have also been dealing with laboratory analysis results, linking them with data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of use becomes increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a bill on the extension of the control circle of the authorities concerning companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his programme, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her agreement, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance agreement with him or her.
So and ultimately, chickens depend on the kindness of the fox.
The global menu in Marseille
The European Union and India are expanding by two trades.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit where there will be a major issue of atomic energy cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is a great emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi for its permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
They were not too late on this issue yesterday at this 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they were going to multiply by two trades, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not appear to be too ambitious.
In this respect, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, so that air trade can also expand in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to accelerate negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with one side, India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgent need for a United Nations conference on this issue was mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been requested, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU confirmed its loyalty to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the fact that a global market would be needed at the next year's climate conference, and that greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Chief of State of India today goes to the French capital, where, at a bilateral meeting, he prepares to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the news agency's information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 nautical exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 thousand exhibit titles, and Turkey as an honored guest.
He will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy- 264 square metres of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in the Room Struktur, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books gradually decreases compared to the total Italian production, and in particular to that of adults and children.
Found Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset's plane wreckage, the billionaire that disappeared on September 3, 2007 while he was flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3000 metres high, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammont Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County's sheriff, John Anderson, has overcome the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is the one that Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surroundings.
In February the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead .
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreck was detected, a team of investigators sent to the premises identified the aircraft: it was Bellanca 8kcab, missing on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their home at Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, species money and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
In the sixth attempt, in 2002, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he had turned the world around by plane and without a stopover.
Of all these records, also the one to have stolen at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you're not waiting for.
A 4x4 out of the common of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, with wide surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the off road "compact" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this area.
Just by its unstandard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom, from October 17th.
Thus the advertising beating that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented communication modality, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan's shopping, Corso Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost actual size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the display.
Then, through the use of innovative Remove8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated by spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes tries to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of motor communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see it well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy has been ashamed of now? They are members of the " Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and who, up to now, has never created major problems.
He never had a fight with the opposing typhosis.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (a little in reality) of Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolored flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday evening, they were all removed for not being identified.
They're inspired by the English typhoon.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhoon of real Nazis, that of Levski.
Figc had made available Italian typhosis, 144 tickets for the party: all nominatives, and therefore easily controlled.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: none of those who left for Sofia had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stage.
Four Italian typhosis who had a history of stadium crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal expects to read the acts that will happen from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, typhosis arrested or identified in the messes may purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo which prohibits the attendance of Italian and European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans won't step into the stadium anymore.
Well, fortunately.
But now is the time for fear-emotion: that is, others are likely to add to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," says Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Chickens there is indeed a small core of supports of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday, the Casms, which can even count on a section of Asia, that is, secret services, which deal precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here is Domenico Mazzilli's opinion (expressed in a very unfavorable way) recently, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly prefect in Trieste where it resides a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that renting Mussolini in Bulgaria is not a crime, but it is certain that the conduct of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - add the No. 1 of the Observatory - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the event occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will assess for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles to Mameli's anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not police..."
