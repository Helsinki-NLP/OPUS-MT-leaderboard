UN Chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN head again called on all parties, including the UN Security Council divided to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he intends to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries in the Council - the USA, Russia, China, England and France - on the margins of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed his regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unresolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 figures from polls showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to drop Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it didn't work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed that Donald Trump is driving with a percentage of two figures and some voices are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the chances of naming the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the nomination of Republicans.
Pundits shows that during the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance was taking place to Herman Cain in polls, but none of them won in any state in the nominating race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard at the general elections are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super CAP and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Here are a few figures from recent polls that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just passing by:
The figures indicating support for Trump returned 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 says they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump would win the race for nomination.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiasm" or "thank you" if Trump would win the race for nomination.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "uprooted" if Trump would win the race for nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% says it would be "enthusiasm" compared to 40% that says the same thing about Trump).
Closest with regard to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they would be "disgruntled" or "sigh" if Jeb Bush's favorite wins the race for nomination.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for the insults brought and his bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters at national level consider that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the poll conducted on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in Iowa State, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe that he does not have the necessary personality to act effectively and nearly six out of 10 independents claim that his temperament does not have what he is looking for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe Trump is authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, on the question who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed against the end of July, when four out of 10 would bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
During the same period of the last election, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or replicated to another candidate, Trump is still at the head of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while supporting Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted at the beginning of September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is located 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, at 14 points from Marco Rubio, at 15 points from Walker, at 19 points from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who wins him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a one-to-one hypothetical confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Of course, much can happen in this regard and no one can say that these will never change their mind.
46% claim that they leave the door open to change their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently the Ben Carson neurosurgeon, but it's twice as likely as voters who say they've decided to vote with Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say I agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump appointed immigrants from Mexico "violators" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration was the central subject in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bomb style will lead to a breakdown between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will damage the rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post poll, six of the 10 Republicans claim that they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, as long as the immigration problem remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration against authorities reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the poll conducted on Monday by ABC/Post, six of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone experienced in government.
People are also angry at the Washington authorities.
A survey carried out two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans in Congres, 54% declaring themselves "unthankful" and 21% "buzzy".
Jeremy Corbyn takes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be analysed closely by the media and labor parliamentarians.
During his weekly appearances, he called for “less theatre and more facts.”
He also said that he could give up several participations and give them up to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in leadership position, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after the speech he held on Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Party leader to remain silent at the national anthem in a job held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted criticism from conservative parliamentarians and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he "held silence in a respectful manner" and recognized "the heroism of British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of the ghost cabinet of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, said for the Two's Newsnight broadcast transmitted by the BBC that the Labour leader would be advised to sing the national anthem "individual" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing by differences of opinion related to economics, defence and externals, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant states that the political differences "cumulate" in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbyn's appointment on his position against the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would eliminate the whole idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "cap" level from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Leader to face David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas from “outside sources” for questions to Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North said that PMQs involve a level of confrontation too high and will refrain from repetitions and attacks, engaging in instead focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take his place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the opportunity to speak, saying that he had approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" associated often with PMQs, but admitted a few years later that he failed in his quest.
Since the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, of the way it leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although criticisms claim to become a caricature and requires profound reform.
« Framework in Joburg »: Young homeless people benefit from photo courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and win their life.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young people without shelter to take pictures of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage enlargement
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, said that an increase in the minimum wage in Britain could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, that purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs within the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the "fortuna" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves rather words of praise and not criticism, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged unwelcomely into the light of reflectors by the scandalous raid Kyrgios had against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters Tournament.
In a qualifier match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to break up Kokkiakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios down, and I should have put this kid down."
Although he was last seen making a dust rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open Tournament, angry with Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The adolescent is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the second place individually, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal Davis Cup against England.
“One thing I feel strong about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted to a little conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration against himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of that.
But to be serious, he's been extremely good at quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man who works hard and has joined the team, had no kind of conflict with the other players, he is very respected at the dressing room, he is training himself hard, he is in an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and defects.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important kickback game, which begins on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most suitable for all, but supported the return of the player from Canberra in the long-term team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the game and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he matured under the eyes of the public and made some terrible mistakes and deserved to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time when he's not in the center of attention to be able to reflect, good for both the team and him.
Elections 2016: The advantage of Hillary Clinton in front of Bernie Sanders has been halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins land.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democratic voters (down 58%), while Sanders is in second place, 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced if he is to run for the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they're going to support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than other candidates.
Faced with the CBS poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percentages.
Clinton retains the advantage between women and moderators, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support for men has been considerably reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now being equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still ahead of the old voters.
Last month, Clinton stood in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among the liberals, but Sanders now has an easy advantage of five points in this group.
About half of the democratic voters at the national level say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps surprising, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be excited about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who don't currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of democratic voters say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the number of Republican voters who declare the same thing about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why they would want her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
Given that the vice-president is considering a possible candidacy for the presidency, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him running - although a third of them think they should not run.
On the question of the second option for the party's representative, democratic voters call Biden the majority.
Among Clinton's supporters, over half said Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic party race, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden running to 30 points if it does not run.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton the most likely candidate to win the general elections; but the figures have fallen from 78% last month.
Biden is far away, but the percentage according to which he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Just like last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as party representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well with regard to some key features of their party’s primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and confidence and strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen among all three as regards integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrity and trust, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% don't think about him in this regard.
Democratic voters generally also consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
Regarding all these aspects, about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have a view about Sanders.
How do questions remain regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was Secretary of State, most democratic voters are pleased with his explanation on the subject and say that he did not affect their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject, shortly after the issue came out.
Most Americans say that this email-related controversy has not affected their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% says they have changed their opinion in a negative way.
Most Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they've changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton an integral and reliable one, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at general level: only 32% considers it integrity and trust, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in more.
62% of voters do not consider it integrity and trust.
At the same time, 55% of national voters do not consider Trump to be fully trusted and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank the first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integral is greater than those who do not feel the same, however, as in Carson’s case, many do not.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brother charged for the murder of the student in year 1 of Baruch's College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during a initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternal at Baruch University in New York brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during a initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed him to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim was tied to the eye, put behind him a 14-kg sack full of sand and was repeatedly sudden while trying to move towards a target on an ice-cold ground.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches and then lost consciousness.
The Pi Delta Psi brothers didn't call the emergency number after he passed out and claiming he'd wait an hour before he took him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they found the time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the fraternity at the national level, to ask for advice, the chief of police, Chris Wagner, told a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal goods and put practically the good of the brotherhood before the good of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head trauma, trunks and thighs.
“Many families were devastated by fraternal rituals, since 1970 at least one student lost his life every year because of the rituals,” Douglas Fierberg, Deng’s family lawyer, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Greater Monroe District Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with murder of grade three.
Another thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with outrage and crime.
"We want to take responsibility not only for those involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also take responsibility," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Faculty of Baruch prohibited the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its membership with the local representation.
Here's what happens when the Federal Reserve increases interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (the growing market) will change, the profitability of the bonds will increase and the economy will enter into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In the economy, history offers little clues to time frame.
After the first increase in interest rate, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, U.S. central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on the moment they begin to increase interest rate but on the trajectory of the time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in the game.
In the end, however, market players could see that all the turmoil related to interest rate growth has been overstated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the “cheap money” era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Economics Capital, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that all seem to fear.
But it can't be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how some sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the market situation in recent months, anticipation of interest rate growth can evaluate things for a while.
But at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which reflects may again the breakdown of monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after Fed growth.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has increased sharply - with approximately 14 percent - towards the growth of interest rate, quite invariable in the period of 250 days after (averagely 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the chief strategy of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said that the impact on actions tends to become later pronounced in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits begin to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life but the increase in interest rate often contributes to it.
In the present situation, Fed faces conditions that have not existed before and which could accelerate a recession.
More precisely, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in the interest rate Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 increase in interest rate after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was lower than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have prepared themselves all year round for a growth decision by Fed, all eyes being focused on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economists believe that the WTO could approve an increase in interest rate at this meeting, the future transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study after 1950, all cycles of interest rate growth have so far been in a super profit growth cycle, GDP eclipsed peaks before the recession very quickly after recovery," the report said.
On the other hand, this was a strange slow recovery after the most severe recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by Fed at the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months old, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on bonds than on actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, benefits appear to change direction as soon as the first cycle growth/fall occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the profitability of the bonds immediately declines," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies believe that these interest rate increases will lead to the approximation of the profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-cost bonds are better off in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing profitability," said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"Aside from the strength of the dollar and the decrease in the estimated inflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profitability curve is fairer, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed pursues politics.
In large lines, companies operating their majority in the United States will have to win as a result of rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to the depreciation of their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to be more profitable within three months of an initial increase in interest rate," said analyst Goldman Sachs in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balances exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital revenues as well as low volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Duty will become an important issue.
Companies with a high share of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also gain from the increase in the dollar.
Those who save might also have won, although experts do not agree on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, says Parliamentary Andrew Bingham
Conservative Parliamenter Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for "prospering"
It claims to be increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took to the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized Brits prizes
Col Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that neither this show is original
BBC Radio 3 is "transformed into" Classic FM, said an important parliamenter, putting pressure on the post to prove that he does something that commercial posts do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public radio station "prostes" and is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 "prostes" - although I don't like using the word - but I have the impression that it turns into Classic FM," he said.
He also took the BBC Music Awards, released last December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Britts under another name.
So, if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that do only copy what already exists on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent regarding live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anywhere about classical music that I know about Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I believe it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new pieces," he said.
In the first part of this year, editor BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said he needed to make more efforts to attract the audience from the previous period because the British have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC label criticised during the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee because it would follow its commercial rivals.
Conservative Parliamenter Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's talent show from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and it is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be held "in a specific BBC manner."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find the golden egg chicken in its own degree" next time he launched a entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban future taking of new seasons from The Voice or spending money going on licenses on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales have recorded the lowest growth in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The latest month has seen the slowest growth from 2000 to the present.
Online sales took forward three years ago due to the use of the mobile phone to do shopping.
Specialists are of the opinion that the Black Friday of November could result in reluctance to spend.
Over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned the commercial streets of Britain into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are signs that online sales are declining, the latest figures showing a rise of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total of the money spent in August showed the lowest growth from 2000 to now, with a growth of only 5% in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are declining, the latest figures showing a rise of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the growth level of the previous years and return until 2000, there has always been a rationalized trend in time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index for Guardian.
He explained that online sales took forward three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's stagnating a little, you might notice a decrease (of growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event taking place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers froze in front of computers to put their hands on the offers, which led to the collapse of several retail sites.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers have beaten chilipires, could result in the reluctance of buyers.
A study published by British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 out of every £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy online clothes and shoes than to appeal to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the sanctioning of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed after the massacre in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on Muslim streets, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly blamed the giant in Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
Health Minister said a total of 394 people were injured following macaral collapse.
In the street-walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macaret collapsed at the Mecca mosque.
Dressed in white, the mourners joined the road to express condolences until the first death reached the end of the final journey at the Al-Moassem cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where only a few days ago a building crane collapsed through the mosque ceiling, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the construction group of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also fought with 394 wounded.
At the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macaw collapsed at the Mecca mosque.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pilgrimage when the macara collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Great Moschee with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still reaching the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the upper jaw when the crane was not in operation.
A Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group partly bears the blame for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not present that detail, but said the company leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macarals to collapse in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the macaral collapse and the Group representatives could not be contacted for the declarations.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and did not coordinate its activity with the meteorological authorities.
Tens of cranes surround the Mecca Moschee Sea, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is carrying out major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renowned son" from the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to take part in pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of each Muslim physical fit.
Authorities say 158 people stay in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased victims would receive one million Saudi Rials (174,000 pounds) and the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of converting credits to Swiss francs
Two bids have already appeared on the banking market to convert loans into Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
The disadvantages can come over a few years, when variable interest can lead to increasing rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting credits into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the offer of conversion for its own customers.
According to data compiled by financial portal analysts FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest to lei, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the offer of conversion of the Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of credit clients in francs due to the second successive reductions: the balance was reduced with the value of risk commissions and customer-paid administration, then an additional reduction of 22.5% to the lei balance was applied.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the monthly rate equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Transylvania Bank reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and theoretically by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the collection of credits in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from the future increases of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which the salary is paid.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no re-evaluation of the property, no further guarantees and no further proof of income are required.
In practical terms, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and no additional costs as in the case of a refiner.
Both banks also offer a discount to the monthly rate, compared to what they would pay customers before conversion, equivalent to lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is more formed of the interest, and the client repays very little of the main.
Bancpost's offer with very little interest in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
It is not known how this will develop after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest rates is that ROBOR indices will grow significantly in the following years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR three months ago is 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to cover other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks at the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether or not to increase interest rates for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, a little over half last week believed that the decision would be taken, I think now that the situation will be maintained for a while and that interest rates will be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation in which a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, recovery bringing billions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
See who lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has experienced stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in the face of cancer.
It is also reported that the actor would have faced the issue of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly has a cost.
Player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is on the bar for a few months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture on his right foot in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of the Eindhoven PSV.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following an unexpected intervention by Héctor Moreno in minute 15, after Shaw, aged 20, broke up the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then he'll be operated in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, has difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something like this happens.
He's got his oxygen mask in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but in the double fracture the break is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Looks like Moreno got lucky and got rid of the red cardon and the concession of a penalty hit.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say it's fault and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for messages, I don't have words to express how weak I feel, starting my way back to recovery, I'll get stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit Luke Shaw's accident in defeating PSV
The foundation of the team of England has another reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very bad accident.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never seek to harm an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg by playing for Mexico's national against the Dutch Nationals led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
“It’s very hard because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it’s a very serious accident, it’s not right,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I couldn't see but the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In his SBS6 statement, Moreno said: “I know how difficult it is to get through this.
I feel so bad. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission but still hold tight
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repetition of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate any choice of a winner on the move.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the spin in the beating line and collective morals is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a youthful positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as spinner and Adil Rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left England's team for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his chief coach in Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to analyze my decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven games test against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no sign of questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said before - the players are their own selections.
Some fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny lies in his hands.
I hope that if he does more running for Yorkshire, he'll have other opportunities.
The main coach of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance wasn't on his own ability and it doesn't surprise me; first of all, he's a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noted in the test matches.
Lyth had seven rounds -- like Sam Robson before him -- while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got lucky at home and on the way.
The only disappointment you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in the best shape - but that missed occasion is in the past.
The team's coming Alex Hales, a batsman I count very well.
He's a cricket player who has "X factor" and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a pitch Trent Bridge.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea was launched for Moeen to open up to the fight with Cook, which would lead extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a thrower couldn't hit there and this left player has already shown he's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was number three for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38-game test 38 as first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team on the back-up spinner job and, although I had limited contact with him, it struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his age from age -- with an average of 31 at the beating and 35 at the ball -- and they might think it's a point, but there's not a lot of spinners and the selectioners chose for the youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has brought some changes to the team of coaches.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, batsman from Sri Lanka, as consultant for the test matches could be a master shot.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he has played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the tournament's white-ball league and will bring both energy and unbridled ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they send messages that have been transmitted and before, they can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes rests for one day's matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although they do not all agree, trainers and selectioners do not make the programme.
And you have to hold, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
Brexit camp could have a cause if the economy is kept in calm by 2017
The next day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse, even without the brilliant "Yes or no" election of Jeremy Corbyn to the Labour Party or TUC lead brings serious criticisms to Europe on Tuesday.
The strangers also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the past few days that - plunged into crises similar to that of the EU - not all being caused internally - some Member States are fed to the Great British agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they didn't want this either if they would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor take part in bilateral meetings or meetings in foreign capital, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with a perspective outside under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that many ministers and officials from certain capitals have come to the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor extremely cautious, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wishes to leave the position before her situation crumbles, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English people who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - a thing they don’t want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers could even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegotiation has been fixed" and "The Great Britain has obtained no value from the renegotiation".
Europeans know on their skin how catchers Fleet Street can be and how skeptic are the barons of the oligarchic press that regard the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry into report 2:1.
I may recall the vagueness of Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was corresponding to Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax payers, foreigners who cheated phone and pseudo non-domestics who hold most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him a postcard.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me back Monday at Westminster -- I told him not to spend his time with me -- he seems to be in danger of adopting from Neil Kinnock's strategy of boycotting from the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may last, but it must develop a coherent strategy of media cooperation, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at BBC left her vacation on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call evolution with indulgence.
It states that it would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative "english" might agree with that.
That's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and TV this week, when the researcher in him fought not to acknowledge that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as Minister of "dark" on financial matters was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the '70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to fellow laborers, without going too far and without losing his office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “in any situation” - Benn’s expression - does not match what McDonnell said and neither did JC to colleagues and parliamentarians at the private meeting of Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - hold it, it also sensitized me - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the rotation of social networks, a focus of paranoia and treason.
It is right not to give Cameron a favor ticket in Europe, allowing him to take good support from the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbien's basic sophistication of EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his sophistication about NATO - Tom Watson is undisputed about the fact that JC will not campaign for surrender - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin be wasted political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists critical of the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of them with links in the tobacco industry.
Officials in the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published last month's "reference" report and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
However, a few researchers questioned the robustness of data and pointed to the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet's medical journal attacked the "extraordinary base of fragility" that PHE founded its main conclusion.
Another two researchers writing in the BMJ questioned their claims and grounded them “on solid ground or on moving sand”.
Martin McKee, European Public Health Professor at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They claimed that the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell or claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, about which executive director was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for the conduct of an independent study.
It also validated the BAT accreditation in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic cigarette producer but not the funding about which there are reports that it would have been received from the tobacco and cigarettes company, Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on the basis of which the panel members were selected, but among them are several known "companies" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the work the financing of the industry.
Other meeting participants are not known for their tobacco control expertise.
At the meeting also attended the head of the tobacco control section of the PHE.
The research carried out by the group "convincingly explores" that they lack "solid evidence of the harmful effect most products have on the majority of the criteria," said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE claims that "there is so far no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE Health Department, said he had responded in the past to BMJ's statements.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of two people who smoked all their lives lost their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk of electronic cigarettes for health is lower compared, but we must continue to study long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that comes out and those that does not come out of evidence, given in particular the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related disease and the annual costs incurred by the national smoking health system amount to £2 billion.
Clearly expressing the current evidence - namely that while the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risks, they only present a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfill our national duty.

Advertising that shames Great Britain's arms trade
Follow the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Drone awful killers!
Fierce to crush the ankles!
Bombs Disperse!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving traces!
The cheery voice and animated images leave no doubt that this commercial for the world's biggest arms trade is a big prize, made by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities' desire to sell weapons to repressive regimes through Defense and Security Equipment International at ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

However, a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and subways requiring a second look.
"Important announcement, do you travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London subway, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will fall on DLR Clients are asked to contribute to the cessation of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are carried out by artists who have exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group named Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 pound package of Allen keys that states that "it facilitates access to about one third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet."
The London Transport Region is not amused by this vandalism in the form of a steering wheel.
One of the parody announcements produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists increasingly ask questions and seek to make political work accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaboration with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world in order to have their art impact on society.
Another poster against arms trade that greets shuttleists traveling by subway.
The film by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP's director of creation, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the arms trade advertisement - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with making a more realistic commercial but “enriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more exciting.”
"They did a great job helping us to increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment in the trade," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms trade comes from inside the ExCel, where exhibitors offer fantastic products of euphemistics.
In a press release, Saab issued an order received from the U.S. Army on "AT4CS RS with shoulder support."
This includes “a unique-shaped foci that offer stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules to Live in Home
It's been 11 years since I moved to the home, when I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in beer and moral relativity, but I'm just reminded of the forced smiles of those who were angry - and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things we've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving to home can bring states that vary from nervous fall to terror.
The plague is tempting: tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year's study break, how you feel about Corbyn and why "sincerely, you don't care about Marmite because, for real boys, it's nothing but a hahaha drug extract, you find me in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
These souls talk to you and help you differentiate the people you like from those you would not talk to even if they would come to the pit and they would be the only ones who would have boats.
Don't choke people.
Sleepers often abound with drinking parties, movies and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and try their underwear.

Introverties have a special treatment at the university.
Your dormitory should be a refuge, but in many homes you build a losing culture through dorms, based on friendship, socialization and friends that last all your life.
All of this can be terrible for someone trying to charge their batteries.
None of this culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want you to be friends, but I want you to leave to recover the energy I've consumed by interacting with you."
Try to sit down when a colleague is exhausted from socializing - and try to send a text instead of knocking at the door.

Obviously, if you wipe someone's chicken is stealing, but if you take a drop of milk to put it in your tea, is it all stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve yourself even if it boils on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you - you're still trying to address the problem more mature than my roommate, who has colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole.
He's in jail now.
Do not make noise that does not let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it feels good, it's because you're going on your own.
A girl on the level with me asked her neighbor to slow down the music because it was 3:00 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give the music louder.
When they stopped music in the end, at 5 a.m., the girl was nice and let them sleep two hours before they made the most of the music, locked the door and left for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/survivor wife would move on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you were to confuse a mate with your future husband, you would couple, you would split up and you should meet every day and maybe even see him get all common friends?
Of course, you can't resist the heart - but if a sexy chaperone definitely isn't your future husband, at least try to be rational.
When you realize that someone has left their keys in the locked room, the line between prank and intimidation is finer than it seems.
A successful farce is funny, but it can distort in a few minutes.
You teach a funny and valuable lesson about safety by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and place the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but do not glue the goods to someone's ceiling more than twice.
Violent David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach’s time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people working, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as an initiator of a less ordinary project, right "city", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of talented international soloists and musicians, which interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes him at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a representation, on Sunday, in which the solo was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when in the foreground the violinist Xavier Phillips was found, the works composed by Enescu were missing.
Both shows, held on the scene of Athens, showed the public another way to play classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at that time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there is no conductor.
The director is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become an interpreter in an orchestra - I'm talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They're trained as "specialized workers."
They themselves feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all music fetishization is focused on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, he does marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have qualified workers on one side, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but you have to watch, which is stupid again," considers David Grimal.
The violinist tells us that this change in the way he does music came after the "musical disappointments" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise in the whole world with different orchestras, to win a lot of money and bring money and the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So I haven't found any point in continuing on this road.
So we decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one was doing this without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, didn't want such projects."
"How do I imagine you're marketing with a group of musicians where there's no ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the overall existence, the absence of a conductor has not proved to be a trap in the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex we sing a repertoire, the easier it seems, because all musicians are forced to be present in the opera and not only in the role," says Grimal, adding as to the Sunday show "we were 74 directors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", just because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where are present the largest orchestras in the world singing and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited and this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist recognizes that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's work into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "for there is also a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal is militating for the change in the way classical music education is made, considering that "the music industry, as it is organized today, has an issue of death" and that "the future of music represents itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it doesn't serve anything.
There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, all are great, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the music service.
If not, we're in a system in which creativity suffers, it doesn't have freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal set an example of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had vegetables and good meat."
To enter the EU, you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are in the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
With the music happening the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes reds may not be very beautiful, but when we cut them they are real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce his teaching in school, we reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell by-product music," says Grimal.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that stay very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it has to be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's quite different.
After your appearance, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist smile.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another kind of making music comes from the passing of this "soldier" status, the passing of what "you think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain time that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert there are smiles".
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and his vision of music and the artist at the "Ideal Festival", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
David Grimal's Profile
After following the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the direction of Regis Pasquier, during which he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the School of Political Science in Paris before meeting with Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed his life course.
David Grimal has an international career of solo violinist, along which he has maintained regular concerts in the last 20 years on the main scenes of classical music of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as Paris Orchestra, Philharmonic Orchestra of Radio France, Russian National Orchestra, National Orchestra of Lyon, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphoniker, New Japan Philharmonic, Opera Orchestra of Lyon, Mozartium Orchestra of Salzburg, Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Symphony Warsaw Symphony, under the leadership of addresses such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schwanwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pltnev, Rafael Fruêhbeck de Burgos and Peter Eotvos, Andris Nelsons, Christian Arming.
He was the recipient of dedicated works from several composers, including Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fuminori Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Harrowing, Anders Hillborg, Oscar Bianchi, Guillaume Connesson and Frederic Verrieres.
Along with his career as a solo artist, David Grimal had to explore and more personal projects.
The freedom that he offered to collaborate with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe through adventure in repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
In addition to Les Dissonances, he established "L'Autre Season", a series of concerts given to the benefit and together with people without shelter at the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.
Starting in 2008, David Grimal was a resident artist at the Dijon Opera.
He teaches violin courses at Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also held many master's courses and was a member of the Paris Long-Thibaud International Competition in 2010.
He received the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres distinction from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sings on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" from 1710, but also on "Don Quijote", a violin designed for him by French wrestler Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present at the International George Enescu Festival this year together with the Les Dissonances Orchestra, in the program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also went up on the stage on Monday, this time with violinist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Small Voices Big"
Cinema City launches the greatest challenge for children: dualing two characters from the superproduction "Crayal of the 3D Snowflake"
You have a super-talented and spontaneous child, who likes the movies?
Give him a chance to get the star.
In September, during the latest campaigns dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, they wanted to reach the next stars and who were between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Micile Voci Mari", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in classical drawings the focus was placed on the near voice of the actor of the specific animated character, in the last period, the creation of the story is also taken into account and those who are to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching an unpublished campaign.
We want to find the right voice and provoke parents to sign up for our contest.
They'll have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
"The kids will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11th and September 30th, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection that will be selected 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access to the small voices platform.cinema-city.ro, where to register the child at the contest and prepare it for voice test.
Later, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then the child will register by playing his own double version.
Four films about friendship, fairy tales, magic and hope can choose contestants to support the evidence: "Pene Yellow 3D", "Mone: Guardian of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: Koala the 3D Posena" and "Albinuta Maya 3D".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double a character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - 3D Snow Cream", which will be premiered in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx winnings are mixed, tax forecasts for 2016 decrease
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, the delivery giant reducing profit estimates for all year as a result of the low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s actions decreased by approximately 2.5% in premarket trading, 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it is expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
The analysts were advocating $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The lower estimate comes in spite of the increase in prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and the higher surcharges for the land transport of large or high-weight packages, which will apply since November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase gains compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director-General Fred Smith said that "the firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than is expected, in particular with regard to global production and trade."
The holiday employment plans were announced one day after the UPS competitor said he intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of commitments he made last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the previous year.
The gains per share were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
The profit grew by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who took part in the Zacks survey estimated $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has skipped the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, income from the Ground Division increased by 29%, but operational revenues virtually stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher basic rates, while revenues from the Freight Division decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market transaction, approximately an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
On Tuesday, it had dropped by 11% at year level and by 17% compared to the record maximum on June 11.
On the occasion of the most expected meetings in recent years, those responsible for developing policies within the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahon table to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank meeting room, a mural painting of the United States will be opened.
The map is meant to recall that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above anything else.
The Central Bank received a double burden from Congress: maximizing the employment rate in the US and maintaining price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be discussed by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force since the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a growing economy, recent global financial market turmoil could scare Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel & Co brokerage firm.
"But I believe that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase interest rate, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait longer," he said.
There is no consensus as to the decision that Fed will make, this itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of Bloomberg's recently questioned economists anticipated an increase in interest rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect Fed to postpone, a key indicator showing that growth probability is only 30%.
This would indicate a decrease on the stock market if Fed increased interest rate, except where policy makers would mitigate the strike promising that it would pass much time to the next growth.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The announcement was triggered by expectations that Fed's decision-makers will maintain the stable interest rate this week, John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if Fed increased interest rate at this time," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision-makers do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets".
Other experts said an increase in interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty related to the moment Fed was going to act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slowing down the monetary conditions that would confirm the US recovery force.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that he expected an increase in interest rate this year despite the high liberal objections such as more economic progress would be required.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by Fed as total employment.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to fail to meet the annual target of the central bank, Fed’s decision factors said that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices falling sharply.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them given labour market tension," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets began to enter fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial media dropped 16% below the record peak reached in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market somehow withdrew this month, the Dow index being now about 10% below the maximum of May.
For Fed decision-makers, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the time of interest rate growth.
"Without what has happened on the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, it would be more firm in the sitting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was official Fed.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy and that they have almost no data to rely on later events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed's major interests, so practically it should not be taken into account in making decisions.
However, in reality, Fed has become the world-wide monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, said that Fed could "close" its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake on global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly started, it is to be expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department of the Investnet welfare management firm Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has an oversized reaction history to changes in the financial market that seem to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body, which supported the increase in interest rate, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis affecting Asia led Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the limited identification potential for U.S. development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to those decreases.
Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the case of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, who was a member of the Bank of England interest rate setting committee.
The last tense period does not rise at that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to get in the situation to fear an increase in interest rate because they've upset the markets," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this direction, I do not believe that it should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite attempts by the Nine channel to broadcast in Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent shift of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of the changes from the ruling of the Liberal Party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning issue of the Nine Channel transmitted from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts carried out over a few weeks, which included Dubai, New York, Niagara Cascada and Cancun.
This "crossroad" of the distance did not seem to matter too much for Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today had a slight increase compared to the hearings of Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference from Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, not only is Parliament affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!

The main news was the amazing debut of the 800 Words series with him as the protagonist of the former star of Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, subject to a widowed father recently, who decides to move along with his two children on the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show alone, without the star from Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The hearing results for last night replied resoundingly that “yes”.
Show X The Factor transmitted by Seven remained in position with 1,136 million viewers, taking the easy face of The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven recorded ups and downs the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new moderate general culture show by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) went up to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia showed an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The decline of the hearing recorded by Chase Australia the second evening will give silent confidence to the Nine that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the new proposed constitution of the country, said an officer Wednesday.
Violence occurred Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to statements by Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas after they fired before resorting to rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, about which they know they can kill but are usually used as less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The crash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said that the new provinces established on the basis of the new constitution would erode their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes triggered on 10 August,
when four major political parties signed an agreement for the division of the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, the country governed at central level for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues to exchange lines with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the meeting of the Government on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm stand against the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or gun police.
"It's a shame for 21st century Europe to apply 30s methods," Victor Ponta said.
"The Prime Minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." ended the Prime Minister.
NHC announces 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide front of low pressure at about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde Islands presents a 60% probability of turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center of the United States said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined front of low pressure approximately half the distance between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of forming a tropical cyclone over the next two days, added the weatherologist in Miami.
Weight reduction surgery may be useful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether mildly obese diabetics live more after surgery for weight loss than those who follow neurosurgery treatments.
"It takes a lot of time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, called and bariatric surgery, use different methods to lower your stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a weight measurement unit relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18,5-24,9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the General Hospital Min-Sheng in Taiwan used the data narrow after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - bypass gastric and gastrectomy in the jaw - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in patients with surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year of the study.
In the meantime, BMI in people receiving neurosurgery treatment against diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Of those who had surgery, diabetes was completely cured by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes has been completely cured at only 1% and partly at only 2% of subjects.
In addition, the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
Researchers also monitored the level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of blood glucose over time.
Researchers say that the optimal level of haemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
Following surgery, the average haemoglobin level A1c decreased from approximately 9% to about 6%.
But in the medically treated group, it remained at approximately 8%.
But this improved “glycaemic control” - reflected by improved levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce mortality to five years, according to the researcher chief Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the gastroctomy group in manchon, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 compared to 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1%) and presented a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% compared to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery presented a probability of approximately 29% lower death after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 procedural interests.
“This is the point where this work is critical because it says that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” she says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that their patients and doctors should start taking the weight seriously then the BMI of the patient reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we urge people to take this aspect seriously," she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that shorten their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent a call to end the violence in the refugee countries.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of each nation and even of every continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring about peace and genuine development, especially through education, in Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce the crimes in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attacks on 11 September, claiming that the US violent response generated an uncontrolled chain of events.
After the events of 11 September, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without appealing to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
4-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergents in the last 4 years
According to Georgia's Anti-Virus Centre, U.S. poisoning centres reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in terms of the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed hands with high alcohol.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the anti-rotation centre in Georgia, cases of ingestion of the hand detergent in children under 12 years of age reported at the anti-rotation centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately one percentage of them reach the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some kids intentionally drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube you can watch movies showing teenagers how to drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that adolescents mixed the detergent with mouth water with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think it hurts him," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (of hand detergent) are perfumed.
Hand detergents with strawberry flavor, grapes, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-toxication center at Kansas University Hospital for Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hands detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four sprays with strawberry flavoured hands, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcoholism179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was bluffing and couldn't go when he arrived to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital to identify the signs of brain damage, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
He could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic wet products or serviettes and stop leaving the detergent at the hands of the children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents were associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after they swallowed hands detergents containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students in northern New York conspired to poison their "bad" teacher by "putting antibacterial products in class" according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned him in his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and raised the disciplinary issue of the school inspector.
Rumour Mill: There are no disagreements in Celtic
Griffiths echoes the rumors about Celtic's misconceptions, admitting that Hoops are not at the best moment but will return.
Hearts with SFA concerning Neilson and Warburton's charges are cautious about the acquisitions in January that have affected the team's unit
Dons increases the difference from Celtic to five points
The punishment of ADAM Rooney in the first setback brought to the Aberdeen a narrow victory in front of the Hamilton to Pittodria, Dons achieving a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dismantles rumors related to misunderstandings
There were rumors about disagreements in Celtic, dismantled by Griffiths, which insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure given that they are preparing to confront the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
The absence of Scots in the race for title bores the Dutch - by Boer
Former middleman Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters lost their interest in Celtic - because they didn't fight for the title of Rangers.
De Boer, now Ambassador of the Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands he no longer transmits the summary of the games to the Celtics; why?"
Because it's not Rangers there.
Here, we're not just talking about returning the Rangers.
They're talking about Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams and there's interest.
The tension is high in Old Firm matches and not just the Scots want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic is fighting out of power, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat of Malmo and the subsequent removal of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen that played in 10 people, now at the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Deila said: "Celtic has had periods before and will return."
We want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
So do we feel - but we need to go on.
We really need the support of Celtics because thus the players get better.
It's extremely important to stay united now.
Warburton's prudence on January Transfers
Despite the comments just a few weeks ago that suggested that some targets for January transfers would be identified, the chief of Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrix team's unit.
Former head of Brentford said: "January's transfer period is very different from summer's."
In the case of transferred players, there is the period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could observe in this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do worse if you bring in players that are not necessary.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
The Swansea Striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw at the end of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled with problems on the ankle and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts with SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Paterson was removed and they lost with 3-2, but the red card of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: “I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance.”
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
Invincible Hibee was taken for granted after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," said the striker, adding: "I don't need to say that I don't go back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United council still trusts that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground has to end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "poor victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the team in Aberdeen must desperately cling to Hamilton Acquies to achieve the seventh successive victory in the league, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the first re-run by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team to win anything, in the cup or league, and not to win such games."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain grows
RATE OF HOMAGE in Scotland remains unchanged, with 164,000 in the period May, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom overall increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that of the United Kingdom of 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the National Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over three months, the number of employees currently employed is 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% - a figure over the United Kingdom average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term government plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It's been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, I have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, employment rates and growth and unemployment rates.
Why am I a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a room for observers in the State Penitentiary's Execution Room Oklahoma and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, it terrifies my idea.
So, why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists can be witnesses to execution in America and, because usually requests exceed the number of places available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of places reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will look at the execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I would stay next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own connection with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I cried for her.
He acknowledged that "it could have been better," but it is still his view that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if he asked me.
I told him he could take me out of the witness list at any time.
However, they wish to have an international report on the subject.
He thinks if he dies, advertising will help move against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the series of media files we've made.
I'm not coming back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treee's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's probably not guilty of murder.
I certainly don't think there was enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't pretend I'm totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
You'll find out from me what it's like to watch a man who likes to die useless.
Peter Moody claims that the stewars tried to spy on him and threatened to withdraw from the races
Peter Moody said the Star Warrs Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy into his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the stewarz and the department of integrity of Racing Victoria, claiming that they carry out a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the removal of Lady Dadi from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result on Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about statements about spies and did not want to resemble “the fox that does not reach the grapes”.
"I wasn't going to say anything about that aspect and I've been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all falls apart," Moody said.
It's known it went on.
Sometimes you react and have to suffer the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that I'm trying to give them everything that's best.
From the moment they start to believe that it doesn't happen that way, I have to give up the trainer job.
At that point, I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview given for racing.com in which he said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
“Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man - whose name I will say if I am asked - and offered to hire him to my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he thinks I'm a cheater.
If so, then you should give up all because you were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the time and I know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to start having a spine and can hold people outside of the trains accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on industry?
So bad is my influence on industry?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and put me aside and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might cause them to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
Frustration of the trainer increased with the long cobalt test investigation involving Lidari and the removal led him to say that he could “put his license on the table”.
Moody, whose name is most commonly associated with the training of the undefeated Black Caviar champion, has labelled the treatment rule of the day of the race as "rigidal" after applying on the feet of horses a cataplasm with mud or clay, which violates the rules.
It's breaking the rules of the races.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put them on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months to treat the day of the race consisting of the application of the cataplasm, for which the Stewars opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand the need for rules, but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by escape from the crash site.
The biker was transported with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit Saturday morning by a car on Murray Valley motorway.
Police representatives say the driver of the vehicle didn't stop to help the injured biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man handed himself over to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be charged with running from the accident site, non-offering of the first aid and other road crimes.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in a stable state.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to the charges of wrestling.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms of the placard tactics used by his team as "denatured subjects" brought up to discuss the main two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said the referees allowed Storm players to "take them to the gate" team in the game that Storm won in the final qualification played on Friday night in Sydney.
The coach of Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match, played Saturday night, when he called that match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland are not too good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in the defense of his team's hacking tactics and said the players simply focused on the "contact" when they placarded.
Bellamy says she gained confidence after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us with score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, just so that in the last six weeks we've really put the emphasis on contact in plating and so we've changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so it's probably not used to losing and was a shock to him.
We love how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "the soul of football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawara Dragons of Bennett won the 2010 championship by playing football "supply".
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued his opinion comparing his game Saturday night with our game Friday night and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he doesn't care how black under his fingernails.
But now he has a team that can play what we consider to be exciting football, especially due to the middle young raptures.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his game style - not any team has two middles like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like this.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was a stronger score match compared to the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good match, haven't I seen it yet?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more tries, that means exciting game?
Or does it mean you take a break and don't sign?
It's plans for me.
If I talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm has this weekend free because they won the right to play at home either with North Queensland Cowboys or with Cronulla Sharks, in the final of Saturday's previews, at AAMI Park, putting the tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to lure the pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep and then authenticated in an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as a subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
He looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
After the arrival, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at that address and found “concerning” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "draw the pedophiles" on the Internet before "assuming he's a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee court: “He said it was an addiction — it was dependent to scare people.
He admitted that he searched the computer but said he did it because he wanted to become a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent his images and about the fact that he had asked that person to send them more pictures.
He said he did it to lure.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: "Then when the girl found the messages on the phone, she screamed at her mother and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23 years old, domiciled on Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges that he had taken or took indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of release on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March of the current year.
Defense counsel, Gregor Sim, asked Hogg not to be registered in the sex offender register because it can be said that this crime “has not involved a significant sexual aspect”.
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was passed on to the sex offender register before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, transmitted the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, the filming of the fall has not been hurt. It has become viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they would have received anonymous threats to death, threatening them not to mislead Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they dismissed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number, but it is entitled "death," he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the parliamentarians concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer worth it.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availabilitys
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 availabilitys as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year. HP will divide the stock exchange into two companies, separating the computer division and printers from operations with corporate hardware and services that are growing.
The anticipated availability will bring costs of approximately 2.7 billion dollars from quarter to quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring to the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure," said Meg Whitman, President and Director General HP, who will lead the unit after the break.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently and will hold a large business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business run style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate society, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and “will focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals” to companies.
A company set up in 1930 by Stanford University graduates, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, which is the subject of the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto has been called the "Lilicon Valley."
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest companies in the field of technology in the United States, is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: The comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of deaths in 20-45-year-old men in Britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, campaign against unhappy life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship lies at the heart of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy disposition”, his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces to half the probability of mental disorders.
Of course, in order for friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes priority before contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even though in reality isolation is the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which further affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money does not even buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that he focused on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they look at football in the comfortable folleries and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that men can be associated with this situation, even though they often fail to explore their feelings completely.
As a social worker explained to me: ..."my role in listening to people who tend to commit suicide and depressed showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference."
Often, the people who call us don't feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying to handle yourself is powerful, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak if you talk open about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer several long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective, external intervention, through the telephone, people reached in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you attend this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete editing of the film sets to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and greet.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to put Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG to set himself in front of the Swedish team Malmo.
We continue to present you the game's chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani made their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of matches in the League of Champions, with a peaceful 2-0 win against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of her debut match in the League of Champions in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before ensuring their advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in minute 61.
Coming to Group A with Real Madrid and Şahtorior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the aim of the French team is not only the best qualification but also an improvement of the course towards the final quarter in each of the last three tournaments.
But even though they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity of emptying after being replaced by the team in his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win home or move to the Champions’ League, so 2-0 wins create our opponents’ problems and makes a comfortable difference to the next class, even though there are still aspects that we need to perfect throughout the season,” Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I'm sorry we couldn't give another one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident at one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 retreat from Bordeaux home in League 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took the light of the reflectors in minute four.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the middle Argentine offensive was called the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he jumped to Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before he was incredibly whispering over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if someone expected PSG to win by punching their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders on national teams, with a defense of five men and two half-defensives, was a powerful opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making Nikola Djurdjic's whip that passed from Kevin Trapp's job in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed the pace a few times, giving a few unnecessary and non-finalizing steps, even Ibrahimovic who missed not less than five attempts only in the first round and was then replaced by Cavani right after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much better at supporting his colleagues, though he was the one Di Maria sent in a diverted from Wiland over the gate in minutes 52.
The second goal was inscribed in a final after an hour of the game was over, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who wrote the sixth empty in the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's center.
This goal has eliminated the hope of Malmo that they will rebalance Wiland's score and only a superb stop away for David Luiz's rejection has maintained the final score before the new entrance of Ezekiel Lavezzi cancels an empty extension.
Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that PSG was with a class over and that "the last game we played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I have played only in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Put the hat down for the PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from shares sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, who was hit by the drop in stock prices on the stock market, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a large debt reduction plan.
Glencore Company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is in the process of collapsing prices on the commodity stock market because China's decline in economic activity influences demand and causes disaster in the markets.
The preferential subscription right increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in transactions on Wednesday morning.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion as part of broader plans to cover almost a third of his debt of $30 billion.
The company sold new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, with 2.4% less than the closing price of Tuesday.
He took out of the company 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the growth of the prolonged stagnating Chinese economy has led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices of about half, and coal, copper and other goods have decreased by 20-40%.
Xi insists that the economy expand more globally
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group in charge of reforming that the economy needs to open wider to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must undertake to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," Xi said, during the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Continuation of General Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deeping Overall Reform).
Promoting the opening and encouragement of reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and will take place economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of state enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved by testing programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will provide the market with a more important role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a business environment based on legislation and providing a wider market opening.
The State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers delegated to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
China will also, as stated, allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In an attempt to open the State-controlled sectors, several sectors will be opened to private investments.
“State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment companies and provide them with better services,” the statement stated.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called ‘green cards’, optimising requirements and smoothing the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the right to practice lawyers and educating judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli took part in the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, not happy with the Government's proposal to raise salaries by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the unions in Education have not achieved any results, the government proposing a 10% salary increase, from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase, from November, or 20%, from December.
The discussions took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The Government's proposal today has not thanked us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to convene the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent that we've been promised today is less for us than we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money that we have entered into in our agreement with the Government last year, for 2016," said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
Bridge: In the future health and education will be the areas where we will invest all the money we have
According to him, Thursday, there will be an FSLI meeting to which government representatives will also participate to present the proposals for wage growth to confederate representatives in the country, following that trade unions will decide if they accept the Executive's offer.
The Prime Minister also told the trade unionists that the Government is trying to send the Payroll Act to Parliament as soon as possible, so that it can enter into force on 1 December.
The regulatory act foresees the increase of salaries in the education system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, the increase foreseen in the document to be balanced over the next four years.

Over 100 Stewardeses, fired because they were too fat
The Air India Air Company fires about 130 stewarzi and Stewardese because they are overweight, announced the company at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was made on the grounds of the government's security and recent regulations, but critics say that the measure is "ridicola" and "stricken by sexist", says The Washington Post.
Mass delivery is the most recent of a ten-year battle between company and the most crowded stewardess.
Weight limit for them dates from the 1980s, when Air India began using graphics with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the new Stewardese deemed "extraordinary" because this fact "may have an effect on reflexes and may prevent the necessary agility to carry out emergency measures".
Stewardeses sued the company, won and were re-employed, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them weaken have failed," explains a carrier of the company.

Technical details must not be their concern.
They have to value their talent.

Simona had only words of praise at Cahill's address, which seemed to be the only coach who managed to get in front of the whimsical sports.
The program at Adidas will end but at the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or to give up collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We'll talk and see.

Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to raise his salary to stay, but he was refused.
Right now I'm not sorry I left the national.
Then I thought I was sorry, leaving a job behind.
That's how I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selectioner, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions in the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very hard at that time, with the results I had, plus that it was the financial situation in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and probably changed it too.
But I wanted to go.
If he wanted to stay, then I proposed a contract increase.
We have about 400 and a thousand euros a year, then we have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we ended up in the first place in the group," Victor Piturca said to Dolce Sport.

When he first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he drinks alone, he's an alcoholic in secret'," he tells, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's footage with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't recognize himself, "I was looking in my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although he doubted for a while, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers as Nick's breath smelled alcohol.
The moment that put Nick's thoughts the most out of his mind was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had a three-fold alcoholic strength over his legal limit, although one night before he had not consumed a single beer.
After years and investigations without number, it was found that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Practically, the body or makes all the carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.

The cited source shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the States of the immediate vicinity of Romania, steps are being taken to manage the situation of the unit and consistency of situations caused by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants in the territory of Romania, generated by situations of political, social, economic or military nature.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay special attention to citizens from states with potentially migrationist or that may affect national security," added the mentioned source.

T.V.R. Management Activity Report, Rejected in Commissions: Stelian Tanase Risks Disembarkment
The Committees of Culture of the Parliament rejected the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Roman Television Society on Wednesday 2014.
In order to reject the report, 17 parliamentarians voted against the rejection (Mr. Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the permanent bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary session will be discussed.
"I think considering this situation will be done relatively quickly," said the president of the Senate Culture Commission, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was a good feeling" as the TVR management was present at this meeting, under the conditions that no representative of the TVR management was present at the Committee on Culture.
It was good to be present at the TVR because no one here has been subjected to any personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members earlier last night, about an hour that we didn't know now, but today, after the meeting of the assembled bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I believe that when you're summoned, you're a budget employee, paid by public taxes, and you're called to a meeting of assembled committees even if you don't like to live.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under the command of Parliament," Severin said after Parliament's Committee on Culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw as they went on, came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they didn't pay for the historical ones.
"I remind you that not because of me or anyone else in these committees has lost that pleasure with the banks and with the tax, there are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the reconvened plenary, elections will be followed for a new Board of Directors, and he will elect the director general of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Wonders won't be done.
It is important to make political decisions so that this institution will function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will sit on the tail here and beat himself.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote will choose the people who will drive the TVR with great rationality.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities you have to have - good feeling toward the employees because it's a mess of little ones coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
"When you receive such referrals 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster," the president of the Senate Culture Commission concluded.
Although it did not appear in Parliament, the President-General of the TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that Parliament should have a number of measures which could lead to the saving and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexing of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexing of the TV fee, the amendment and completion of HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public television service, for the purpose of updating provisions on the level of technological changes on a daily basis, as well as for the regulation of the procedure for controlling the payment of the TV tax and the finding of infringements and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wishes to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv representatives for the collection of the TV fee, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a ceiling of up to 5% of the commission in cash.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for the CNC from 15% to 3%, but also for the amendment of the Act 41/1994, in order to receive budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sports events - World Championship of Football, Golden Cerbul, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will be unable to pay in the following months considering that the labour law obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not definitive, and pay rights are accorded priority to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenses with staff and TV production.
"As a result, travel and other cost-generating activities have been reduced, a number of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post has been closed," the letter of President TVR.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be corrected only by its own efforts.
"Without the support of the State institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Roman television will be found, sooner or later, in the impossibility of fulfilling its public mission", mentioned in the letter.
The conduct of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.

Elie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to make his policy anymore.
The PSD Senator will serve as Vice President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, remaining free after John Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper was about to play the role of a chef in the "Burnt" movie, the actor made a breakthrough that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew more in the kitchen: "I've worked a lot of my life as a cook."
He discovered that he had been working in the kitchen for 15 years, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, because then, in college, he continued on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the whole childhood cooked with Italian grandmother, relates ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man who would make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you'd laugh at if I told you," he said, but he said that what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
Up to the age of 40, the actor admitted that he is seen in the near future directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who has taken the lead at this age.
Bridge, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational assertions
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto sentenced, Wednesday morning, the statements of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to their political decisions in Hungary are "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, by his irrational claims, he insults the entire Hungarian minister," he transmitted Hungarian Foreign Minister in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he lost total support in Romania's internal policy," he added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday night post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to attract attention and sanction the behaviour of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a shame for the culture and values of the European Union".
I don't want to respond to the challenges that came from Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" said Ponta on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that he is the adopter of rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, recognizing that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Sarma, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, politics are no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which they run!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - which we see in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!" stressed the head of the Roman executive.
Previous Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta as "simple lies" on the management of the refugee crisis by Hungary, recognizing that these claims are inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extreme and lying remarks" of the Roman Prime Minister on the internal political crisis in Romania and stated that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm against xenophobic speeches the idea to close the borders, like all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense by the Middle Ages and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get it, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people like some people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with the coat and the insert.
"That's what I disagree with," said the head of the Roman executive at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest has decided to start preparations in the field for the extension to the border with Romania of the fence that it builds at the border with Serbia, to face a possible change of the route used by migrants.
The Prime Minister Victor Ponta later stated that Hungary's decision to raise a fence at the border did not solve any of the refugees' problems and "outside Hungary from Europe".
What's the connection between Osama bin Laden and the macaral collapse of Mecca?
Saudi authorities announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partially responsible for the collapse of a crane on Friday, on the Mecca Moschee Sea, an accident following 107 people died.
According to one investigation commission, the company did not "respect the safety rules", reported the Saudi press agency (SPA), BBC.
The company's directors were forbidden to leave the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by former terrorist leader's brother Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years at the expansion of the Grand Mosque, to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred Friday night, during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong wind gusts, collapsed on the east side of the Grand Mosche roof of Mecca.
Following the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi closed the contestaries' mouth
Considered by many world the greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi has been labeled, after withdrawal from activity, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform performance and in the new position.
After unhappy experiences with the national team, Stara or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Constant Future, the team that he owns.
After a year after the team took over, the King demonstrated that he was able to transform a team that was struggling to rescue from retrogradation into a top.
Thus, after one year, the future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 winners, 11 remixes and 11 breakers.
The balance sheet is one of a top team fighting European cups.
Things took a better and better tower for the Future this season, because the team arrived in the second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double than the Star.
On the other hand, even if he brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start team came up names like Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
Club policy made in the future a follow-up team for foreign teams, so Hagi sold this summer of 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Florentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Alongside the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
The big countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the governing college of the Roman Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and the means of police will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we may have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality that we have to adapt to as well and adapt to them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we were at an extremely emotional moment when politicians felt the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must change: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted for the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the predictions said they had the necessary votes.
Prior to the Lisbon Treaty, the unanimity principle applies in JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, the reactions of rejection even in Germany against the policy of opening Chancellor Merkel and they didn't want it to appear in many countries as a reaction of the type "EU sending migrants over our heads".
They therefore postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably assist in major changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just let go of it?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agencies.
The border of Greece with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the first-time State, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece capsizes, you can't tell infinity that it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve a solution without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism to impart the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how compulsory quotas will work, if it gets to them.
Because there's a problem: what do you do with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will be taking over migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It is likely that there will be some single filtering centres in Greece or Turkey where asylum applications will be processed.
They're working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophob current.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
One estimate says only 10% of them have gone, winter is hard from the Mediterranean past, but we expect next year to an even bigger wave.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it so badly in the media.
You were talking country with less or more experience.
Does there really seem to be a place where large groups from an extra-European culture have been integrated?
I'm looking at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean it doesn't integrate at all.
There remains an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But only the police will not work.
To create the fortress of Europe is illusive.
The integration mechanisms in European societies need to be addressed.
Here were some mistakes.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn their language, try to take the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family including by the brides of convenience.
It must separate, however, the imminent problem of these people from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we have to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean it's going to be restored overnight and you can take it back.
Until solutions appear, we see forts within Europe.
Walls have been closed, walls have been raised, border controls have been reintroduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where they set foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean, we're out of the way, but everyone's in trouble.
In front of such a wave you can't be like this, because some countries don't face.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run it doesn't change much.
After the French attacks, we do not have much more dramatic anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we did last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of belligerent statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the drowning child in Turkey and public opinion gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I don't think the Europeans will abandon this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted for the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a little country, who thinks that if he pulls the back of his eye and blinds his ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Great countries come with solutions for the entire EU, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will fall very much.
President Iohannis says it's probably not in yet.
So we move from despair of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
There is, of course, a risk that Romania and Bulgaria will join Schengen so that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
What doesn't mean it's a reason we're not going into Schengen anymore, but we're more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that the external borders will become common responsibility, there will be single rules for the acceptance of migrants, one rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, one rules for the countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia has frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being great power means that you can confuse Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed a long time ago.
And it was good to collapse before the principal or opponent was the Islamic State.
About two years was a battle between the Assad regime and the moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia could complicate things, but can't participate in the solution.
It creates a focus on instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you're powerful only if you have solutions.
The game off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Maybe Putin's waiting to get bids, press the buttons to fix the situation.
The offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that it can solve in some way or other matters created by it all.
But I disagree with the theories that say these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will soon appear
Millions of Facebook users got used to the "Like" button, and now representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike".
Marti, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will soon be available, informs New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg specified that the "Dislike" button will look more like a cloud of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid the moments when someone posted on the account or an important event in life, and someone else would give "Dislike".
The network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long demanded that they have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" current events, such as refugee crises, or in the event of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving like that post," said Facebook representative.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and social networks," Atiq Haneef said in Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article with this topic was posted.
"I'll give 'Dislike' the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, claimed there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, media social analyst at the eMarketer company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports, the electoral campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands of mass incomes at its southern border with Serbia, announced Government Counsellor Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main crossing point of the border and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, recalls DPA.
The measure attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
They said yesterday that they would seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who wish to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Refugees, Aleksandar Vulin.
Prior to the imposition of the new immigration legislation, a record of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also registered in Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" headquarters of the Judicial Council stands to fall.
Two constructors in insolvency
Massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are to give up because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The seat of the Judicial Council in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up falling alone.
At one and a half years since the building's consolidation and recasting work had to be completed, the work did not reach half.
A final step in the building’s epic era was completed last days, when the National Council for the Settlement of Consents (NCSC) rejected a complaint from the firm that wanted to take over the contract for the completion of the technical project for the work that is to be carried out.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the manufacturer and the termination of the works, negotiations procedures were initiated without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the firm was to update the technical project and then a new tender for the works was organised.
"The negotiations did not end through a contract, however, and CJ appreciated that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution," Rázvan Timofciuc summarized, represented public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to terminate direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing court sent the complaint to CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of the Court can be considered finding another designer.
Thus, building building consolidation could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We're waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The consolidation work of the former headquarters of the Police Management began in 2011.
A first contract of work was terminated in April 2012, after work of 4.5 million lei was carried out.
The tender was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm entered into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payment of 1.5 million lei.
The work has so far been carried out in proportion to about 50%.
Initially, the building's consolidation, reconstitutionalisation and attic had been assessed at 7,7 million lei.
"All right, I'll say it all!" - the statement that could incriminate the former chief of Cadastro
One of the employees involved in the scandalous record of the Office of the Register signed an agreement for the recognition of the facts, against imprisonment with delay.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, in front of the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A councilman from the Office of Real Estate Registration and Advertising (OCPI) accused of DNA in a corruption file recognized his telefap.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dskălu was registered yesterday at the Iaşi Court of Justice, establishing a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dskălu was accused of false intellectuals in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in the hall with delay as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to the facts attributed to Dșălu, prosecutors stated that he, as counsel of the Cadastru Office, together with other colleagues, "made a false number of verbatim acceptance processes, sold the previously-key service supply contracts by O.C.P.I. Iasi with the administrators of SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC The Ca dastru Agency and Topographies SRL and PFA Lipșa Ştefan, which testified, in an unrealistic manner, that the contracted services were fully performed, under conditions where they were not performed and were not submitted to O.C.P.I. Iaşi".
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but other former or current employees of the OPCI were brought to trial in this file, the charges being the commission of services to the aforementioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
The trial exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the national women handball for qualifying at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the League of Champions.
With regard to Romania's national women's handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Rio Olympic Games, but for this it must go from two stages of tailings, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," said Dedu.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masseurs, gate coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualification of things, more precisely material for physical training, which we've never heard of.
These all to get to the Olympics. And I'll do everything it takes to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age with the preparation.
"The teams we fight with have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who said that he is trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The president also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and to the possibility that our country should host a major handball competition.
We don't have room in Bucharest.
It's an infrastructure problem and it's shameful to be questioned by a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that other corners of the world have built entire Olympic neighborhoods over a period of two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona was a dump of garbage, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympic organization was a success and investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," said Dedu.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but it was very quickly resolved that the room would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them we wanted, we were able to organize and they said they agreed and invited them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discussed concrete.
"So we have all the opening, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure," said FHR officer.
The former great handbalist has avoided evaluating the chances of women's CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare teams to arrive at Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in predictions, that if they do not perform they will turn against them."
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbiists debut on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said, on Tuesday, at a press conference, that all members of the Romanian lot are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to get two winners: "We're ready."
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at the peak shift.
We trained to give the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are tough and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first time with France and then we'll see.
But certainly, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participation in the World Cup, it's the meeting of so many years of work.
I want not to disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, represent tricolor pride," Macove told.
Romania's National Team Selector Lynn Howells, who first experienced as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It's a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me it's an extraordinary experience.
For me it's very important that every game I make Romanians be proud of national team.
President of the Romanian Federation of Rugby, Haralambie Dumitraș, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in rugby in recent years.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish sportsmen success and I believe we will be at the heart of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams at the age of 18-19, so there is cohesion, it's a band of friends who set themselves to realize a dream," Dumitra said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve in Group D, with the following scheduled matches: France, on 23 September in London; Ireland, on 27 September in London; Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at the Twickenham stadium in London, with the match England - Fiji from group A.

Registrations take place until September 30, and those who want to ask for more information can do it by phone number: 0742.027.153 or by e-mail address: studentsculture@gmail.com.
14 million lei you give to the Hospital "Sf. Spiridon" from Iași to the correction of the budget
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The "Sf. Spiridon" hospital received approximately 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health following budgetary correction.
The money that the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in works to modernize and provide clinics, but also in medical equipment and techniques for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology device, with six kits used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds equipped with appropriate ophthalmogenic microscope and other equipment required for medical action.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received from the hospital will be directed to the construction and repair work of the "Mareulua Ars".
From the money from the budget correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main section.
"In addition, the next few days we will receive the works from the gateway linking UPU of cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure decent transportation of the UPU disease in nearby clinics," explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have in the courtyard and Dermatology Clinic in Tătaraşi, which will organize it in the ambulatory, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where allergology, hematology and endocrinology are located in the ambulatory and will have about 30 beds.
The jacket, laughed at by RATP controllers and a folder.
The wallpaper of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience neither I nor my wife ever want to tread again in your city.
Unwanted, they hit the wrong information from the foldrs, the misnourished RAPT controllers and, bonus, a "law" fine.
The wives arrived in Iaşi a few days ago, settled in a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist packages.
They also got a folder in which the RATP tracks were passed.
"Arranged" with these maps, the husbands visited the Iaşul.
But two days ago, you found out in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because she wasn't a ticket to the station next to Copou Park, they relied on the printed information on the payer: that they can take the ticket via SMS.
No one told them this service no longer exists.
Trustees in the fold, they got on a bus and tried to send text messages after the instructions on the folder.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said there was no service for two years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
Where would I know what was written in the local press, I'm coming one night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, said they don't care, it's not their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is give us one fine instead of two (my and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day visiting stand at the Jandarmerie and giving statements there!" Ovidiu tells.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of the erroneous information on the payer and the controllers who "implyed the law to the blood".
It's not right, and I did a session at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not over-rated, but the idea is that I felt cheated.
Bad luck to the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in preventive arrest
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui moved yesterday to the Iasi Court of Appeal.
The Jesuit magistrates tried the first term of trial at a non-public meeting in which the seven youths accused of mocking an 18-year-old asked to be released.
Before the very beginning of the trial, one of the Jesuit judges whose file had been distributed, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.
The judge activated until the summer of this year at Vaslui Court, where he was the President of the Section on Nale, who, on 9 April, admitted a complaint by four of the accused, providing for their detention at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete of which are members of the Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file he made an abstention and Judge Dan An Ton, because his daughter was in a relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vaslui's rapists would continue to be in preventive custody.
Your nerves will remain incarcerated for at least 30 days, when the Jews will revive the possibility of their release.
The next judgment shall be held at the Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Iasi, the van with which the rapists from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident produced in the Paccurari district, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
Iveco's autoutility with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks wagen car that got out of the Singa street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van runs from the end of the parking lot.
The car entered Iasi around here because the employees of the Prison Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi on the Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They cut the road a few miles away.
Immediately after impact, the escort of the arrests called for another transport, to take over the prisoners.
In short, a car was sent to the accident site from the Iași Maximum Security Prison, which took over the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
Following the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the wheels, and the arrests came out in speed, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the door cars were amiably understood as to the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Medalin Tăranu of the IPJ.
Large migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and clear: the 7,000 refugees that should and should naturalize Romania are, in itself, a insignificant number, but huge compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to about 1500 souls, goes far beyond the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinaryly small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose patience.
Parasited by interruptions and paralysed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The failure to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color were unable to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent medical assistance, raise street poverty, create honorable jobs or keep their own younger generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what causes a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first struck by the belligerent fascists of the strong EU states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearless hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably afraid of stealing from someone who's national.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they only invoke the horrors of the war as a reason for the departure, accept no other destination of the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Also, the simple way in which the crisis is analysed can only be a challenge.
It is necessary to remove the causes, to support some and, strictly on the book of political correction, to ask for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, something foreign capital in the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosed, disbanded and above all.
I was complaining that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here the EU does not have any future plans.
And improvisations and threats don't help at all.
What, then, does the EU still use, if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders as through cheese?
At some point, the Syrian war will end.
Not even the crisis of migrants.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa into a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is neither and will never be prepared for what will follow.

Two brothers from Tomesti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds and 11-year-olds from Tomesti, brothers, swallowed several pills from Diazepam.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was taking a treatment, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were rushed to the "Saint Mary" hospital in Iasi.
They're stable, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20, he received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital under dark conditions, in the black of the '90s, when she had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by an educated family in Italy, in the same years when the adoption was regulated, a young woman, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met on the other side in Iasi with biological parents from a village of the county, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought of giving their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iasi, to get to know her past.
"The Day of Iasi", who assisted in the search of the original family after some very vague clues, was witness to these meetings that practically broke your heart.
Reporting of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are indeed moving and overwhelming.
The story begins 20 years ago in the exit town of Ruginoasa, when he was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the hospital, in the city.
At home, there were differences between parents, and my mother had to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl, and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I've never known anything.
"When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and still the girl's father, Costica Balcan, went to work in Alexandria City, Teleorman County.
Their lives would finally split up.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After his admission, Crinai's father went to work in another town, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, never found her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"I would have thought she was abandoned," tells a niece of the family.
Because of financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one has ever been interested in the fate of the child at all this time, she was taken over by the Directorate General for Social Assistance and the Protection of the Iasi Child, who then gave her to care for the Plasement Center in Bucium.
It was years when abandonment and adoption were lighter than today in Romania.
At the Buccium Center was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple in Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love instead of the blonde Crina, and after a while she was going to move with them permanently to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"As my wife would have given her life," tells us smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, while he catches in his palm the girl's fiery hand.
In the country, Krina's parents, Alina and Costica, continued their search separately, each where he could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but he received no answer where his child could be.
The police then sent him that he might have died, but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her are gone.
We prayed to God to be good.
I've been thinking about it all these years, but there's been no way we could walk, find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of Crinia's biological mother.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents from Romania," Crina confesses.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Roma Commissioner Ichim, Director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counsellor Iasi, was contacted by a knowledge of Italy, which explained Salvadore's desire to find the organic family of Crinai.
And the search started only from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I just got a name, the Coastal Balkans, then the town, the Ruginoosa.
Soon I had an activity with the mayor's office there, and I could ask if there was a local name.
Then they gave me a few indications, just that the person found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It finally took about a month to find the girl's biological father," Commissioner Romique Ichim explains.
In total, more than three months they took the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that each had a home in another place.
We started our moves somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," added Romique Ichim.
On the weekend that passed, Alina and Costica first saw the girl lost on the corridors of the hospital in Iasi 20 years ago.
The father, excitedly, could hardly control his tears, and his hands were constantly shaking.
He barely changes a few words with the people around.
A week before the meeting he couldn't even sleep.
He was still nervous, trembling.
"To see your child after all these years, it's something," a niece tells us, she also comes with Costica from Ruginoasa.
Meeting the Cririne with Mother and Biological Brother
In the discussions with his daughter, who is about to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Costica Balcan told him, among other things, that if he wanted to ever return to him, in the village, he could come calm: he could give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and crouch a household.
My mother is also excited, she cries, and she hardly believes that such a thing could happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking about those years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a connection," he tells us with great tears on Alina's cheeks, Crinai's mother, while holding a napkin in her hand.
In it he hides his tears, of happiness, because soon he will see himself with her after such bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will fulfill in just a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she drew a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are finally the ones who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family meeting in Iași
In the Union Market, under the early autumn sky, the family of Ruginoasa rejoins their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, she finishes high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
I don't separate borders or countries anymore, but just a barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iaș, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that, in the future, if the opportunity is taken again, they will do it again.
It's the first event this way organized, such an emotional load, and I'm glad to be a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that only deals with people who consume, people dependent on drugs.
But we're trying to restore companies something good back.
"If I'm still being asked for such an event, I'll do it with great affection," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Advisor.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, are moving apart by storytelling.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with guns on your foot yesterday at the PSD.
Everybody pulls their soul.
The camps in the outgoing PSD branch have concluded an armistice with the gun on their feet.
After successive rounds of discussions, carried from Friday to Sunday, first and most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Press the executive president of the party, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Social-Democrats will send him an entire list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
From the end of it, the internal war of the party seems to have taken only one break to allow fighters to draw their soul.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message under current conditions: try to find a solution not to endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"By then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of the weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing certain was not established.
In the October elections, a strong competition is expected for the role of president of the county subsidiary of the PSD.
On the short list of potential candidates to the main function of the party's outgoing branch is Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, the county councillor Vasile Cantea and the interim president of the Judicial Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could also be added to the mayor of Schutu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
One option taken into account is also the candidacy of the head of the PSD's county council, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer be in the race, sources within the party claiming that it is not interested in function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last few days is that of the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day candidates may be tabled, and they would not surprise anyone if it happened.
"The important thing is that we stay united, and we will stay together after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Bureau, a new Permanent Judicial Bureau and all the new driving structures," said Quanta.
Until the internal election is organised, the management of the county subsidiary of PSD will be assured by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on vacation until 29 September, preparing the elections to be practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, the county councillor Mihail Popescu, in a cold relationship with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the talks in the last few days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It has reached a partial consensus to support a uniting team to deal with the county.
"On the other hand, there are several variants of the intentions related to the candidacy of the Iasi PSD presidency, the list remaining open," said Stanciu.
An outgoing judge refused Vaslui's rapist file on grounds of cohabitation
The seven young people of Vas County convicted of rape arrive today at the Iaşi Court of Appeal.
Vasluiens sentenced to punishment between five and eight months and eight months and four months today will present their arguments on their release, after the Court of Justice Vaslui established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was delivered.
The file was registered with the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making an application for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton has invoked that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luke defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest penalty in this file.
How the Judges Were Motivated
At the end of last week, the magistrate at Vaslui Judiciary who sentenced the seven young men motivated the sentence.
The judge speaks of the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
"The institution finds that, after the time of placing the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of liberty, under the influence of the indictees, their families and their local supporters, a strong sense of indignation was felt at the level of the local and national community as to the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged to a lesser extent", it is shown in the motivation of the Judge of Vaslui.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be "the church door".
"The institution stresses that the moral quality of the injured person is of no relevance, which the accused wanted to highlight by the defences they have formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," it further states in motivation.
Corbyn, Brexit and the Future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they enjoyed over the last ten years cannot continue the same in the following years.
Until Saturday probably a few people knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the British Labour Party, many wonder how much we can be affected by the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing leader of post-war workers.
Marxist declared, anti-monarhist (at one point Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, asked him to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), an anti-American ferocious and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (was also invited regularly to comment on political events by the "Russia Today" television channel), and the terrorist movement Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and exit NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is close to the United States.
After the model of all populace demagogues, Corbyn, of course, has miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things about the type of people he was telling and promising and Tsipras in Greece until he breast-feeded with the real world and economic legacies.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader includes, inter alia, massive renationalisations and the printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the money-printing solution is not unanimously adopted around the world, then we would have a global overall prosperity! but who else prevents such details.
Of course, we can charge blood on bankers, become some kind of left service enemies, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous promises, without cover, made by populist demagogy.
As Margaret Thatcher's attention was well drawn to, "the problem of socialism is that at some point someone else's money is being spent."
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left leader, Michael Foot, who was not as strongly convinced as the party's fresh leader, failed regrettablely in the elections.
And then there is still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more sensitive than they are now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the whole of the labour force, and extensive automations have made the industry require a massive high-skilled workforce, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited call.
But even from opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its last issue Financial Times considers Corbyn's choice to increase Brexit's chances and the exit of Great Britain from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that imposed the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this type of idea with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the crisis of refugees who rock from the EU foundations you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for the Great Britain.
But if the British decide following the referendum, which would take place until 2017, to leave the Union the symbolic capital loss for the entire European project and the deep failures created within it of the Euro crisis and now of refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
The more so as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (where however Berlin becomes more and more the dominant actor).
It's true, the British business environment, the City, are powerful lawyers of staying the country in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments, which grow in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I have even recently shown in Jean Clude Junker's speech, is increasingly trying to make major decisions over the heads of the great majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens in conditions where electoral support for anti-terrorism, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and Euroceptives increases spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative load has reached higher rates than ever before.
From where and the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from national interest.
If the voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today's politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we are going to see a more pronounced integration of the Euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest and the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds its populist rhetoric on the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity that has enjoyed over the last ten years, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-Immigration zone, both caused by hasty decisions that have taken into account only the inclusive political ambitions, and not the ability and availability of Europe's peoples and governments to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the EU's internal tensions will increase in intensity and may further affect Romania's situation.
And it's hard to rule out something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncuși, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brunches: "Take and open the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to be famous, to hear about him all over the world.
But behind his name is something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name too.
It's called "truder."
What do you write about Constantin Brâncuși?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure showed up on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising flash.
Brancuși produces and delivers money at almost 60 years since he is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards bearing his name.
Furthermore, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when she comes out with edrasla, she hears the following instructions: "Let's go to the park, to Brâncuși."
The country is plagued by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to older people.
Brâncuși's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Not even the Communists were able to remove it from Romania's memory and culture.
His cities are spreading the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would be said, to write about this man?
Looked at the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that, if you didn't have the chance to be born in any big city and in a family as smart as you are, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brâncuși's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe the following text should begin from here.
With a sentence, as hateful as they are.
Look at the success stories of idiots, who are delivered to you every day in newspapers and television.
Watch this man's figure carefully.
You want to know how he managed to make it alive, how, today, did he hear a whole mapamond?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the municipality of Peșșani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Marie and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a family of wealthy peasants, Brâncuși leads a modest life, but one of which would collect his posters that would guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places he grew up in, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Peter Tuțea, from Paris, from 1933: "By then life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people led, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything passed quietly from one season to another.
And you know why things changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
But Brâncuși's childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuși was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the tunic was done "at the boiler", following those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going properly, Brâncuși caught a moment of general neglect.
He fills his palms with tunics and drinks on the ground.
He falls into sleep almost instantly.
First people only notice after a few minutes.
My mother panics, then hysteria, believing her son died.
By evening, when his father, Radu, returns from life accompanied by the praisers, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who await him with their soul in their mouth.
The party immediately turns into a jale.
Dad's already thinking about burial.
However, someone thinks it's good to call Baba Brandșa, dophthoroes and Brâncuşi's servants.
The cheese checks the child's breath, then puts them under the horse whale's nose, gathered around.
The child sneezes strong.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further on his drinking, joy, the party with praise continues with more force.
The next day, the father and son meet in the alley.
Radu Brâncuși has Constantine collect some knots and bring them.
The father puts his baby in his head down and, with the nuances brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while it feels the heat of the hits, the little Brancuși has the revelation that the world can be looked at from a different perspective and that things around it can be reversed.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit to old age, unless the star himself participates in his disorder.
Had the sun also been as troubled as his father as what had happened to him?.
At current time, the city does not work
A parliament member appeals to politicians to remind those who voted to him.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop internal struggles and reorient their agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great breakdown and so on.
I didn't see any of the 2012 USL projects going on.
Nor highways, nor Regional Emergency Hospital, just see how politicians argue about their possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let's put aside politics, gather and talk.
At this time, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blăjut said.
He appreciated that the current political class disenfranchised the outgoing electorate, the consequence of which was to be a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the party's faithful electorate.
The MP also believes that voters will continue to focus on traditional parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Iaşi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break out of the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such games are based on civic active people, who are usually on the right.
"It crumbles even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," Blăjuț said.
He stated that he was not interested in a candidacy for future local elections, denying the rumors about his intention to join the City Hall race.

There's little money.

It happened to rise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and other accounts.
"Let's say a parliamentman doesn't get his money. It's pure hypocrisy," Blăjut concluded.
