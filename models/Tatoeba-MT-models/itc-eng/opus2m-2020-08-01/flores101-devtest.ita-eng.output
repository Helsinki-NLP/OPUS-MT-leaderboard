This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely diffused, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown brown in the upper part, with pale or carotenoid colouring in the lower part.
The discovery also allows for detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the lead of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachide, but has other typical characteristics of feathers, beards and beards, researchers have concluded that the rachide is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.

The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at Westminster Magistrates Court is scheduled for 16 February.
The victims were Nicholas Alden 25 years old, and the driver Zachary Cuddeback 21 years old.
Edgar Veguilla reported injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider had to undergo a face reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was put to the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind from an eye, he lacks a section of skull and his face has been rebuilt in titanium.
Schneider testified via video conference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the Wednesday event, Carpanedo took part in two single championship races.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the test.
The other race he participated in, the giant slalom, saw him ranked tenth in the female group of the category "seduti", with a combined journey time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes to the first ranked, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than 1:09.02 minutes to the ninth place of Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four women's skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Slalom Giant did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police were able to retrieve the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with the covered face.
None of the three people who were at home at the time of the car crash got hurt.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road in which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the Red TT Audi.
He was initially housed at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital.
From that moment on, Adekoya is at the court of the sheriff of Edinburgh with the charge that he has killed his own son.
She is detained pending referral to trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eye witness may be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University "journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects walk on an area of interest".
The Crown Office, which has the general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has specified to journalists that no new comments will be issued at least until the formal indictment.
According to the fact that it was transcribed, the subject of the document will be the dispute over borders, that Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other topics dealt with include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred for both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental programme for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of the hunting program of the Association Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS in collaboration with the Association Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) composed of nine members.
This is the fifth interim electoral council in Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed a package of measures to push the country into new elections, including the resignations of the previous CEP.
The committee constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which started in October, which are in dispute with the regime.
The occasional violent protests have been triggered by the lack of elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which have caused a total of six fires and caused slight burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) said they were aware of 27 incidents related to devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "non-severe".
In his reply, the ministry called the "absolutely acquittable" postponement of the report by Apple.
The earthquake at the Marianne was warned at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Emergency Management Office of the Northern Marianne Islands, no damage was reported to the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of an ongoing tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Philippine police officer took hostage Hong Kong tourists after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 Rolando Mendoza rifle, he focused on tourists.
Many of the hostages have been saved, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and elders, were released immediately with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins went through his father's footsteps and took up his medical career.
After graduating from the hostess, in 1959 he joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight records.
His associates of wrestling also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Mona was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like you. A strong woman."
"Mona was as weird as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... we hope she's in a better place," was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey conducted on 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal elections, people opposed to the transition from Australia to the Republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that Australia must become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the survey participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
In contrast to the survey, 29% of respondents argue that Australia must become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% feel that it must never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meters free style and in three staff at the Commonwealth Games, but it accused several disturbances that led to doubt its physical form.
He could not take the drugs needed to overcome the pain because they are banned by the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known to this day.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that have led water and organic matter on earth, i.e. matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists wish to understand how the planets are formed, and in particular how the Earth was formed, having met with comets a long time ago.
Como, 53 years old, has been in charge since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he placed his signature on a law that makes marriage between people of the same sex legal.
According to him, speculations are nothing but "polluters and political idiots".
A candidacy for the Presidency is assumed in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of obsolete ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide more accurate information to pilots.
Additional transport is not being set up and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while parking for cars or exchanges are not available on site.
Fears related to the absence of means of transport have revealed the possibility of necessarily having the game played at closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published on Thursday in the magazine Science, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, United States, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was considered that the time needed for this process was much greater; this was due to the coupling between an endemic fin of Darwin, a strong geospiza, and the fringuel of the immigrant cactus, a Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable to be twisted and intertwined. It can be hammered or wrapped in sheet.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It has sometimes been used to decorate hand painted images in books called "mine codes" thanks to the possibility of being so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the red cabbage juice you can construct a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color according to whether the chemical element is acid or basic (alkaline).
The pH level of the chemical analysed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (PH letter).
Hydrogen ions mean protons whose electrons have been ripped away (as hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, stick them in a ball.
Between the humidity present on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange feeling and will form a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, in the houses of the mining towns of Crete and Santorini were discovered remains of sewerage networks.
Cabinets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes included in public bathrooms, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone away thousands of miles, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost immediately.
The launch of the satellite into space was made with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and visuals in part.
To transport a satellite or a telescope into space you need a high rocket more than 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is to have provided us with easier and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, they have made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium sized felines that feed on medium sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small feline (including free domestic cats) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every cat has and which allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social feline and live in numerous groups called branches.
The branches are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 separated from each other, and by a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The flock of lions acts in a very similar way to the flock of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is indeed surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other great feline), also with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not too well), swim, jump very long and exercise a pull force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the Panthera genus) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four feline are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a phrase of screamed and angry words.
The birds love to feed small animals. If possible, they go hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the birds follow and find the animals to eat (prede) thanks to the smell, watering on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move furtively. To hunt their prey, the birds blend with the surrounding environment and then plunge them over.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example if you move beyond a mountain chain or a river, or move to a new island, making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in an environment other than the one in which it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, in order to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
With the passing of time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it is increasingly less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different between them that they will no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb carbon dioxide from them (through inspiration).
Plants produce their own nutrition with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our houses from plants and produce our clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants the animals could not survive.
The mosaic was the superpredator of his age, and for this he feared nothing, except the other mosaics.
From its long falcons there were more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for whoever crossed its path there was no escape.
We don't know that for sure, but it may have the biforked language. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mossauri and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would appear familiar to us, the Roman banquets also provided for different strange or unusual courses, such as the boar, peacock, the candles and a kind of rodent called gargo.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women were eating while sitting on the chairs, rich men loved to feast together while lying on one side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for all gods, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurat, were built that became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no great forests, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was rarely populated. In the northern saghes it is said that Erik the Red gave her the name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although all countries "Scandians", the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the film "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is designed a map of the treasure.
However, this is false. Although something has been written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the written "Declaration of original independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down to the document.
Although it is certainly not known who wrote it, it is noted that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measure 29.75 inches per 24.5 inches) has been rounded up to be restored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only affixed as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had led the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had allied themselves with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940 the Allied invaded South France: this offensive action took the name "Operation Dragon".
The American forces and those of the Free French had freed the south of France in just two weeks and headed for Germany.
With civilization is a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civilis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in a way also defines the dimensions of society.
Cities-state are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means conveying knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural footprint through an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving important historical traces, not being so recognized as true and own civilizations.
During the war of independence, the thirteen were formed for the first time a weak central government, and the Congress was the only component, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial authority at national level, it was entrusted to the State authorities, often not collaborative, for the application of their acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax and duty laws between states.
In order to amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all the states was necessary, and they had so little consideration of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football national is, along with the German one, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports there are: football, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of the Japanese nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, we refer to Japan as a "archipelago", considered the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors passing there gradually recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Eastern Indies Dutch Company in 1624 established a base in the south-west part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation that concerned the production systems of Aboriginal cereals and taking Chinese arms to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under control by the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared province of the Qing Empire.
After having been defeated in the first Chinese-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty in 1895, thus yielding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island will remain under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site had been recovered, but restoration work is still under way.
The most common format in the world for fixed image photography, for example, is the 35 mm, the same of the most used film on the end of the analogue photography era.
It still occurs today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the formats of digital camera image sensors.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing for twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the family of APS formats) are equal or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often derised third-party rule is a simple guide that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in example).
At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was tempted to be under consideration.
Christian religion had acted as a glue between European States for over a thousand years, despite language differences and costume.
His omnipresent power has affected everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary reserves of the church exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain decided to set up a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy has proved effective: it envisaged the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite this block violating international law usually accepted and codified by many international treaties of the last two centuries.
Great Britain undermined international waters to prevent access of any vessel to entire sections of the ocean, and also put neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had given rise to a limited response, Germany expected a reaction similar to its indiscriminate underwater war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and horrors of the first world war, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Batchelor (his previous manager) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or any family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between the individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these times, fierce wars were lit up among many noblemen fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands died fighting to gain a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absoluteism to republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all men candidates, enabling the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since army classifications, instead of being based on the class, are now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution has also been a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Maometto was deeply interested in the issues that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave lies on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if there was knowledge of it. Once inside the cave, isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a large number of mountains around it. From within the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has arrived to our day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honour of the dead Pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of Kings in Egypt, hosts numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheope), various smaller tombs, various temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and families.
The indication "up arched" looks like a V and the indication "down arched" to a scratch or a square without the lower side.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start from the analamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc a stronger and more determined sound.
You may decide to add your custom pencil indications, but keep in mind that the signs of the archery you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the forced market King Louis XVI, in the grip of terror, left Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Mary Antonietta, to their two little children (11-year-old Maria Teresa and Louis Carlo, 4-year-old) and to Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep open the windows of their carriage.
At some point someone among the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism supported to conquer the Philippines were paid by Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay the taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds oscillated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains resulting from the exploitation protracted in the time of the Philippine people constituted profits at the basis of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars you need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The time when events took place is commonly called High Medieval, the period of European history covering the XI, XII and XIII century (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Middle Ages and followed by the Middle Ages, which was concluded by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or from technological imperative to the narrow sense that the fate of man is driven by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves a development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a greater percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new relief techniques for the care of injured persons.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time there have been uses, customs and culture related to this geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly in Paris, known today as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
His fame as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century his prestige was diminished, especially because the Crusaders returned carrying gifts like silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was touched in the period between the X and the XI century and the fourteenth century.
At first, clothing was influenced by the strong influence of the Byzantine culture of the East.
But the slowness of the lines of communication allows the spread of styles in the West to delay 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the Crusades, was the introduction of the buttons to tie the clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practised solely for the purpose of producing enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Sustainability farming is a simple system, usually of a biological type, which uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at obtaining the maximum from crops.
Historically most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures combine individuals with the same opinions, which do not feel represented by society standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of its members.
The characteristics that define as distinctive a subculture may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes modes, manners and argots.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialisation is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, as a result of misfortune, or because of intentional abuse, grew up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "ferals" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their parents themselves): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical menoration by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children could have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully reared by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference to man.
Project-based learning should make learning even simpler and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning mode, the more help for those who undertake a new learning experience, as can be the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but it is also the small assistant in the form of Microsoft Office graffiti.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and have the purpose of questioning, soliciting and explaining the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing alone.
Children are given in trust for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee nutrition, care and training, but happens to them.
We believe that trust represents a safe area for these children.
Our trust system should provide safe homes, loving trusting parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trust is supposed to satisfy all the unsatisfied needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together in itself some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, as important reasons for using the Internet, they suggest "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relations".
The use of video recording has enabled significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements of the duration of a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks explained how people unable to understand the language spoken because of brain damage are however able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even maintains that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the twentieth century the research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is removed from the expressed variability pool.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability forward and backwards between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive device similar to that of human beings it is difficult to meet its need for amino acids with the vegetable resources available in the savanna.
Moreover, failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowing down growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and vegetables, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In the light of all this, it should not be surprising that our ancestors themselves have solved their "protein problem" in a certain way as they do today's savanna chimpanzees.
The interruption of sleep is the intentional awakening process that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice using a relatively quiet awakening to lead you to a state of consciousness, without waking up completely.
If you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on biorithm provide for the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force them to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
Less tension, more positive is the existing vital force. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and mating.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is hampered only by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayan rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of omnicomprehensive love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (energy of lighting) by using yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantra and visualizations.
The Deity Yoga is the focal point of Tibetan meditation. By depicting various deities you clean the energy channels, activate the chakras and develop the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the system, procedural and cultural conflicts, led to the breakup between the two countries.
After two years since the end of the war, former allies had become enemies; so began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years and would indeed be fought by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence had already been unearthed; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge head.
These plans, however, were immediately obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Taking advantage of ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods through the oceans.
The task of the marines has always been to guarantee the country the preservation of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time contrasting the ability of the enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War. During the battle, Americans tried to move men and goods through the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German military navy, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the opportunity to conquer Britain, as it had in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago on Zagros mountains in Iran.
They began to be raised by cultures and tribes of ancient times to have milk, wool, meat and skin readily available.
The domestic goats were usually raised in herders left free to move on the hills or in other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (like the shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
Already in the 16th century in England the wagons were built.
Although they were simply formed from parallel wooden axes, the wagons, if compared to the slightly more crashing roads of the period, allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossings were introduced relatively soon to keep track in position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would have been more efficient if they had had a iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, even though the iron caused greater wear of the car's wooden wheels.
Finally, the wooden wheels left the place to those in iron. In 1767 they made their appearance the first rails completely in iron.
The first means of transport that man has known were the legs. Human beings have started walking in an erect position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "man erect").
His predecessor, the australopitico, did not walk normally erect.
Specialization signs for biped walk are present in the fossils of Australopieco dating back to 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent future suffering we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and also activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and turn it off.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, while the problems have increased because of the overcrowding and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on 4 July, a draft manuscript signed by the President of the John Hancock Congress and by Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printery of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
The night was produced between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "The Dunlap posters".
The document was read publicly for the first time on 8 July in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the commission was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which made her read to her room troops in New York on 9 July, while a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 edges of Dunlap still known are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. Those are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs due to feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that combine them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with scales and claws, lay the eggs and walk on the two rear legs.
Finally, the manipulation of coded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can only have one of the two values, namely 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary or bit numbers.
Internal poisoning may not be obvious immediately. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of a drug container or open chemical substances.
Check whether there are first aid instructions for that specific poison on the label.
The term acaro is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bedbugs, insects that have strongly adapted themselves to become man's parasites.
Both killer and bedbugs are nestless, that is, adapted to living in their nest or in their guest's home.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) records some 400,000 known cases, placing first among neurological diseases affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a pathology that affects the central nervous system, which is part of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double compared to males.
A couple may decide that growing up a child is not in their own interests, or that of their own child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption, natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But this is not only about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; also asking questions and making observations allows to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend in a decisive way on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, relative to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even without external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a battery.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophagus with radioactive phosphorus or the bacterial protein with radioactive sulphur.
The mutations may have a number of different effects based on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and depending on whether the cells concerned belong to the germ line.
The mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that take place elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism calls on people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about Borneo oranges.
Every morning, people leave small country to go to work by car, crossing other people whose place of work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic even, everyone is somehow connected to a private car-based transport system, which at the same time supports.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, almost all of which complain.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into ruins.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they thrown out every day? Are they engineers who design them that are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
The "Traffic Flow" (i.e. "traffic flow") is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and of the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the conduct of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so in turn traffic flows tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented generally mathematically.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to stand out for the flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily to the enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small enfracts to hide from predators.
Among all existing insects today, the only ones who are unable to fold the wings are the dragonflies and the ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For someone was right, but many others believed otherwise, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, why don't we have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries a water quantity equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, with a width that in some points reaches six miles.
The total 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Rio delle Amazoni.
The main river Rio delle Amazoni is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It pours the waters of thousands of smaller effluents.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never overcome in terms of the greatness and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanting, admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is made up of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and that with the least population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the daily language of use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive tools.
According to philosopher Aristotle, everything consists of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These actually look more like the four states of matter, i.e.: solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, it also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Note that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metal. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys made up of minimum quantities of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could get to the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil has thus proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to an increasingly less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to get close to a temperature.
We can only ask ourselves which fate will have the keyboard when something new comes.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a core with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission pump.
In practice it is like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. So, further dividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break up in the presence of a low push or nothing.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farther side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This has facilitated surface lava climbing.
Content theories are focused on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people present certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what is involved in some people and push them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the theories on the most widespread content are the Theory of Maslow's needs hierarchy and the Two Factor Theory of Herzberg.
In general, when managers begin to run their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibility.
At the very opposite, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels he has to change the entire operation of the team and do it himself.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often leads to differences between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of contact point for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than the members of the conventional teams, because meetings can take place according to the various time zones, which may not be included in local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is the one which sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to face the long process leading to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason for implementing the concepts of organisational learning can be innovation.
When you are able to use all available resources effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and engineering can emerge.
Consequently, the collaboration path within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order for an organization to be innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to cognition investigation. The research area becomes more restricted and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain disease and behavior is the basis of scientific research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes that have never been observed before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite a strong scientific connotation, the IA represents a branch of the very important IT that deals with the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on IA includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require smart behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, vocal and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various applications software for home computers and video games.
The tours are a fundamental part of teaching. Teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext to share experiences and travel reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are stored online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. In fact, often their first experiences with blogs are marked by an uncareful grammar and spelling, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgment the author of the blog commits to improving writing.
The blogs also "enforce students to become more aware of the moment around them."The need to feed the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's suggestive and bilingual capital, rich in art galleries and museums that tell about the past and the present of the country.
To the south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and uncontaminated beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the views of foreigners.
The larger areas to the north are rarely populated, some of these are almost unsaturated wild strips.
If we compare the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States, the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a self-sustaining continent.
Almost all smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent or associated with France.
In the Arab lands the Arabs also took Islam, which took a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by Sahel, while to the south and west it borders with the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: It is recommended that everyone declare that they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one of the look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider to be an inconvenience, and that it is not unusual to be followed, gripped by the arm, etc.
Have the strength to refuse men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenides.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name of White House, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather items, narghilè and so much chimbalerie, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the volcano Nyiragongo destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those of the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document well before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see African mountain gorillas.
You can use a wedding (taxi-motocycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short run.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" ended up becoming an exotic and distant metaphor.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites which are in danger, due to the threat posed by the sands of the desert.
In the special of Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its more arabic touch than African, the city stands out clearly from the other parts of the country.
The Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located in north-eastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north bordering Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides support to a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As for all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are provided for conservation and entry into the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, since it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the whole territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a sparking bar chart, even more evident because it is framed by Victoria Harbour waters.
To enjoy Hong Kong's best views, leave the island and visit Kowloon's waterfront in front.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong has focused on the well-fed lands of the northern coast, densely populated.
This is the place that British colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past of this land, this is a good point from which to go.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal range of mangroves worldwide. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared heritage of humanity by UNESCO. The forest part included in Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps: there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gange plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of marshy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wild fauna; in the area it is estimated the presence of 400 real Bengal tigers and about 30,000 maculated deer.
Buses start from the interdepartmental bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those directed east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since bus services between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust Japanese small buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a broken bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, in Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guyana.
Its two tralices have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two wide courses 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to the traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully functioning.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in today's East Paraguay. They were semi-mad hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payagua, who lived on hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Indie Province", was born in the 16th century since the meeting between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunción, which took place in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its indigenous peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las Cañitas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Association Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falklands Pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of British sterling (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands. Stanley can often also be paid with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on peripheral islands they do not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the fallland currency outside the islands, so you change the money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of Ecuador, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
The winter can be deceptively cold: the temperatures rarely come below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no "dry" and "pious" seasons defined: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to the sight of man, fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
No matter how many docile they may look: bison, alks, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they do not maintain an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an appropriate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing food with you or cooking with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there occurred the sadly known naval stable of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Almost 200 US and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamaese Lealofi III, the chief.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the North Shore Pacific Ocean (in the North Harbour District) extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shadow of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitetata.
These are beaches suitable for families sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide range of shops. You can take the bathroom safely.
The most popular local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You may have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could better deal with the trip.
The water in the tap of the place is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the coffee 'flat white' is born from a foreign idea. The 'expresso' is the black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (non foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral barrier and accidents for one of these causes on the coral barrier are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, stick to directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The Cubemeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period you can only find occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to keep themselves away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not living them actively in the ocean.
When booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he has reached his destination.
Travel agencies often sign conventions with certain hotels, but it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer breakfast packages, airport transfers or even flight+hotel combined packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to provide you with additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted before the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some musical festivals, most participants decide to sit on the ground, considering this as a crucial element of experience.
To be close to the centre of the action you need to arrive soon and get a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stage, there may be sections of the festival where the music continues until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, since the ice crossing causes quite annoying noise for those who are most exposed.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include the time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa exemption (check the conditions).
In general, casinos do everything to increase as much time and money as possible spent by their guests. Generally, there are no windows, no watches, and exits can be difficult to find.
Usually they offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the mood of the guests out of their way so that they can stay.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the ability to judge and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive to high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On frozen and snowy carts, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive like when you are on the clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in a very short time it can fall so much snow to keep you trapped.
The precipitation and snow reefs, or the formation of ice or condensation on vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safari are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the holiday of many visitors.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips carried out by land, especially in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so a normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, ghepards and leopards are sometimes shy and that is why you can observe them better with binocular.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "safari excursions", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations scattered throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. In fact, the first Olympics had been held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the return was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary between them, however, most of the cancellation policies linked to coronovirus, at the end of March 2020, do not reach until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for events will be between 2,500 and 130,000, while normal tickets will cost about 7,000.
Drying wet clothes can facilitate drying. Many hotels offer the use of iron and iron axis, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear stretched socks, you can try with a hair dryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid restrictions or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is appropriate to evaluate the purchase of water packaged inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come in contact with animal parasites that are not spread in their regions of origin.
Paraxites may damage food, provoke irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmitted poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people with force are usually not qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers headed to countries with high taxes sometimes can save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway between Point Marion and Fairmont features the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country streets, it is recommended to keep your eyes open, as they dominate steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves.
The exposed speed limits are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict compliance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of mobile telephone service is much higher than that in other routes of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German sweets are pretty good and in Bavaria are somewhat tasty and varied, similar to those in neighbouring Austria more south.
Fruit sweets are a classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German kiln cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Most popular cakes are often accompanied very well by a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste sweets small but rich in taste can focus on those who, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
The curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be presented both "dry" and "wet", based on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan for curry in the hinterland regions yogurt is normally used; in southern India and in some other coastal region of the subcontinent is more used coconut milk.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the Indonesian cuisine term is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specifications, the term generally indicates the foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of simple-preparation dishes; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Japanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The staffes are supports for the foot of the knight and are hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present security problems for the possibility that the rider's feet will keep you trapped.
If a child is thrown by a horse but has a foot stuck in the staff, he could be dragged by the horse that runs away. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that can be taken.
First of all, most knights wear riding boots equipped with heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Afterwards, some saddles, especially the English ones, have inserted safety bars, which allow a leather shelf to pull off the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there are huge walls and granite cliffs.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Scalators from every part of the world continually trace new paths on its walls, potentially infinite.
Sports on the snow in free descent, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and provide for snow slide thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski booms" (the ski abandons), which devote whole vacation periods to ski activity in a particular area.
The principle at the base of the ski is very ancient: the first rupestrian paintings with the representation of humans that ski date back to 5000 BC!
The alpine skiing as sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called out-piste, ski mountaineering or trekking on skis.
It is connected, although it usually does not include them, touring skiing or skiing, which are practised on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and shoes.
Think of the ski track as a path similar to the hiking one.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover distances in any way greater than those you walk, but only very rarely will you reach the speed of the cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but formed by many independent countries. Normally, to travel across more countries it would need to apply for visa and pass through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area works rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to cross passport controls again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes a piece of antique fabric. Some tax agencies consider this an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition differs geographically from the age limit that may be lower, as in North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar objects produced in series.
The breeding of reindeer is an important source of support for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also at the base of many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi were always involved in large-scale reindeer breeding; some lived on fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of Sámi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roman people, the word "Pyro" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a warning to travellers is issued for the destination you will visit, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or your insurance in case of cancellation of the trip.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than yours, but bear in mind that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations that are different from Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The views reported are often superficial, generic and simple compared to the most detailed information available elsewhere.
"Averse weather conditions" is the general expression indicating any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social damage or loss of lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in every part of the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, precipitation above the norm and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to temporal, tornado, marine trumpets and cyclones.
Among the meteorological phenomena of high regional and seasonal intensity are the torments, the snow bubbles, the ice storms and the sand storms.
Travellers are advised to inform themselves of the adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect the planning of the trip.
Any plans to visit a potentially considerable country as a war zone must support vocational training.
Searching on the Internet 'Corso sul ambientes ostili' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in a much more detailed way, usually using practical experience.
A course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travellers who are planning a surgery to change sex abroad must ensure that they have the documents valid for the return trip with them.
The intention of governments to issue passports with no indication regarding sex (X) or updated documents to match a name and a desired type is variable.
Similarly variable is the availability of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Security inspections have also become much more scrupulous in the post-September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transgenders should not expect to pass checks without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
The risacca currents consist of the return flow of the waves that break on the beach, often near a coral barrier or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the flow of return is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can be formed towards the open sea.
Most of the deaths occur due to fatigue in the attempt to swim counter-current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you're out of the current, coming back to swim won't be more difficult than normal.
Try to find an area where you are not likely to be trapped again, or evaluate whether to wait for relief, according to your skills and if you have been notified.
The shock to return occurs in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a shorter "moon of honey" phase), it lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their country of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you will be adapted to the new culture and you will have lost some of the uses of your culture of origin.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely that you have met patients and understanding people, aware that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were also necessary for those entering the country.
The show of pyramid sounds and lights is the most interesting in the area for children.
Before the show begins, you will be able to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Usually you always feel the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a storybook.
The Sphing becomes the background and the storyteller of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by several countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the boiler of a still active volcano filled with water from origin to a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reemerge and form the Ellsworth mountains, a chain of 360 km cut into two by Minnesota ice.
The northern part, known as the Sentinella Chain, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massiccio, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only alternative.
A satellite phone does not usually constitute a substitute for the mobile phone, because to call you you have to find yourself outdoors with the visible debris up to the satellite.
The service is often used by sports boats, including sports boats, as well as missions that need data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about the connection to this service.
One of the most popular options among those who plan to take a Sabbath year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly widespread among neo-diplomates, since they can take a year before they start university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a course abroad in the Sabbath year can actually increase the possibility of taking up higher education than returning to their country of origin.
The inclusion of these educational programmes usually requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing. In the "Land of the thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
The nautical is Finland's national pastime, where you count a boat every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa will not be required for the descent to the ground (from 2009 onwards) using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, moreover the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can scare people of all ages and of any condition, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest toward other things.
For some people to understand a little bit how planes work and what happens during a flight can be useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or on the fact that they don't have control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller societies problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would have required days for discharge and customs.
The only way to get it to you faster would be to send it as a storage baggage. And this is where you come into play, since air company regulations do not allow you to ship it without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the obvious way is to pay off a beautiful figure for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for travel to Business and up to eleven times the rate for those in first class!
In general, on flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first-class seats or in business classes.
Airlines know well that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at destination, and therefore apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very popular.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past has been the theatre of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and its own currency, but not recognised by any United Nations member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox one.
Smirne is the third city of Turkey by size, with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient city of Smyrna develops on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although in the city there is an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, large avenues, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centres are lined by the characteristic roofs of red tiles, the 18th century market and mosques and ancient churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views on the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the church sanctuary, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
One half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily reachable. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops in Cabo da Roca.
Always north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), place of famous Marian apparitions around the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a common pit, and has an almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world population.
There are still many men and women who have survived in these places, and many others who have seen their beloved murders or have worked to death, both Jews and non - Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid beating on the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid distorting these places by embracing structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known almost by everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used for public transport and other services.
In metro, ordinary ads are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians are famous for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get well in Paris continues to be to be to behave best, relating as a "well-educated" person. This will greatly facilitate your movements.
The rough outward appearance of Parisians will fade quickly if you get rid of some good basic ways.
The national park of the Plitvice Lakes is rich in forests, mostly beech, fish and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, there is a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a wide variety of animal and bird species.
In these places there live rare species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and cedar cock, alongside several other most widespread animal species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most of the monasteries make available the stylus for the women who arrive to you unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will gain a smile from the monk or the nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants under their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts may not feel at your ease. For men, a unique size for everyone!
Major cuisine, such as that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa with Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments found, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "Lei", always begin with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantive form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most of the words are spoken as written.
The main letters to be careful are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows.
Also make sure to pronounce in a different way "r" and "rr": dear means blessed, while carriage means carriage.
The Persian has a relatively simple grammar and more often regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Roman language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can reach the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore must not be studied separately.
Today, premodern observers are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden period did not represent a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily reachable than those built in modern times.
Most of the modern telescopes for research are huge structures in undisturbed areas where weather conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept was originally from China, where it preferred the flowering of plums.
In Japan, the first festivals for cherry blossoming were organized by the emperor alone and by other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to even take "only" a sample.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy-to-turn city; you can buy almost anything when you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to make accounts with the hot (always) and the strong sun (sooner, when the sky is quiet).
Some buses also head north toward Hebron, where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland water courses can be an excellent theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can make a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can navigate on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the routes of hiking trails and well-known cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions related to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in the Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
A tradition plans to spend Easter night staying awake in an outdoor place to admire the dawn.
Of course there are Christian theological explanations at the basis of this tradition, but it could well be a pre - Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the most traditional churches, a Easter Eve is celebrated on Saturday night of Easter weekend, with the congregations that often start the ceremony at midnight to celebrate Christ’s resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals were unable to face the journey. This made the giant turtle the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats have been introduced to Galapagos.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you will be able to experience polar night, when the sun stays under the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to watch the boreal dawn, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since territories are rarely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners tend to be used to.
The office clothing is normally made up of jacket and tie or fitter and is addressed to colleagues with the surname or professional title.
It is of crucial importance to the harmony of the workplace, because it gives importance to the group's commitment rather than to praise individual achievements.
Workers should often receive the blessing of their superiors on every decision, and they are expected to follow the instructions without asking questions.
