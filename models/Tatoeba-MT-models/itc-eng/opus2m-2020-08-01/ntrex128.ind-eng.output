The members of the Majelis (AM) Welsh worry if they ‘look like a muppets doll’.
There is concern among some AMs about a suggestion that they should be referred to as MWPs.
This arose because there was a plan to turn the name of the Majestic into Parliament Welsh.
The AMs throughout the political spectrum worry if it can invite excitement.
An AM labor party said that his group was concerned, "It's called a union with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the council (AM) said that his group as one unit, felt "unhappy" and had suggested some alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open thinking" about changing names, but judged that this is a blast of MWP's abbreviation to be Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is rendered like the letter u in English Yorkshire.
The Council's current commission has established laws to introduce the name, saying: "The final decision of any explanation of the term for AM is of course a problem for the members themselves."
Wales' decision 2017 gave the Wales Council to change its name.
In June, the Commission published public consultation results on a known proposal for broad support to refer to a council as Parliament Welsh.
Regarding the problem called AM, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Members of Parliament Welsh), but MWP options get the most support in public consultation.
The AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could dissuade the principal, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the draft laws for those changes within a few weeks.
This reform will include other changes on how to work, including the rules disqualified for AMs and the committee's planning.
The AM will get a final voice on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the invitations.
The Macedonians went to give a vote on the referendum on changing the country's name
The voter will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia Republic."
The high voter was held in an effort to resolve disputes for a decade with Greek neighboring countries, which also had a province named Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the neighboring northern country shows a confession to her territory and has repeatedly rejected the European Union and NATO membership offer.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ibanov, a voice-voting opponent for a change of name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, felt that the change of the name was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St.Martin's bell bells were undivided when the churches in Harlem were in trouble
"Historically, the old men I'd talk to say first there was a bar and church in every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, none."
He said that all those bars could be understood.
"People socialize in another way" right now, he said.
"Bar is no longer a community living room around where people regularly visit them."
Likewise with the church, he was concerned that money from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would return again from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could be replaced with the apartment building with condominiums filled with people who would not help to keep the sacred places around it.
"The nature of the people who will buy condominium in these buildings is white," he said, "and so it will speed up the day when these churches are closed simultaneously because it is impossible for those who move to these condominiums to become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became the city of metropolis of black people - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
The black congregation that had been worshipped in the surrounding area had taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation under the leadership of President John Howard, who led a brilliant shopboy on 125th, the main road to shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The 1939 fire caused the building to be severely damaged, but when the parish people of Johnson planned to rebuild, they built a tower bell.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his replacement in St. Martin proudly called the bell tower "Lonceng poor people"
An expert who rang the tower bell in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "a non-replaceable historical instrument."
One expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also noted that this is the first tower bell in the world played by black musicians, Dionysio A. Lind who switched to ring a larger tower bell in the 18-year-old Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't take his place.
What has happened in Santo Martin for the past few months is an architectural and complicated contractor story, some of which have been brought by regular church leaders, and others brought by the episcopal movement.
The vestry - the body of the bishops, which is made up of the leaders of the public - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the "will try to burden the costs" on the vestry parties, although the vestry is not involved in the architectural recruiting and contractor sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners are complaining about the lack of transparency by the party.
Sharks hurt a 13-year-old in lobster dives in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobster in California in the lobby season opening, at the expense of an officer.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in the Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then rowing together to help draw him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a thrill after catching lobster, but then he "appreciated" that the boy screamed, "I'm biting!
I'm bitten!'
His entire bones were torn apart," Hammel said that he realized when he had caught the boy.
"I screamed to everyone out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flying to Rady's Child Hospital in San Diego, where he was handled in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media conference that a shark had been seen in that area a week earlier, but it was classified as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim had a severe wound to the upper part of his body.
Authorities closed access to the coast from the Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 shark species in this region, but most of them are considered harmless.
The Sciencebury Plan breaks the English beauty market
Sciencebury takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with kios-kios beauty style toserba style handled by specialized assistants.
As part of the substantial push towards the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling fashion products and household equipment down, the larger beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more shops next year if it proved successful.
Investment in beauty is a hunting ground for supermarkets to use racks that used to be used as a place for TVs, microwaves, and household equipment.
Sciencebury said that it would double the amount of offers of beauty up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current frame of brand started with L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with a blizzard area as found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also reopened the range of the boutique makeup so that most of its products would be friendly to vegans - something that the young buyers are increasingly interested in.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume wine grower will test the competition at two Sainsbury stores, the first one opened in Croydon.
Online shopping and switching on daily food supplies in small amounts in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive head of sciencebury, has said that the gerais will become more and more like mall when the chain supermarkets are trying to fight back the teachers like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and without food.
Sciencebury has placed Argos' movements in hundreds of shops and has also introduced some Habitat since they bought those two charities two years ago, which said it has supported daily food sales and made a more profitable claim.
The previous supermarket effort to renew the beauty and pharmacy department ends with failure.
Sciencebury tested statues with Boots in early 2000, but the same work ended after there was a disagreement about how to share the profits of the chemical store in the supermarket.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was told that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding various fancy leather care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director Sainsbury, said: "We've changed the look and nuances on the beauty kiosks to improve the mood for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand series is designed so that according to all needs, the attractive environment and the comfortable location indicates that at this time we are an attractive destination that challenges the long-running way of shopping."
Peter Jones "grow" after Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a £11 million deal
The Dragons Den star, Peter Jones went ‘annoyably’ after TV carrier Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a living business deal worth £11 million to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage the brand of household equipment and their accessories, Truly.
This couple's business is similar to Gwyneth Pavrew's Goop brand.
This Morning's 37-year-old bringer uses his Instagram account to announce that he's out.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' star" Den, Petes Jones is madly attracted at the last moments, from their lucrative lifestyle business -- to focus on his bigger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources state that Jones was so "gold" when the golden girl admitted during the rendezvous meeting on Tuesday at her commercial government office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - means she no longer had enough time to devote herself to the brand of household equipment and their accessories, Truly.
Their business has been likened to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Petrow and expected to double Willoughby's wealth worth £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his holiday homes,
One source says: "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be the long-term future, which would make it last for decades to come.
His decision to back down really impressed everyone involved.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, really close to launch time.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe the travel of this Morning, one of the most expensive British stars, can cost the company up to millions of dollars because of massive investment in product form, from pillows and candles to clothes and household equipment, and the potential for further postponement.
And this can mean the end of a long-standing friendship relationship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and Tara Capp's wife for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52 - year - old Jones joined the head in March.
These couples are on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand-name ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV carrier named I'm A Celebrity.
A fellow close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speaking seriously ‘and then we fell in love’
He's joking about the criticism he'll get from the news media because he makes comments that some people consider to be "non-presidential" and has been very positive against North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump says with his funny "new-reader" voice.
"I didn't hand over anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting twice after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for North Korea's reprisal.
But the negotiations on embalming have been stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Council on Saturday that North Korea did not see an "appropriate response" from the United States against the initial movement of North Korea's weapons.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued its intended punishment for pressure.
Trump is more optimistic in his speech sequence.
"We do our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight North Korea.
Millions will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship,"
He said that his success in mending relationships with Kim had led to positive results - stopping rocket experiments, helping to free the hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing towards the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia’s Tsunami and Storm Destroyed an Island, Killed Hundreds
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of the Lombok lost their homes, there was no national disaster statement, as a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've made it clear that they're not asking for international help, so this is a bit challenging," Mrs. Summon said.
While Save The Children is setting up a team to go to the Palu, it's still unclear whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a national disaster relief agency speaker, said that the Indonesian official was reviewing the situation in the Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute aid.
In view of the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, this country is still not ready to deal with the anger of nature.
While a tsunami shelter had been built in Aceh, it was not a public sight on the other shore.
There were no tsunami warning sirens in the Palu, despite the warning of danger, it was likely to have contributed to the victim’s existence.
At the best of times, travel between many Indonesian islands was challenging.
Natural disaster makes logistics even more complicated.
The apical hospital that has been placed in Lombok to care for the earthquake victims is heading to the Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach a new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to broken Indonesian infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on road and rail construction.
But lack of funds has disrupted the government of Mr. Joko as he faced the election next year.
Father Joko also faced pressure from the ongoing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where Muslim members of the majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes when Muslim and Christian mobs fought on the streets, using dams, bows, arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge put in a floating goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea at the Premier League with a score in a minute in 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside Chelsea gag when his team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before kicking it into a long pole.
The ball rolled high over the glove when the ball rolled up to the right corner over the net.
The ball finally fell past the Arrizabalaga that jumped and fell into the net.
"That's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just make a kick."
Chelsea led with a score of 1-0 at the first half after the original Belgian player Eden Hazard scored in the mid-25s.
The Blue attacker gave Mateo Kovacic feedback to the game, before turning around the middle line and running fast into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gives bait and runs in the middle line.
He then made a perfect kick, led Hazard to the gang.
Hazard managed to cross the opponent's back and kick the ball at the edge of the ghetto with the kicks left, pass the Liverpool Kiper Alisson Becker.

The death of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
Death victims of an earthquake and the Indonesian tsunami had increased to 832, at the end of the country’s disaster agency on Sunday morning.
Many are reported trapped in the ruins of buildings that were destroyed by the 7.5 - scale earthquake of Richter that swept through on Friday and triggered a 20 - foot - high wave, says Sutopo Purwo, an agency speaker in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which is inhabited by more than 380,000 people, is filled with collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32 years old, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Murder investigation has been done after a woman's body was found at Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John Road, at 7.55 in the morning with a few stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police have asked people around to see or hear something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "Research is still at an early stage, but I ask everyone around John's road in Birkenhead to see or hear something suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may record something on the flight cameras to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
The police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the local Birkenhead and he was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt sure that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still going on as the police have said, they're in the process of telling the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just returned to his apartment, but told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
That man can't say anything when he finds out what happened.
Now the citizens are being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed to return.
A police officer's hearing is telling someone that all areas are now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the scene in tears.
He's always saying, "This is really horrible."
By 2:00 p.m., two vans were in line and the others were outside.
A number of officers stand in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone who has information requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, phone 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on number 0800 555 111 by quoting log 247 on September 30.
The statue of Parlemen Cromwell became the last memorial of the rewriting of history.
His expulsion would be a poetic justice for the destruction of al-Taliban against many British cultural and religious artifacts by the fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's community describes Mr. Crick's advice as "foolish" and "working to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: "This is not to be avoided in the current debate about the destruction of the statues, that figure Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster palace will be targeted.
The British brother's war iconoclasm was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell family would have been sacrificed for Thomas' ancestor actions in the previous century.
The extraordinary representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft was a 19th-century evidence of opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that still believed many still deserve to celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more than today in the late 19th century, as a parliament defender against external pressure, in the case of the kingdom of course.
Whether it's a fully accurate representation, it's still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
which certainly is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the development of the next nation, and Cromwell is a sociable individual representing one side of the difference.
Indeed, he is a guardian.
Killer Pigs Destroying Chinese Farmers Until Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to the local media report.
The man, identified only by the name of his trademark "Yuan", was found dead with severed arteries, covered in blood near a pig cage at the Liupanshui province market Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
She was reported to have gone with her cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the pig stable door near him had been opened.
He said that in the pig cage there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensics studies confirm that a male pig weighing 550 pounds has persecuted the farmer until he died, based on a report.
"Betic my cousin bleeds and destroys," said the cousin who was known for the marga "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man was neither of Yuan's nor his cousins.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was already locked up to prevent anyone from attacking, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the reported market authority are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, pig assault cases have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a severe man’s injury.
10 years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds grabbed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife was afraid and expelled the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but blood scents can act as "a trigger".
"They're just playing games.
They're biters, so curious to know... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's storm brings heavy rain to the west of the United States.
As expected, the storm of Rosa weakened as it moved above the cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa would cause a flood in all parts of Mexico’s northern and western United States to come a few days later.
Rosa has a wind at a speed of 85 mph, storm category 1, starting at 5 a.m. on Sundays of the East Region, and is 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa may have moved north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Palung began to form on the Pacific Ocean and moved east, to the West Coast of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain up to 10 inches in part of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture interacting with the approaching bags will create massive rains in the West of Asia for a few days to come.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris stream and possibly lands along the desert.
Low tropical moisture will cause the rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is estimated that 2 to 4 inches [2 to 4 inches] of rain will fall in some parts of the West God, especially in most of Arizona.
The flooding may occur with a rapidly deteriorating condition because of the widespread tropical rain.
It is not recommended to explore the desert by walking for the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the tide to swell to a harsh river and the storms will carry strong local winds and dust.
A pellet approaching will cause heavy local rains to part of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall over half an inch is enough to allow, which can cause small debris to flow and the road becomes slippery.
It will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before it becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will extend to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great temperature changes throughout the U.S. when the Arctic gets colder, but the tropical regions remain warm enough.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in the short distance.
There is an accurate example of the dramatic temperature difference throughout the U.S. region on Sunday.
There was a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the remaining summer heat will be formed and spread again.
Most of the U.S. region in the middle and east is expected to start warmer in October at a speed of 80s from the South Plain to the eastern parts of the sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate estimates show a high opportunity for temperatures above average for the U.S. east until mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by the so-called Great Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that was suspected in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political gap continues, with publishers running a regular event to report an unexpected event at the last minute of Friday: A deal that Senator Arizona Jeff Flake had made for the FBI to do a one-week investigation on the charge.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was getting drunk and trying to take off her clothes at the middle school party upstairs.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
There is a possibility that over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company calculates average viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for another network broadcasting this is not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has difficulties in counting the number of people who witness him in the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the number of viewers that is almost the same as playoff football or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose viewers' opinions strongly support the Kavanaugh show, superior to all networks with an average of 5.69 million audiences throughout the congregation all day, says Nielsen.
ABC holds second position with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest remains high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican Party office issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, being shouted at by a cheerleader when he tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee.
He's standing down for a few minutes when he's being kicked off a maki, broadcasted directly at CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power when there are many helpless women."''
Flake said that his office had made a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee.
Cable TV and broadcast network all directly enveloped a few hours later, when the Justice Committee will choose to file a Kavanaugh call to the entire Senate for vote.
But Flake said he would only do that with the understanding that the FBI would look into the charges against the candidate for a week in the future, as the Democrat minority has asked.
Flake has been confirmed by some conversation with his friend, Senator Democracy Chris Coons.
After talking to the Coons and a couple of senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has strength, since it's clear that the Republican party won't have a voice to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses criticism of "political play" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "politically playing" with the future of Britain and damaging national interests, of his plan to leave the European Union, in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews showing it on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed an attack on what he called Chequers for Brexit's plan, saying that the proposal about England and the EU that had to collect one another's tariffs was "it's absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police caught Dyteon Simpson suspect in the death of LSU players.
The police have captured a suspect on a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-rate murder, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The officer released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his eyeglasses during the fight.
The police found those glasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson DNA on the stuff, the WAFB CBS affiliate reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he claimed he had made a fatal shot at Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The East Baton Rouge parish office released an earlier report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head to the neck.
The department is grateful for the bailout of Louisiana State Police, state police criminal labs, Southern University police and citizens around to assist in the investigation that leads to arrest.
LSU Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement officer for "delict and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 then.
Six feet tall lives in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The average point he was 5.6 and soaked up to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said his team felt "breakdown" and "surprised" with Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," says Wade.
Fire mounts tearing ashes in Mexico City
The ashes that came out of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached southern areas around Mexico’s capital.
National Disaster Prevention Center warns Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes after activity increases in the ditch and registered there are 183 emissions of gas and ash within a period of more than 24 hours.
It watched over and over again with applause.
Pictures on social media show a thin layer of ash stuck on the front glass of the car in the neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity on a volcano that is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital city since the 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
This Fire Mountain has been known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
The police beat up with the Catalan separatist approaching the election of independence celebration.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-freedom demonstration against anti-Huru-hara police, and when thousands joined the rival demonstration to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarization vote on separation.
A group of pro-separatist masks held by anti-wheat police threw them with eggs and threw powder paints, thus creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would usually be filled by tourists.
The dispute also occurred later that day with some police using their sticks to control the dispute.
For a few hours pro-freedom groups shout "Don't forget, no forgiveness" in front of the show of the workers' union shouting, "Longup Spanish."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, the local press reported.
The tension remained high in this free - oriented region, one year after the referendum of October 1 that was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalan separatist.
The voters chose to be free, even though the number of electors was low with some who opposed the separation and most of them were biased.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote on the GST throughout the region in a fierce battle.
Pro-freedom groups have camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separate protest with his wife said he no longer hoped about Catalonia's prospect of independence.
"Then we went through one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry about their choice, but now we're trapped," he said.
Despite the success of a vital victory in a few regional elections last December, Catalan pro- independence parties have fought to maintain this year's momentum despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in exile or in custody waiting for the trial, for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded protests with his cell phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting nervous," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned for pre-trials since the end of last year, announced that he would run in the election of the European Parliament next year.
"To stand as candidates for European elections is the best way to call for decline in the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car

A crosshole bow may also have been shot towards the car at some point.
The goal that Menga wrote has given a victory for Livingston over Rangers with a score of 1-0
Dolly's first goal for Livingston is to ensure the victory
Livingston's victory led the Rangers to fire Steven Gerrard out of his position as the manager of the Hebox club, for defeat in 18 games.
The Dolly Menga attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is equal to Hibernian's second order.
The Gerrard side remains without victory in the Premiership of this season and facing the leader of Hearts who is eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Previously, Rangers had you fast Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their invincible record in division into six games, while Holt's coach's head still scored defeat since Kenny Miler's replacement last month.
Livingston lost opportunity against a sloppy guest team
Holt's team should have been way superior before they scored a goal, with the precision of those who gave Rangers a variety of difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his effort to miss across the gutter's face, then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after launching in and facing Craig Halkett's protection across the gutter.
Homeowners were content to let Rangers play the lead, knowing that they could make it difficult for the coming team to find out about the dead ball.
And that's how to produce a very important goal.
Rangers broke free kicks and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in to help Menga, who got a turn and scored from the middle of the field.
At that stage, Rangers have dominated the rule but realizes that the defense of the house cannot be breached and that Liam Kelly's Kiper is totally undisturbed,
The pattern continued until the second round, although Alfredo Morelos managed to lure Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was harassed by the legs of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow were far removed due to another Livingston game tactic.
The attack continued to come to Livingston's glove and constantly avoided, while two criminal claims--after Halkett's challenge on Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for handball--was rejected.
Livingston's Phenomenal - analysis
BBC Scotland Alaska Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
To a man, they're amazing, they keep beyond hope in this ever - increasing track.
Their style of play and personal almost hasn't changed since they came back to the top board, but great credit has to be given to Holt for how he strengthened the team since he arrived.
He has so many giants.
Captain Halkett is very big, leading a well-organized defense, while making Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall remain alert as the game unfolds.
Nevertheless, Rangers lack inspiration.
Whatever they did at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not very good - only once they could break the formation of the side of the house - and it was a warning to Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan found a variety of reactions in Cologne.
There was a smile and a fork in the blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany - which aims to repair relations between NATO allies.
They argue about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkish entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police mentioned security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan pros - many of them Kurds - also voiced, scolded both, Erdogan's policy and German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The resistance protest describes the opposition to the existence of a comedian who was hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as a dictator by others.
Deftford Road crash: The bike driver died in car crash
A bike driver died in a crash involving a car in London.
A collision took place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in the eastern part of the city at Dectford, about 10:15 BST.
The driver had stopped and the paramedics had come, but the man died at the scene.
The crash took place months after another bike driver died in a runoff on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said that the officers were trying to identify the man and report to his family.
The road is closed and the bus route has been diverted and the motor drivers have been hijacked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in huru-hara
Six officers suffered injuries in a male prison riot with strict custody, the office of the lap said.
The chaos arose in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sundays and still continues.
"Tornado" Specialist officer has been forced to handle the riot, which involves eight prisoners and occurs on one side of the building.
The officers were treated at the scene of the incident because of the slight wounds on the face.
A prison speaker said: "A specially trained light dog has been forced to deal with an incident that is taking place in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend longer time behind iron bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison accommodates more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison warden was being treated at the hospital after the attack by a prisoner.
And in October last year, an anti-hurus-hara officer was called to prison to deal with a serious riot where a biliary officer was attacked.
Storms of Rosa Threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City by Flag Flood
Tropical depression that hit Arizona rarely happens, but that is likely to happen early next week because of the remaining traces of energy storm Rosa's past the western desert, leading to a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of a dwindling flood on Monday and Tuesday for the region of West Arizona to South Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa was expected to head straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, with the rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned in twitter that there are only ten tropical mice capable of causing tropical storms or state depression in 200 miles of Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm in 40 miles of border AZ."
The latest storm hub tool is capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with an isolated amount of 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other western desert areas include central Rockies and Great Basin likely have 1 to 2 inches, with the possible number of isolates reaching 4 inches.
For those in the flooded region, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because of the drought.
Although floodwaters are a serious problem, some of them are likely to benefit because the western part of the region is currently being hit by drought.
According to the U.S. United States Drought Observers, only about 40 percent of Arizona's regions are experiencing a small amount of extreme drought, the second highest category,"weather.com reported.
First, the route to the storm of Rosa leads to land across the California River at the end of Mexico.
Rosa, still in the storm force on Sunday morning at the wind speed 85 miles an hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm met the cooler waters of the Pacific and thus weakened its strength.
Therefore, it is estimated to land in Mexico with tropical storm power on Monday evenings or evenings.
High rainfall may be high in some parts of Mexico, leading to high flood risk
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is estimated to affect the California Baja region to the western area of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will cross the northern part along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will cross through Arizona and to southern Utah on Tuesday at midnight.
"The main risk that may have been caused by Rosa's storm or the rest is a very high rainfall in Baja California, Sonora's northwest region, and the U.S., the U.S. desert region." National Storm Center (NHC) said.
The rain will cause the threat of flooding and debris that flows into the desert, and the lands of the mountains will occur.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest of four attempted murder suspects
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for an attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The young man was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace Midsome Norton, about 0400 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in a stable condition.
A 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - olds and a 20 - year - old man were arrested last night in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, says the police.
Officers have been calling anyone who might have the video footage on his cell phone to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘receives hatred and anger’ from the Democratic Party
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the brutal and shameful Democratic Party assassination," Trump said on a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "receives hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the call process
Kavanaugh's testimony before Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had committed sexual violence to him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"One voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to strengthen someone who has the most perfect legal thinking in our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he told the West Virginia support crowd.
The President implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's call for action when discussing the importance of the Republic's participation in mid-election.
"Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really busy," he said.
"That's why I went there, fighting for a great future.
Trump argued that Democracy was on a mission to "fight and block."
The first vote procedure at the Senate level in Kavanaugh's call can be performed later on Friday, a senior GOP assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by an Indonesian tsunami, with an increasing number of victims
At least 384 people were killed, many were killed when giant waves hit the beach, when earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the town of Palu on Friday when a six - foot - [6 m] - tall wave destroyed the beach at night, caused a lot of death and destroyed everything he passed through.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake with the power of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increases yesterday, people still do their activities on the beach and do not run away so they become victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the speaker for the Disaster Relief Board (BNPB) said at the latest in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, timbers, houses, grips everything on the land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 mph (497 mph) before crossing the shoreline.
Some people climbed a tree to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people evacuated to 24 service centers in the Palu.
The photo released by the BNPB shows many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that were bent and ambrucated, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The storm of succession shook the city along the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes are severed in areas of 2.4 million people.
The Research and Technology Board (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted at the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb force dropped in Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geographic location of the city, at the tip of the narrow bay, can be said to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho describes the damage that happened as "extensive" and states that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
Some victims' bodies were found trapped under ruined buildings, he said, adding that there were 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be larger along the shoreline 300 km (190 miles) north of the Palu, a region called Dogalga, which was closer to the earthquake center.
Communication "was completely crippled with no information from Dogalga, says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," says the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading toward a disaster-affected region.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The institute on Saturday received much criticism because it did not inform the public that there was a tsunami that had subsided the Palu, although the authorities said that the wave had already been seized at the time of warning.
An amateur record shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a building sounding a warning with panic that there will be a tsunami approaching, towards those on the street below.
Within minutes of the water scrolls covering the beach, sinking buildings and cars.
Reuters can't immediately prove the origin of the record.
The earthquake and tsunamis were the biggest causes of the electric blackout that sent communication around the Palu so as to make it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has already started sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, says the authorities, but refugees still need food and other needs.
The airport has been reopened just to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center at the Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami Victims are increasing above 800.
That's awful.
When World Vision officials from Domaga have managed to safely to the city of Palu, where the officials sheltered in the wooden tent built in their office yards, on their journey they had passed through various porous areas, said Mr Doseba.
"They tell me that they have seen many houses destroyed," she said.
That's awful.
Even when relief groups began to move slowly to start disaster recovery activities, some of them were complaining about the intrusion of skilled foreign volunteers to go to the Palu.
According to Indonesian law, funding, aid for goods and energy from outside the country can only begin to be provided if disaster areas have been officially declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, OK, it's a national disaster," we can receive international help, but there's no such status."
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in the Palu, friends and families of the lost victims still hope that those they love will be part of the miracle that will repair the course of the natural disaster story.
On Saturday, a boy was kicked out of his cup.
On Sunday, the rescuer pulled out a woman stuck under the debris for two days with the mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesian national paragliding team coach, has been a coach for two missing paragliding athletes, who were able to follow the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those who are still trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Father Mandage, are his followers.
"As a senior in paralysing, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told me how after news of the Roa-Roa Hotel that was destroyed was scattered around the paralysing community, despairingly he sent whatsApp message to the Palu competitors, who also participated in the celebration on the beach.
Even so, all the messages, only got one sign of gray, not two blues.
"I think it means an unsent message," he said.

Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced a change in his name over Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one that was formally known as Kanye West."
West, age 41, has been named Ye for some time and uses it as its eighth album title, released in June.
The change was made before the performance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to perform at the show, which was canceled because of "emotional reason," said the show creator.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that for him the word had religious meaning.
"I believe 'ye' is the common word used in the Bible, and it means 'you',' says West earlier this year, discussing the album title with the Big Boy Radio publisher.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to become Ye-- as a mirror of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, all.
It's more like our real self-smart."
He's one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known in a variety of ways as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of connection and a big letter.
President of Mexico, AMLO, I swear not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had sworn that he would never use military power against civil society until the 50th anniversary of the bloody response against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military power to push the Mexicans."
The troops fired fire at peaceful demonstration on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when the left wing crew movement planted its roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already secured support for young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those in college and opening more universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity for education stimulates young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. is supposed to double the A.I. funding.
Since China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should increase the amount of funds that will be used for research in the field, the words investors and A2 Kai-Fu Lee practices, which have already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. was completely lacking in formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: to become number one in the 2030 innovation.
"Dreaming AI research funding is a good start, considering all other countries tend to stay away from the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
Expanding funds can double opportunities so that the next major AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, the owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of the Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed the AI system that defeated the best American Othello player, and then he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and Google’s Chinese branch president.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's technological competition as a Robotic Challenge for the Modern Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win the gift from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China taking the lead in academics; it's a company," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring experts from universities for AI research for the last few years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. to support around AI efforts.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for the holder of the PHD title in the AI field," he said.
The Chinese National Council issued the plan for the Development of Generations Next in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions as much as the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the lower quality of academic work in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed a Joint Building Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industrial partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of the Selection Committee for Building Intelligence.
And in this month DARPA announces a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, DARPA recently invested over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that called for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Creating Intelligence did not see any further steps for months.
Macedonian citizens make a vote in order to change their country's name
The Macedonians took a vote on Sunday to decide that the name of the country would be "North Macedonia Republic," an act that would resolve disputes for a decade with Greece that had challenged its membership offer to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greek, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the view that the name of its neighboring northern state represents a confession of ownership of its region and has forbidden its membership with NATO and the European Union.
Both governments reached a deal in June based on a new name, but nationalist opposition argued that change would damage most ethnic populations of Slavia Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not give his voice to the general election and a boycott campaign had created doubts whether the election results could reach the minimum of 50 percent needed to be declared legitimate.
The question is: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting any agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price worth paying to get permission into the body like the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the younger generation Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although not legally bound, quite a number of members of parliament say they will follow the results of the vote to make decisions.
Changing names requires a two-by-three vote in parliament.
The national election commission said there was no report of a breach until 1 p.m.
However, it turns out that the result of the vote is only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the voters registered gave their voice mail.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we were in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a picker in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice for general election in Macedonia in order to change the name of the country that will open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, has prepared a small stage and pulled the seats in front of the tents that those who are going to boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join in honorably, not through the waiter door," said Kavarkov.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investments needed for Macedonia, which had more than 20 percent unemployment.
"I believe most of the people will approve it because over 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving her voice mail.
He said "yes" would be "confirming our future."
A survey published by the Macedonian Research Institute on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the required number.
Other polls, held by Telma Macedonian TV station, found 57 percent of the respondents planning to join in on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
For such a successful vote to be won, it takes 50 percent plus 1 voice.
A failure in the vote will represent a rejection of the first policy against the pro-Barat government since taking over in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City is exploring the entire Brighton defense to score goals.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were assigned as Brighton's defense on Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made that victory look very easy on his score in the minutes of 65.
Argentine attackers received an operand in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three men defending Brighton, before bad luck entered the open field.
Aguero later found himself surrounded by four green-haired people.
He turned past one defender before running ahead of some more opponents at the edge of Brighton's cage.
Then he opped to his left, to Sterling.
The British front wave used his first kick from the gawg to operate the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat the Brighton kiper, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the gawang.
"Aguero fought with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola manager of the city to the reporter.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
Sure enough, the young Bethelites have befriended Jacob.
We're glad he scored a goal at that time."
But Sterling gave Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League fight.
That goal happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball, far in the Brighton region at the game.
He pulled the ball with a long, dazzling kick through the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Sane did a bit of a ball before leading Sterling to a remote post.
Sky Blue's front bumps the ball into the cage right before the ball jumps out of the border.

Scherzer wants to complain about spoiler versus Rockies
With the reliminating of the Nationals of the playoff game, there's no more reason to force another game.
But Scherzer who is too competitive hopes to be able to overcome Colorado Rockies at the game on Sunday, but only if there's still a playoff involvement for Rockies, which is superior in one match over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies had at least won a spot after winning a wild-card match against Nationals with score 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division title.
"Although we play without winning, at least we can find out the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd of audiences and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
How can I not compete in such a game?"
Nationals have not yet announced the opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer compete.
Scherzer, who will start a 34-time job, holds a training session on Thursday and starts a Sunday game that is usually used to rest.

Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The President pointed to the situation of the Supreme Court's decision, Brett Kavanaugh, when discussing the importance of the Republican people's vote in mid-election.
"All our efforts have been put at risk in November.
Five weeks before the most important election is done in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't really run that's why I fought all over the place for the incredible candidate," he said.
Trump continues, "You've seen that there's a radical group of radicals that are very, very horrible, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you see crime, their disgust.
They do not care whom they hurt.
Democracy, he says, is on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, "called the Democrats "wrath and evil and indecent and unbelievable."
He referred to the Senate of Dianne Feinstein, who served on the Senate Justice Committee by mentioning its name, which was accompanied by a thorough search by its listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting-- it's a very bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The labor force party is no longer a public service.
Now be an intolerance to anyone who has raised his mind
When the Activist Momentum in the local party I gave a voice to criticize me, it wasn't surprising.
Moreover, I was in the last order of the Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we spoke opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan got a similar treatment because he defended anti-Semitism with strictness.
In my case, the chaos criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the ironic issue that Jeremy Corbyn opposed to earlier leaders.
The announcement for the meeting of the North Nottingham workers on Friday states that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the General Committee meeting that took place on Friday night exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about "better, more friendly" politics is not long forgotten, if, of course, it has ever begun.
The differences in opinion in the labor party are becoming more and more evident and each opinion is judged to be worthy of the authority of the party.
It began as soon as Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague I thought I would be able to share the same political views, beginning to expect me to turn around and accept a position that I would never accept - both in national security and in the single European Union market.
Whenever I speak openly--and no matter what I say--then after that there will be a search in the social media that calls for the abolition of the show, the central politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And it wasn't just me who had it.
Of course, I know that I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day but never go away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of today’s political era is the level of abuse that has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should help develop tolerance culture.
The truth is we are no longer in the larger church and with every motion "unbelievable" or transforming the selection of party rules into more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that encouraged me to keep a head down, not talk too much of an opinion, and then I'll say, "All right."
But I fell into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by thatcher’s government lease that caused my comprehensive school class literally collapsed, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who greatly need him - both as local counsellors and ministers in government.
I never hid my political action, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East will question my policy position and things that I do not agree with today's leadership.
For those who encourage the occasion on Friday, which I can say is when the country moves fast towards the division of sovereignty, it will endanger our state business and public service, I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, as a member of the Labour Party or not. I'm proud to serve you and I promise that there is no threat of dismissal or political policy that will prevent me from doing what I believe is the best interest for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The invincible Ayr ascends to the top position
The last two trials may have been slightly misleading the outcome, but no doubt Ayr deserves winning the Tennent's Premiership game today.
Now they're in the top order, the only unbeatable side of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and their ability to achieve the best opportunity, which makes the host team and coach Peter Murchie have the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still not defeated so we feel happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The appreciation for Ayr, they better take a chance than we did."
The experiment Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in front, but the yellow card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given at the game by Warriors, gave the opportunity for Melrose to print numbers and Jason Baggot stole an unconverted experiment.
Climate diverted Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of time, he scored a goal and then did a single attempt to make Ayr score 17-5 at rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which was changed by Baggot, reduced the chances up to five points.
And then there was a long break because Ruaridh Knott had a serious wound, was driven out, and since the start of the game, Ayr went on faster than trying to try Stafford McDowall, changed by Clima.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a spare player pay with an unaltered Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of the pressure.
Mr. Homer has come back to play, but by the time Struan Hutchinson gets a yellow card because he's throwing Clima without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrives behind Ayr's advanced wounded.
Climate has been replaced, as has been the case, almost since the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe made a gauntlet kick and disrupted the fifth effort of Gregor Henry's writer.
Still Game star looks ready for his new career in the restaurant industry
Star Still Game Kieran was ready to move course to the service industry after it was previously known that he was renovated as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis at the BBC popular event, which is sponsored and also starred with an old comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The couple had announced that the ninth series to come was the last episode, and Kiernan appeared to be planning to drive the air directly after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun narrative implied that Kiernan was trying to get involved in "the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘ The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by the land, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific.
Sailors are patrolling at the large base of the La Paz state army.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Navy Camp from Titicaca to Amazon was swept by motorcycles: "The sea is our legitimate right.
To get back up is a duty."
Passing through Bolivia, surrounded by land, memories of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a 19th - century bloody conflict are still clear - as the desire to once again sail across the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, for Bolivia is waiting for court orders on October 1 after the five - year conference.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who are going to watch the ICJ trial across the country, hope that the court in Den Haag will support Bolivia’s claim that - after several decades of invigorating talks - Chile is required to negotiate the guarantee of Bolivia’s sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the Bolivian president of the Bolivian nation who is embroiled in the controversial war for next year's election - also has a lot of support for the Monday trial.
"We've been very close to the return of the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court cannot decide what Bolivia wants - and that would only change a little if it was possible.
The Dutch-based United Nations body does not have the power to hand over Chile, and has already determined that it will not decide the outcome of the negotiations.
That ICJ's statement came only six months after the final argument was heard, which indicates the case "uncomplex," says Paz Zárate, an international expert in Chile.
And still far from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years it may well have gone down.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he says.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the good icticikad of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at a certain point will remain in dialogue, but it will be very difficult to keep the discussion going on after this.
Since 1962, the two nations had not exchanged large Ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian government representative in Den Haag rejected the decision-making idea quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with profit together," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-still one of the most famous Latin American president-uses maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never lose her right to have access to the Pacific," she added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see what we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons outlets won't happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Minister Ri Yong Ho said the first country would never remove nuclear weapons if Korea couldn't trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the General Court of the United Nations.
He mentioned the United States to carry out a deal that was made at a meeting in Singapore between competing leaders.
His comment appeared when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to have almost begun a nuclear diplomacy that had been destroyed for more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri said only a "one dream" that by continuing the U.S. sanctions and denial of the declaration of the Korean War would make North Korea give up.
Washington was on the lookout to approve the declaration without Pyongyang making efforts to decommission the armed forces earlier.
Both Kim and President of the U.S. Donald Trump want to have a second meeting.
But there's a doubt that Pyongyang is seriously about the confession of the weaponry that the country has become the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris fashion show shows a lot of the latest head cover collection to the main road near you
If you want to multiply a collection of hats or really want to protect from sunlight don't look for others.
The designer Valentino and Thom Browne put out a series of big-sized caps for their SS19 collection at a fashion show stage with a fascinating style held in Paris Fashion Week.
The truly impractical hat has swept away Instagram this summer and these designers have been showing creations that are eye-catching on the stage of the sports.
The highlight of Valentino is a krem - colored hat that is decorated with the width of the fur tray covering the head of the model.
Large - size accessories include a diamond - adorned pair, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange mask-and right through Halloween.
A lot of color masks whose lips have been sewn up and look like Hannibal Lecter compared to high couture.
A creation that looks like a snorkeled subsquabs equipped with snorkels and glasses, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep going through the collections of the width mode - then you're being flattered.
Fashion watchers estimate that the big hat collection will be placed on the main road near you.
The big-sized hats became a very fast train in the ‘La Bomba’, a straw hat with a width of two feet is seen to be used by everyone including Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The worship of the label behind a very impractical hat of social media makes a great creation on the beach of the large straws almost the same as swimwear - used as a model.
The radiator bag that was burned, cut with the radiator on the edge with white straps, is an outstanding feature of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrator Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see the big hat and beach bag arrive on the main road for the next summer--because the designer has already made a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for the big accessory"
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens
The private school in Scotland keeps track of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with an extraordinary test result, which is being strengthened by every student and collective success in sports, arts, music and hard work.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish High School Council (SCIS) are working hard to provide the best services for students and parents.
The school is designed to prepare its students for higher and higher education, career choices, and their role as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education that can design and implement the school curriculum according to expected, we see the modern language continue to be a popular subject of choice and desired in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in the language he understands, you'll get into his head.
If you speak to her in her language then you will enter her heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test results this year, we can see that language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation value in the independent school.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn foreign language get A Plus.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of the students obtained A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish also had A.
This indicates that the school itself in Scotland supports foreign language as an important skill that will surely be needed by children and adolescents in the future.
Currently languages, as a choice of students, are held in the same standards as the STEM students (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematics) in the modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Service and Skills in 2014 found that from some reasons why employers had to continue to struggle to fill the openings, 17 percent why it was less of a language skill.
As a result, more and more language skills are encouraged to prepare teenagers for their coming careers.
As ever - increasing opportunities for work in the field of speaking become available, this skill is essential in the world around us.
Whatever a person's career choices, if they've learned the second language, in the future they'll feel real benefits because of having this kind of lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country would automatically make a superior multilingual in competition.
According to the opinion of YouGov in over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak foreign languages well enough to make French and conversation the only language spoken in two percent digits, 15 percent.
This is why investing in learning the language for children now is important for the moment.
Having a multilingual ability, especially the language of the developing countries with a growing economy, will divide children with a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important in Britain for a few years to come, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected in private schools, with the teaching staff that are experts in this field.
The school is designed to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and transfer them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever future happens.
It cannot be ruled out that today, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
The independent school will continue to offer this choice, elegance, and excellence to Scotland’s teenagers.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish School of Mandiri
LeBron will be debuting for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting for fans to see LeBron James start his debut for Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Laker Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening of Sunday's season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it hasn't been determined how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote tweets that James might play just a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plan for the six games for Lakers.
"On the stage of my career right now, I don't have to do a season game to prepare," he said.
General Trump Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a public campaign meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first Trump public meeting of five public meetings scheduled for next week, including a stop in some fun places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was stated that the vote was postponed so that he could choose to fill in the Supreme Court, Trump meant to build support for him for the upcoming general election half-time because the Republican Party risked losing control of Congress if the vote was held on November.
What time is Trump's general meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's general meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 a.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's public meeting in West Virginia online via direct broadcast on YouTube.
It is possible that Trump will discuss this week's trial for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who is becoming more tense after the charges of improper sexual acts and the estimated Senate voter will be postponed until a week while the FBI investigates them.
But the main purpose of this public meeting agenda is to help the Republic party get some moments in the face of the November public election.
Therefore, in the campaign President Trump mentioned that five public meetings this week aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and DPR," Reuters said.
"Conference control is very important for his agenda so the president will travel as many countries as possible during our busy campaign season," the Trump campaign speaker who refused to mention his name giving to Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's public meeting is expected to provide support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attracts coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be a second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump was trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the candidate of the West Virginia Senate of the Republic Party who was left behind in the polls.
"Not a good sign for Morrisey so the president should come as an attempt to raise his earnings in the poll," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows courage to hold their hopes in the face of the single game Sunday
After three sessions one-sided, the foursome Saturday afternoon session is probably required in this Ryder Cup.
The swinging of the bandul momentum is a sport concept that is the result of a fully trusted discovery by the players, and nothing greater than in this competition.
What do they think is the moment?
"Before they were six points taller and now four, so I think we considered it a little bit of a moment," Jordan Spieth said as he passed that day.
Of course Europe has a profit because it's up to four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had a little bit of a moment and they had a lot of things that could become a spirit, no exception to the Spieth and Justin Thomas formations that played together all day and each of them boasts of three out of four points.
Spieth has played deadlyly from the tea area to the green area and led with skill.
The screams of the celebratory are getting louder when the turn comes, making a major putting blow to make a serious match when he and Thomas lose two against two.
The whores of him who won them at the 15th that was greeted with similar screams, the scream that told you that he was sure America didn't lose.
"You really should try harder and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes that need to be marked.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days ago was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed story from Ryder Cup.
A unique but attractive couple from Europe are four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey punch on Saturday afternoon, but they were also prevented from bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seems to flow either to or from this rich crowd that convinces them that they are players to be defeated on Sunday, and there are no players more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari who will lock up Europe's potential victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
It's better if at the same time they're both placed in a different hole.
Still, it was too early to discuss Europe’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson slowed down the work of Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero in the morning, when he was paired up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the nine front like digging holes that can never be scaled by the Spanish and Swedish golfers.
Even though, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are a good show to be seen closer because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategy can change at once.
So far, Europe plays better as a team and leads far enough to the end day, but the foursome session also shows that the U.S. team has the nerve to compete even though doubted by some parties, especially in the United States.
Top 10-6 Europe on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the final day of Ryder Cup after the rise of four-ball and four-some Saturdays by leading 10-6 over the United States.
The Duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead with two victories over Tiger Woods who have to fight to record their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
The Thomas Bjorn European team, who wanted to maintain the trophy that was unattainable in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. team that was mistargeted in the morning fourball, made this series result 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes, won two games, but they could not reduce deficits.
The Jim Furyk team needs eight points from 12 single games on Sunday to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debut to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after the end of the sensational week, are only a second couple winning four points from the four opening points in their Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs they became very solid to defeat weak Woods and American debut Bryson Dechambeau with stronger 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturdays, occasionally performing brilliantly but he's already lost 19 out of 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rest in the morning fourball, then back to pair with Henrik Stenson in the forsome and lose 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka -- world rank one and three.
Europe didn't reach itself even though the day was fun and winding in the west of Paris.
The lead winner three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the US standard with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 win that attracted Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball then back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in foursome after losing the first two holes.
Just twice in Ryder Cup history where a team returns from the deficit four points into the single game, even though as the champion survives the Furyk team only needs a serial point to maintain the trophy.
But after becoming the second best for two days, the Sunday’s next attack seemed to go beyond them.
North Korea says 'unpossible' will disarm separately without any trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations of the ongoing sanctions against the United States, and it was unlikely that the country would disarm its nuclear weapons separately in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the World's General Council that North Korea had taken "significant steps to show good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, demolishing the nuclear testing site, and promised not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But, we didn't see a proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we cannot disarm our own weapons first separately."
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's "dreaming" approach to re-enrollment where North Korea would be punished for taking steps gradually, his statement stated that they did not completely reject as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit meeting between the president of the United States and the new North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, at that time Kim promised to "encouraging Korean border integration" while Trump promised security assurances North Korea.
North Korea has officially wanted the end of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States says that Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected the call for international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "preliminating" and increases pressure with the semi-sanctioned gift to achieve their purpose, and even rejects "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us bend our knees is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that these sanctions will continue to deepen our distrust."
Ri didn't mention a plan for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, the United States leader of the United Nations early this week.
In fact, the Minister called for three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added, "If the problem-makers in this investigation are South Korea and not the United States, the South Korean border investigations won't reach this kind of dead end."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the General Court of the United Nations that targeting North Korea's rockets on the United States was something that could not be avoided after "Mr. President Demon" Trump called Kim "man rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at a United Nations meeting, a Trump who threatened to "destruct" North Korea in total, commend Kim for her courage to take steps to disarm, but that big job still has to be done and sanctions must remain done until North Korea has been doing annullification.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months--it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia feel that the UN Security Council must punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanction of the Security Council must be continued firmly and must not fail until we find out that full, final and verifiable reproduculation is done."
Security Council with round voices has increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop the provision of the Pyongyang nuclear program and ballistic missile.
Pompeo met Ri at all times in the General Council of the United Nations and then said that he was going to visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there's actually been progress, just North Korea in the count of the storming hours that he's making "a lawsuit like a gangster."
North Korea promises in a meeting with Moon this month to unload missile locations and also nuclear complexes if the United States takes "a proper move."
He said that Kim told him to do the "appropriate course" with his wish is the security assurance that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough breaks
A new course at Harvard University this year made all S1 students there sleep more, in an effort to fight macho culture in learning that is growing through 'manufacturer man' of caffeine.
An academic found that students at the university number one world often don't know anything if talking about a very basic matter about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a medical professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course, which he believed was the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a course on the effects of sleepless studies.
'In the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why did I just be told now, in my late year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping--that surprised me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The first course of this year, to explain to the students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic results, and to improve their public welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding students who were very short of sleep throughout the week.
The one - hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there was a picture of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the influence of caffeine and light, and how athletic results were influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleeptime routines.
On the other hand, the participant gets an explanation of how long the lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A college map, with interactive icons, then pushers to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change student behavior instantly.
But we're sure that they have the right to know-- like you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health,' fuck Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride with the 'single' still exists, according to custom, plus that modern technology and increasing pressure on students that means lack of sleep is a problem that continues to grow.
Make sure you sleep enough, with good quality, must be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, stress - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain activate the mode of hunger, creating a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology that helped Professor Czeisler design the course, took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize the course for the entire college.
The next step, he hoped that the entire graduate student would be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining competitive institutions.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider regulating the alarm during sleep, also the alarm wakes up, and realize the effects of the ‘blue light’ emitted by the electronic screen and LED lights, which can divert your circulatory rhythm out of its gear to cause sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga mentale down Gerrard's army
In addition, Rangers felt the sadness of the day in the field when Dolly Menga attacked to deliver the Steven Gerrard team that was overrun by 1-0 hits in Livingston.
The Ibox team tried to record their first victory on their way, since the 4-1 victory in February at St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team just gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as a manager, causing his team to miss eight points from the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts class.
Attacking seven minutes before the first round is over and the players who are out of reason do not seem to balance.
While Rangers are now down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third position, just left a gap of goals from Hibernian.
And there could be a further problem in Rangers after the Calum Spence liner had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown away.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that slipped Ayr into the semi-final Betfred Cup.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that took one point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with the costume that haunted their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the possession of the ball, but Livingston uses the ball they own better.
They should have recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bait Meng was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's glove, but it attracted that big opportunity too wide.
The Jacobs free shot that was deep then met Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Litthgow could only stab wide in the back position.
Rangers took control but there seems to be more hope than belief in their game at the third end.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have been penalized when he and Steven Lawless had broken into a quarter of an hour's mark but listened to Steven Thomson's rejection of this Colombian citizen.
Rangers only managed to do two pitches in the first round, but the previous Ibox's guard, Liam Kelly, had hardly ever had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head restraint and the easy-to-fly Ovie Ejaria attack.
Although Livi's opening goals in the 34th minute may be opposed to the game path, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs's deep death ball tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball on Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Megga for the simple end.
Gerrard acted at rest by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and that shift almost gave direct effect when the wing player put the ball on Morelos but Kelly played impressively quickly out of the line to kick.
But Livingston continues to force a ranger team to play the exact game they enjoy, with Litthgow and Halkett wiped out all the long balls.
Holt's team was supposed to expand their excellence at the end but McGregor stood up well to chase Jacobs before Litthgow across the width of the corner.
Rangers' replacement player, Glenn Middleton, claimed penalty again when he was arguing with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face away.
Almanac: Geiger Breaker
And now from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and the mass will continue to rise... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was a discovery that eventually made the device called Geiger Breakdown.
Being a science-based tool since then, the Geiger divider also became a pop culture base, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starred cowboy scientists who seem less convincing of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Breaker, used to find a radioactive mineral location, like uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of the atom released by radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, it's got to come up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But that discovery kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune systems to ‘know’ evil cells
New cancer vaccines teach immune systems to 'know' the evil cells and kill them
Vaccins teach immune systems to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
His method involves extracting the immune cells from the patient, converting them to the lab.
They can then 'recognize' the common protein in many cancers and then inject it again.
An experiment vaccine shows promising results on patients with various types of cancer.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize evil cells, and ovarian cancer was lost for over 18 months.
This method involves the extraction of patients' immune cells, transforming them into laboratories so that they can "recognize" the proteins that are commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then inject them back into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the United States National Cancer Agency in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The success of this shows that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "supports the growth of some type of cancer," including breast cancer, ovary, lung, and cholerectal, Prof. Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking patients' immune cells and "teaching" to them how to target cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West starts Diatribe Pro-Trump, wears the MAGA hat, after the SNL's appearance.
Not Running Well
Kanye West was mugged at the studio during Saturday Night Live after performing a mess where he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said he was going to run in 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, called Ghost Town where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic party and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL started a show with a charade that Matt Damon starred at where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee on the claim of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcasted, the West tapes were uploaded to social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with that fraud.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind stage because of the hat he wore.
"They snuggled me behind stage.
They said, 'Don't come out with that hat.'
They're subverting me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "Do you want to see a dive?" saying that he's going to wear Superman's coat, because this means you can't dictate what I should do.
Try to love."
The comment produced at least twice the audience and the SNL audience seemed ashamed, Variety reported, with one person saying, "The whole studio is quiet."
West was brought in at last moments as a replacement for Ariana Grande, former rapist boyfriend Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confuses a lot of people with I Love it's song, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner who wrote tweet: "For one of the bravest souls: LOVE HAS BEEN ENOUGH."
But Karen Hunter's host writes tweet that West is just "being himself and it's really very good."
"But I chose not to give someone (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe in bringing in and excruciating ideologies that are dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So do we," plus.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "a creature who is officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's trail, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Together with rap singers, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and of course the legend of Prince music, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist known as Prince.

The Star Game of Thrones Harington Kit criticizes poisonous masculine
Harington's kit is famous for swinging swords into its role as Jon Snow in the mid-century fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
However, this actor, 31, with the exception of male hero stereotypes, said that the role on the screen is often made young boys feel that they must be strong to respect.
Talk to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says that he's sure there's something wrong and questioning how to handle a bad masculine problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who just married his opponent at Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, claimed he felt 'strong enough' to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, quite powerful, right now-- where is our fault in this masculine matter?' he said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, related to the problems we see now?'
The kit believes television may be responsible for the appearance of bad masculineness with its very masculine character.
He goes on to say: 'Which is the character since birth and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV, and on the street, which makes boys feel that they have to have this particular side to be men?
I think it's really one of the big questions of this time-- how do we change it?
Because there's clearly something wrong with the boys.'
In that interview he also admitted that he would not play in premuel or sequel Game of Thrones when this series will end next summer, saying that he's been 'completed with the field of war and horses'.
Since November Kit will be returning True West from Sam Shepard, the story of his film producer and brother, who was a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so she gave me the future family, and from here my life began' her speech.
Rose plays Ygritte, the love of kit character, Jon Snow, in this Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
This couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Tiokok reports 14% of new cases
China has announced 14% of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are infected in this country, says a health officer.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases were transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, the health officer in China said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people was called more and more.
Because of the conservative value of this country, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many illnesses stem from sexual protection that is inadequate in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters argued that the staff had leaked GOP senator data, spread 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
The representative of Maxine Waters on Saturday argued that one of his staff members had sent personal information to three senators of the United States Republic Party to the Wikipedia page Members of Parliament.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserts that the claim is driven by experts and websites "ultra-right wing".
"Talk, lie, and so on," says Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the information provided includes the home address and phone number of the United States Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appears online on Thursday, sent by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during the Senate panel of the charges of improper sexual abuse against the plaintiffs of the Great Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
This bocoran appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that IP addresses identifying the source of the shipment are connected to the Waters office and revealing information from one of the Waters staff members, Hill reported.
"This claim is not based really wrong and it's an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member--identity, personal information, and his safety are threatened by accusations of deception and error--not at all responsible for this leak.
This is not a false accusation.
Waters quickly attracts online criticism, including former Secretary of Press White House Ari Fleischer.
"This thing means anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be a Congressman.
They realize that the harboring of guilt is counterproductive.
They must not deviate.
They shouldn't question the motive of the impertinent.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of critics being too angry during the congregation on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the candidate of the Republican party who is trying to move Waters into the half-time election, also conveys his thoughts on Twitter.
"Certainly if it's true," it's written on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "right authority and the law enforcement entity about this wrong accusation.
"We'll make sure that the perpetrators will be revealed," he continues, "and they will be legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions for one and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - a poor Rowan Atkinson spy parody
Now looking for the significance of Brexit in every new film with an old English view has become a tradition and it seems to be happening for the resurgence of the paralabas damádios Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcasm syndicate be about how clearly we're going to be a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English, whose eyes are wobbly, rubber-faced, and incompetent, has updated his license to mess up everything for the second time - his name suggests more than anything that he is a large comical creation designed for a foreign - speaking cinema area.
Surely he is a crazy secret agent who, despite his strange suspicions, has a little clouseau character, a select of Mr. Bean's character and a second-century hiker who gives a little note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Indeed, he is based on an international mysterious visitor and man who Atkinson was ever played on the Barclaycard TV advertising that is now forgotten, leaving the mess behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on this latest JE trip.
I like it when Johnny English approached the helicopter with a mid-century zyri dress and slender rotor straps quickly attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy was shown, but his humor felt less powerful and too strange, especially when branding "serious" films like 007 and Mission couldn't have trusted to insert comets as a substance.
It feels like it's meant for kids from adults, and for me it's some weird Johnny English mischievous non-innovative and a focus on Atkinson's movie jokes in Bean's personality.
The hot prize these years are that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field, to disappoint an agent on duty - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the proud and hostile prime minister, who has destroyed his total population politically: Emma Thompson played a very good role in the almost Teresa-May character but not much can be done from his text.
His intelligent advisors provide information that since every active spy has been weakened, he must bring someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English's own clique, now hired as head of school in some fancy buildings, but giving a secret lesson on how to perform disguise surgery: there's some good jokes here, when English offers spy academy like School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency briefings and reunited again with an old friend who had suffered a long time, Bough, being taunted by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, instructing a submarine commander, the role of the high-class bitch who sucks where Vicki Pepperdine is getting a little out of the way.
So Batman and Robin made a mistake on Your Majesty's Secret Agent back in action, meeting a beautiful mysterious Ophelia Bulletova that Olga Kurylenko held.
Meanwhile, the prime minister worriedly fell into the influence of the millionaire of karism technology that claimed could solve the British computer problem: evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their ridiculous adventure: disguise as a waiter, they burned the French fast-paced restaurant; they made a mess by sneaking onto the luxury ship of Volta; and English triggered anarchy when he tried to use virtual reality headset to get used to inside Volta's house.
All the arrests must have been pulled for the last sequence, but with such hospitality and strife, there's a little TV channel of kids that's all about it.
It's quite moderate.
And like the other Johnny English film, I can't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
The workers objected to planning plans for British citizens to be able to work four days a week but to be paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Workers ’ Union considered radical plans that wanted British citizens to work four days a week - but paid five days.
The union was reported to want the owners of the company to continue the discovery through a revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) for the workers by giving them additional holidays.
He'll let the employees enjoy the weekend - but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea will be "not" with the economic agenda of the party and the plan encourages the country to support the workers.
The four-day transition of the week has been approved by British Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A source, the senior of the Labour Union, told The Sunday Times: 'The payment of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This will not happen overnight, but four days a week's work is an aspiration according to the party approach to re-assessing the economy that supports workers and the party's industry strategy as a whole.'
Labour is not the first to support that idea, because Green Party has promised four days of work in a week on the 2017 public election campaign.
However, these aspirations are not supported by the entire Labour Party at this time.
The Labour Party's spokesman says: 'On a working day in a week, it's not party policy and it's not being considered by the party.'
Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to perfect his vision for a social revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the anonymous director and the claws at the utility company.
This shadow Chancellor's plan also means that the current stockholder in the drinking water company may not be able to get his entire stock back because the government of the Labour Party can do "debate" for the reason of the violation.
He also made sure that his plan was to put workers in the board of companies and to create Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the corporate equity in the private sector to employees, who would rely on annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his prosecution at the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question whether the finding of this office could affect the senators of the Republic Party to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Senate of the Republic Party, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find something that could change their minds.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his South Carolina partner.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charge came up, and said, 'You did it?'
He's firm, determined, firm."
However, it seems that Graham’s voice will not be changed.
"My mind has made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I do know is: Brett fought him hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned can't verify his name.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What does the Global Citizen Festival mean, and has this event done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will hold a Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that showcases the star's most impressive performances, and a mission that is also effective; ending the world's poverty.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of this event is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (unless you want to pay VIP tickets), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen for 12 years been in achieving his goal?
Does the idea of giving a free concert are the right way to invite people to do an action, or just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded by its supporters, motivated to set another goal.
It is said that this action has helped to provoke world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that would affect more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has gathered 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of them have been funded or funded.
This group estimates that security funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some major commitments, among others, The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in Britain made up of investors and agents committed to "helping children grow to their maximum potential," promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end food shortages in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice about the lack of nutrition as a foothold in history," Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
This group also said that after over 5,000 actions to increase nutrition for mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions on Ask General Answers on their websites that asked "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizen answers: "This will be a long and difficult road--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just like the civil rights movement and the great anti-apartheids that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we are united we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the stars that perform this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "block" to curb Russian energy exports - Secretary of State
"If necessary" Washington could call for aid from the Navy to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly believes that Russian involvement in Syria - especially, where it operates on a legitimate government invitation - is a substitute for exploring a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be energymakers, just like they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that capacity, with our Navy, to ensure the open seaway, and, if necessary, to do the blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nirlaba group that called himself an "energy customer's voice" in the United States.
He compared the approach Washington made in a deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
"Economic choices in Iran and Russia are less than, using and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
This statement emerged when Trump's government representative was on a mission in order to increase their natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper choice for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump government officials, including the US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 "undeservable" oil pipeline project, which Trump said, made Berlin a "combat" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream oil plant project 2 $11 billion, designed to double the capacity of the oil mill pipe that is up to 110 billion cubic feet [110 billion cubic meters], is the pure economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's hard fight against this project is merely motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy cannot be used to exert pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexsandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. attitude has attracted a reaction from Germany, which has reconfirmed their commitment to this project.
The leading industry organization of Germany, the Federation of German Industries, has asked the US not to interfere in the energy policy of the European Union and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a big problem if the third country mixes our energy supply," says Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren was going to "see the situation" when she ran for President in 2020, said Senator Massachusetts.
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he would "see the situation" when running as president after a half-time election.
While campaigning in the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider running.
"It's time for the woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, including putting the woman in the top position," as she said to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'll look at the situation when I run for president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when he was campaigning in the city hall, saying that he "takes this area in the wrong direction.
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren blah-blanks in delivering his criticism of Trump and future Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we do a vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own constituents did not want him to run by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "possibly" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run himself, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent that supports the caller.
The media showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running and 48 percent against him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed regarding the possibility of running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quoted PTSD Track Palin on the Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my son will experience, what he will experience when he returns, I can connect with other families who also experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers have experienced," he said in front of those who attended the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and told him about his son and other veterans, "they returned a little differently, they came back harder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, the other soldiers and the pilots and every other member of the military to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, plus with reports of domestic violence and drunk possession of weapons, according to Dan Bennett, the spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of a new policy of asylum
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support the legal challenge against new U.S. policies that refuse asylum for victims who escape gangs or violence in their homes.
The representative of 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court briefing on Friday in Washington to support the policy-makers of asylum-seekers, NBC News reported.
The full name of the defendant Grace v. In the session suit submitted by American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not yet been revealed.
He said his partner "and his son was a cruel gang member," had harassed him, but the U.S. officials refused his request on July 20.
He's under arrest in Texas.
The state prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produced a large quantity of shellfish for the U.S., as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US policy of asylum is behind the 2014 decision of the Immigration Council to allow black immigrants to escape from domestic violence to propose asylum.
Attorney General District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "is ignoring the law of the state, federal, and international that has existed for decades."
"Federal law requires that all claims should be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances related to the claim, and such prohibition as that violates the principle," said the friend-of-the short brief.
Further prosecutors gave a brief view that the policy that refused entry to immigrants was detrimental to the US economy, saying that they would probably become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered the immigration judge to no longer give his condolences to the victims who escaped from domestic violence and gang violence.
"It is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, national, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion," Sessions said in the announcement of this policy on June 11.
It's not meant to ease all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
The rescue effort was very sad in the Palu because the victims doubled in racing with time to find the survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very exciting," says a 35-year-old mother named Risa Kusuma, who calms her baby boy who's taking a break at the refugee center in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare."
People are looking back at their destroyed homes, taking water-stained goods, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and cared for in the hospital, the damage caused by the 7.5 - powerful earthquake, was a mess.
Some of them were injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from fractures of the spine and shoulders, lying outside the White Army Hospital, where the patient was cared for outside the room because of a strong tremor.
His tears flowed as he returned his feelings when the earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
"I couldn't save myself.
I think I'm stuck in the ruins of the wall," Haris said to the Associated Press, he added that his family were in the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, then be quiet.
I don’t know what she is like and my daughter.
May they survive."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses Turkey of 'strengthening' with 'propaganda'
A week after the official newspaper of China contains a four-page advertisement on a U.S. newspaper that mentions the profit of the U.S.-T. trading counter, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday who referred to China Daily's pay supplement in Des Moines Register - the state's most popular newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, an accusation disputed by Tiokok.
Trump's claim that Beijing is trying to get involved in elections in the United States, which marks what U.S. official told Reuters, is a new phase in the expansion of Washington's campaign to push China.
Although it's a common thing for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington are trapped in the ever-increasing trade war, which makes them raise the rate of duty to each other.
The Chinese payoff at the beginning of this trade war was designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who supported the Trump Republic Party, the Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former former governor leading Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, says Beijing has damaged workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
Tiokkok, Branstad wrote an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubles the intimidation by running propaganda ads on our own free media."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government uses the traditions of freedom of speech and press that are highly valued in the Americas by charging commercials in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Reversely, in the street newspaper newsstands here, in Beijing, you will find a restriction on different voices and will not see a real mirror of the different opinions that the Chinese might have on the troubled Chinese economic route, considering the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "it's one of the most prominent media in China that rejects the offer to publish" his article, although he doesn't mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warn, Republican Party Avoids Women's Choices Towards Half-Time Elections With Kavanaugh Disasters
Given the fact that the important people in the rising Republican Party and defending the candidates of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of some allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see the attack back, especially from women, on the general election half-time to come.
Emotions to this problem are very high, and most members of the registered Republican Party have already shown that they want to move forward in the vote.
It can't be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he questioned Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake's urges in the final minutes to do FBI investigation would be enough to relieve the voter's anger.
"Wanita won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "November is near!" when they held a demonstration in the Senate hall when the Republican Party controlled the Justice Committee to continue progressing in Kavanaugh's prosecutions, which were outside the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will come out of the list," political analysts not party Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women's voice pickers in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't give a voice."
Even before the public testimony of Ford that described in detail sexual harassment against him by the procurator of the Supreme Court, analysts would advise that there would be a future attack that would follow if the Republican Party continued to encourage him to move forward with confirmation.
"It became a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of the Republic Party, early last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about committee election or final vote election or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the reserve bench, it's also about how the Republic Party handles this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, U.S. Director of Priorities, a group that helps choose the Democratic Party, points to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be going to split up about who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more biased option to the last one.
A new opinion poll that YouGov did shows that 41 percent of the respondents actually believed or might believe in Ford testimony, while 35 percent said they actually believed or might believe in Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or would lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said something similar about Ford.
After the encouragement from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford's testimony under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh who was drunk had attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court's future leader showed his mercy to him when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web interviewer is planning to start a new Internet to face Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, World Wide Web inventor, launched a startup that was trying to support Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the legend of this technology, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, joking Berners-Lee says that the meaning behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to make "personal online data storage" or their own POD.
This storage may include a list of contacts, a list of tasks, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser and everything at the same time.
The unique thing about storing this personal online data is that it's really up to the user who can access what kind of information.
In a company known as "personal ownership through data."
The idea of establishing Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
This company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some staff developers who are contracted to work on the project, and the volunteer community of code makers.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralization applications using tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not they'd introduce a total change where all their business models would really be reversed last night.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post in the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a voice that has been influential in the neutrality of network debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Announcing WW1 Victoria Cross
The only ancient Church in England won Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior, remembered in her birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honour.
A warning stone was issued by his two grandsons on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was the "intelligence symbol" stone that would reveal exactly 100 years of grandpa's achievement won the award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led the battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "to cross the very thick fog beneath fire from field weapons and machines."
Then he hurried forward to the combat line and with the "greater courage" leading the front line before rushing through the field weapons alone and crippling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I knew I wouldn't be able to live but it was a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put down a flower ban after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very flattered to play a part in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many people will give."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they even got Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to watch the 206 Bellators who are so crowded just to refuse to watch the main event.
San Jose's bill contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being displayed directly all night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the English audience was struck when the fight turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciative after they are engaged until the special day for the fight.
A fan on Twitter describes the shift to children's cartoon as "disgusting jokes."
"This is the rule of government, that at 6 o'clock the content is not suitable for being shown, so replaced by a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and Bellator communication, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa and pigs," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker's company said they'd fix their schedules by counting the audience in England in the coming days.
"According to me, if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," said Coker.
"But right now there at six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, on Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when I change, there's a lot of text going back and forth and everything doesn't educate.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government matter.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We will reduce to five fights only from six fights - as we used to do - and we will try to avoid too much for fans, and we will succeed.
This is an unfavorable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'lower self' linked to sexuality issues
The Olympic divers Tom Daley said he grew up with low self-esteem because of his sexuality -- but that gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize it until he entered middle school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent doesn't care so much about winning the Olympics.
The bringer of the usual show that's been running this long, Kirsty Young, taking a few months' leave of illness.
Seen as the people who were cut off in the first Laverne program, Daley said he felt "less than all the others who grew up with him because "not the thing that can be socially accepted to like men and women."
He said, "Until this day, it has become clear to me that I have the power and the power to succeed."
She wanted to prove that she was "something," she said, so she wouldn't let everyone down when they found out about her sexuality.
These two Olympic bronze medalists have been the leading LGBT campaigner and using his performance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
This three-time world champion said he was in love with a man-making film from the US Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013- "surprised me."
Daley was married to an Oscarian who was 20 years older than she was last year, and she said agelessness wasn't a problem.
"When you experience so many problems at a very young age" - he followed his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone with the same age who had the same tide.
This couple had become a parent in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, all around 'I have to win the gold medal," she said.
"You know, there's something bigger than winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one last thing he asked was whether they'd already get tickets for the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to sit on the front line.
"I can't tell him 'You won't sit on Dad's front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he wasn't beat," he said.
The next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I know only, this is what I dreamt of all my life--to dive in front of the crowd of people in the Olympics, no feeling better than that," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which had joined him in his preparations for the Olympics and still made him laugh.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Miccelson changed his role when it was suggested to Ryder Cup on Saturday
Pegolf America Phil Miccelson will record the record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to change the role of avoiding an unpleasant achievement.
Miccelson, who played on the two-year show to record the record the 12th time, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball game and the fourth group on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he usually does for the United States, the winner five times this divides the time between being a cheerleader and playing his game on the scale, hoping he can fix what's in trouble.
Never been the most straightest golfer, even though at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man doesn't fit to follow a very strict course in Le Golf National, which routinely gives long and harsh punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own pitch, it's not scary enough for Micchelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, to face the most accurate open British champion Francesco Molinari, who has been working with the new comedian Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American golfer starts 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then the Miccelson match will prove very important.
Furyk expressed faith in this man, not because he could say a lot more.
"He really understands his role today, claps my back and embraces me, and says he'll be ready for the game tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He's Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine the others, but that's how they play and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Miccelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup that would never match his individual record height.
Miccelson plotted 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven serials, although Furyk said his presence brought some things that cannot be said on the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's smart, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he said.
"I think younger players have fun with him, too, this week, which is quite fun to see.
He gave me a lot more than just playing."
Captain Europe Thomas Bjorn knows the great superiority could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from the experience that someone who leads large enough to his last single game at Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane debuted first at the 1997 competition in Valderrama, with the captain of the Seve Ballesteros team holding the top five points above America, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the thinst margin, won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we're getting the big grandest in Valderrama; we're getting the greatst in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just recently," says Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 good on Friday and yesterday with leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring game.
Come out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get points on the writing board.
We have a target, and that target is winning this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've long said, I've been focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
It's good to see the players playing in the hard golf course, Bjorn adds: "In this thing I'll never make it my own way.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players are going to advance, and this is a different thing to do.
It's really nice to be out there with a partner when everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your abilities as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to give to all the players, get the best out of yourself for tomorrow's game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his player to play better individually than they did as a jakpan, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the final round of that big game, has been part of the team that won in Brookline before ending with defeat when Europe did "Water in Medina."
"I remember every word of it," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as quickly as you see on Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the moment runs one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in different ways we feel, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight against Rory McIllroy in the upper match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players are in the top order.
"I went with a group of these people in order like this because I thought I could close all the way," said Bjorn about his single choice.
The new German warship was postponed
The latest German Navy patrol ship was supposed to have started in 2014 to replace the old warships, but the ship would not be there at least until the next year because its system was wrong and its cost increased, the local media reported.
The assignment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class guard ship, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting the military speaker.
This ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-shipment issue has disturbed the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that had been commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will come as replacement for the old Bremen-class patrolling ship.
This ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-fly missiles, and anti-kick missiles, as well as some demon technology, such as radar erasers, infrareds, and acoustic keys.
Other important features include a longer period of treatment - should be allowed to use the latest patrolboat for two years away from its harbor.
But the continued delay means this sophisticated warship - which is said to enable Germany to highlight its power abroad - will be wasted at the time of its entry into office, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fate F125 ship had been announced last year, when the German Navy officially refused to ship the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss hull in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the craft after shipping.
Only a few known reasons behind the ship's return, but the German media quoted a number of "software and hardware" that made the warship useless if used for a battle mission.
The lack of software is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by the crew of 120 sailors - only half of the labor force on the older Bremen class warship.
Also, the fact that the boat's bots are very excessive will reduce its performance and limit the capabilities of the Navy to add updates in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this 7,000-ton bobot is believed to be twice as heavy as a ship with similar classes used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to damaged hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including training of ship crews - is also a problem.
It's said to rise surprisingly up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - to rise from the beginning of €2.2 billion.
The problems that are plaguing this latest ship of guards are of great importance in the light of the latest warning given that there is a fall in German naval power.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy actually "exhausted the ship with the ability to spread."
The civil servant says that this problem is getting bigger as the old ships are no longer used but no replacement ships are provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class guards could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats secretly
A new research was done on a farm on the High Plain of Scotland, which aims to reveal how bats use natural branches in their food hunts.
Expected this finding will give new light on this unique flying mammal behavior and help guide the conservation activity in the near future.
Studies by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow a common pipistrelle and sopran and long-earned chocolate bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
Staff NHS and volunteers will also carry out cell surveys using gang detectors.
Sound experts analyzing all recordings will ensure the frequency of bat calls and species that perform what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be designed to draw a picture of the scale of nature detailing their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor for NTS, hopes that this result will reveal which habitat area is most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as grassland production and the best way to preserve the forest for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout England have fallen sharply in the last few centuries.
This bat is threatened by building and developing work that affects the nest and loses habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, such as sticky paper hung to trap bats and chemical treatment of buildings, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated gem location techniques to find insects accurately and barrier on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, cares deeply about bats.
It has ten trained forces, which routinely conduct surveys, nest checks, and sometimes try to rescue.
The organization has also established the first and only natural shelter in Scotland in the Thraveve farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of ten bat species in Scotland.
David Thompson's farm manager says the farm is a region suitable for bats.
"Here in Thrave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there are still many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in the other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of bat testing prior to maintenance in the property, because without realizing the possibility of the destruction of a breeding nest can kill up to 400 female and small bats, which may destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and killed, harassed, or damaged, or destroyed by the nests are illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s office for the Keelawar Trust Conservation, has encouraged the public to join in.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about our bat and for many of our species that we don't know how their population ends up."
Ronaldo, who has refused a rape claim, is preparing a lawyer for the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo calls his rape claim as "false news," and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyer would sue for German news magazine Der Spiegel, which issued the charge.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then supposed to have paid by giving $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in the video Live Instagram broadcast to 142 million followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, objected to the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is fake news," winner Ballon d'Or five times this tells the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's the usual thing.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charge, which they call "a suspicious report in the field of unacceptable privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would ask compensation as "replace moral damages in the amount corresponding to the amount of the infringement, which may be one of the most serious personal rights infringements in the past few years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga were rereported to the player's room, where he was suspected to have raped him, according to a report filed at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayor says Ronaldo kneels after the incident was accused and tells him that "99 percent" he is a "good man" who disappoints only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo confirms that they are both having sex, but it's on the basis of desire together.
Majorga also said he went to the police station and had had a vision of his wounds in the hospital, but then agreed to solve the problem outside the court because he felt "he was afraid to get revenge" and worried "will be humiliated in public."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel that peace settlement because she has been constantly traumatized by that incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italian Juve club with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: England will "forever" regret the loss of car manufacturers
England "will regret forever" if it loses its status as world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, says Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added Toyota, England had told BBC that if England left the European Union without a deal, for the time being it would stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car maker said the border delay impact if there was no deal, it would hurt Brexit in terms of the cost of work.
The factory in Burnaston - which made Auris and Avensis production Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported to the whole European Union.
"My opinion is that if England comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we'll see a production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the director of Toyota enforcer in Burnaston.
Another British car producer has expressed concern about their exit from the European Union without a deal about how the border trade would go, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory at Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem that concerns what the car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chains if there is no deal with Brexit.
Toyota production lines are run on the principle of "timely" production, with a group that enters every 37 minutes of good suppliers in England and the European Union for cars made according to orders.
If England left the European Union without a deal on March 29, there might be a disturbance on the border, which industry believes could cause delays and a lack of joints.
It would be impossible for Toyota to save more than a day's supplies at his factory in Derbyshire, the company's representative said, and thus production would be stopped.
Clark says that Chequers Theresa May's plan to connect with the future European Union is "calibrated properly to avoid border checks."
"We must have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only success at this moment, but for us to get this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4 program today.
"The evidence is not only from Toyota but also from other producers, that we really have to be able to continue what has become a chain of supply that has been very good."
Toyota can't say how long its production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warns that the increase in the cost will reduce the ability of the factory and will ultimately damage the cost of the work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the director of the United Workers' Union in the factory, said his member was more concerned: "As my experience, so much as this job is loose, it will never come back.
The government speaker said, "We've put forward the right plan and made sense for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be back delayed, running the White House
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with the senior deputy prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could "take another week back" because the high court leader Brett Kavanaugh was still on, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsellor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s involvement in public elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia’s servants, and the potential that hinders justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the high-ranking deputy prosecutor, who will endanger Mueller's freedom, has been triggering rumors in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing using telegrams to record conversations with Trump and was likely to release the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein objected to the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of the report that he was going to resign.
On the other hand, a meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose for no" fired Rosenstein, but the meeting was reintroduced to avoid fighting with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual offenses, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both will testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week over a claim against Kavanaugh, which then postponed the full Senate vote.
Secretary of Press Trump, Sarah Sanders, performs on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for that meeting has not been set, perhaps this week, I can see that putting it off to the next week is also good considering the other things that happened in the high court.
But let's just see and I always want to share the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
The bringer of Chris Wallace's show asked why.
Sanders says it's rare to meet isn't because they don't like TV reporters "who are trying to attract attention," though, he says, "I don't agree with the fact that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he suggested that immediate contact between Trump and the press be improved.
"The president did more questions directly than the previous president," he said without saying, "We've seen the numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, says Sanders, but "if press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it more often and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conference with visiting high officials.
Solo press conference rarely occurs.
This week in New York, the president might show us why, doing a free appearance and sometimes weird before the reporters get together.
Health secretary wrote to the workers of the European Union in NHS Scotland about concerns about Brexit's problem
Secretary of Health has written a letter to the European Union staff working at NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope that they will still work here after Brexit's problem.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until England drew itself from the European Union.
The government of Scotland has committed to meet the regular status costs of EU citizens working in the transferred public service.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiation between England and the European Union on this withdrawal is still continuing, approaching the decision expected this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for possible scenarios without a deal.
I know this must be very disturbing to you all.
That's why now I want to reconfirm how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union, and others, brought valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the health service work, and benefit the patients and the society we serve.
Scotland really is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undertook an emergency operation after having suffered head injuries
The backlash of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after having suffered head injuries on the defeat of 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodoros on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Head coach Tennessee, Rod Reed told the injured reporter that soon before the round ended.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell faint there," said Reed.
Coach and medical power gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it in the heat and taking it to further evaluate.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's no detail about the type/level of injury experienced" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the two-tiered student of this red coat, was in her first season with the Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five tekels on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made the total tekels during this season 18 tekels.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher material costs when buying properties in England
Foreign buyers will be charged higher material costs when they buy properties in England, along with additional money that will be used to help the homeless according to a new Tory plan
This step will slow Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The cost of this material will be charged to those who don't pay taxes in England
The Finance Department estimates that it will collect up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be put on higher bea material when they buy properties in England - along with additional money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to curb the success rate of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts in attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high income.
Costs of materials will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in England, along with additional money that encourages efforts by the government to fight annoyance.
Additional costs - which are additional costs at the present cost of materials, including higher levels that were introduced two years ago on the second house purchase and home purchase to rent - can reach three percent.
The Financial Department expects this move to rise to £120 million a year.
It's estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built properties are purchased by non-English people, which cause price increases and make it harder for the first buyer to step up his feet in the housing stairwell.
Many rich areas in this country -- usually in the capital city -- have become a "ghost city" because of the many foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out only a week after Boris Johnson called for cuts in material costs to help more young people have their first home.
He accused the large construction company of maintaining the high price of property by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to ignore quotas for the houses within reach in order to repair "homeless" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of proposals for reform in interesting housing, including rent supervision and ending "free of guilt".
He also wanted to give greater power to the council to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Last time I promised I would devote the prime minister's office to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our homeless housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build lives here.
However, it is not the right thing for people who do not live in Britain, as well as a foreign - based company, to buy homes that are as simple as hard - working British people.
For many people the dream of having a house is a very distant thing, and not an honorable treatment against the vile remains manifest."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambiance is leading the Scotland team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross said his "principal ambition" was to be a Scotland manager on some stage.
The 42-year-old Skotland player, enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently has third rank in League One, which is three points from the top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Premier League of Scotland last year.
"I want to sell my country as a player.
I got a B hat and it was him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scotland team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always became something interesting to me to return.
But that chance will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland manager before Ross among others Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former boss Alloa Athletic said he wasn't afraid to follow the tracks of great names in that big club, after previously refusing the offer from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, today's success will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, there's no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
"Don't be easy to be there, but I might just see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there."
Karier Ross in the management of the team only three years, after some time as an assistant boss in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coach staff in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to third position, and turned St Mirren from the degradation abyss into the winner of the championship title next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he's ever done during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"This may be the intersection of the road that I have to go through," he recalls when taking over Alloa.
"I really believe management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I'm okay, making a living in a reasonable way, and enjoying some things that are reasonable.
But playing can be hard.
A lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still experiencing it in terms of working pressure, but in managing it it's okay.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I've done it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt throughout my adult life."

Summer waves have increased the revenues of pubs in Britain who are struggling to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
Numbers show, pubs and bars saw sales rise of 2.7 percent in July - but revenues at restaurants drop by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, the CGA business consultant, who compiled those numbers, said: "The sun that shines brightly and participates in the British World Cup longer than expected means, the month of July will follow the same pattern as the previous month of June, where the revenue of the pubs increases by 2.8 percent, except the restaurant that gets a hard hit.
The drop in the restaurant trade of 1.8 percent in June will get worse in July.
The sales of pubs and bars that sell drinks so far perform the strongest compared to what happened at the restaurant that came down.
The pub that sells food also suffers from the heat of the sun, even though the restaurant operators are not separate.
Looks like people just came out to drink.
Selling all over the pubs and bars that sell drinks up 6.6 percent for this month, with those selling food down three percent."
Paul Newman, recreation analysts and RSM hotels said: "This has continued the train we've seen since April.
The weather and the impact of big sports or social events remains the biggest factor in the sale of the market outside the home.
It is not surprising that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, even though the decline in sales of 4.8 percent from year to year will be very painful on the current cost pressures.
Long summers should not come when the operators who sell food have bad times, and time will tell us if the temperatures we've enjoyed in August will give you a little rest."
The total growth in sales throughout the pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, is 2.7 percent in July, showing the roadblock on the brand launch.

One of five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
Survey revealed, one in five children -- some of them are still 11 years old -- have a secret social media account that they hid from their parents and teachers.
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the development of the "False Institute" page
This news has increased the concern that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have "especially" accounts to show to their parents
One of five children - some of them are still 11 years old - made social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid development of "False Institute" - a reference to photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has increased the concern that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they operate the "especially" account that has been cleared to be shown to their parents, while they also have a personal account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, found a teenager who asked someone else to "rape me."
Research carried out by British Digital Awareness and Conference of the Head of the School of Women" (HMC) from independent schools, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
Chief HMC, Mike Buchanan says, "It's so disturbing that many teenagers try to create an online space that their parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice for athletes in the Scottish Atlantic Council
Eilidh Doyle has been selected to join the Scottish Atlantic Council as non-executive director at the annual meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is a skirmishing athlete and a Scottish field most widely praised and the leader Ian Beattie describes this movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sports field to benefit from various experiences at the international level for the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we believe that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the council," said Beattie.
Doyle says, "I acted as a voice for athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
America's athletics, which won 200 meters and 400 feet in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the total of four Olympic gold medals and now become this BBC expert, cannot walk now after a moment's ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I suffered from a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said it was only a time to determine if I could recover and to what level the recovery was.
It's a very exhausting job to get back to full recovery, learn how to walk back, and today perform a stairway practice!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The breast pump advertising comparing mothers with cows has split opinions in the world online
The pump company has split the world’s opinion online with an advertisement that compares mother’s breast-feeding to an on - line cow.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the first silent breast pump in the world," Elvie consumer technology company released an advertisement inspired by video music genres to show the freedom given this new pump to express a mother.
Four moms dance in the barn with a cow hay followed by a song that reads like this: "Yeah, I'm blushing myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you don't notice this isn't ambling, this is my tits."
It continued with refrain: "Pumpa out, pump out, I feed them baby, pump out, pump out, pump out, I milk my woman."
However, the advertisements published on this company’s Facebook page have led to online controversy.
With 77,000 seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received varied reactions from viewers, many of whom say this causes "worship" in the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision using cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows must also be pregnant and give birth to milk, unless their baby is stolen from them within a few days after giving birth," he wrote.

Another comment: "Trauma that can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But why don't you use it to advertise the breast pump for the mother who has to take care of her baby?"
The others added: "An ad that is lost in meaning."
Others defend the commercial, with a woman confessing that she found the song "funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'll buy it if I still suck.
Measuring makes me feel exactly like a cow.
It's kind of crazy, but I accept what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote someone.
Others comment: "This is a pleasant commercial for mothers who blackmail (often at their place of work or toilets) and who feel like "the cow."
This is not a commercial that praises or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps that were stuck in their arms.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the insight of many women who blackmailed ASI who said they felt like cows.
However, Elvie Pump really hening, without cables or tubes and paces in the bra nourishing, which gives women freedom to move, carry their babies, and even go out while pressuring.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother's comments: "Elvie pump is a reportable product launched convincingly and provocatively.
Comparing the image between expressing women and our sword cow we want to pump the ASI and all its challenges, and showing it by way of comfort and enjoyment with the full freedom of the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie pump became the headline news.

Hundreds of Big Boys Moving Quietly to Camp Camp in Texas Border
The number of migrant children who are being held up is increasing even though the crossing of the monthly borders is still unchanged, partly due to strong statements and policies introduced by Trump's government that make child care difficult with sponsors.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are immigrants without documents, and fear of endangering their own ability to stay in that country by moving forward to save children.
The risk increases in June, when the federal government announces that future sponsors and other adult members of their households have to deliver fingerprints, and the data will be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the field of Immigration and Cuckoo, testified before Congress that the institution had captured dozens of people who applied to support children under a long age.
The agency then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a history of criminal records.
"About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of sponsoring groups are illegally in this country, and most of them are evil foreigners.
So we keep hunting those people," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials introduce new rules that require some of them to attend court within one month after being arrested, not after 60 days, which became the standard before, the tutoring officer in the shelter.
Most of them perform through video conference calls, not directly, to plead their legal status case to the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unworthy of help will be deported directly.
The longer the children were arrested, the more likely they were becoming more anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape efforts, the workers' talks where shelters and the system reports received in the last few months.
The lawyers say that the concern is increasing in a larger facility like Tornillo, which has signs on a child who is struggling tends to be ignored, because of its size.
They say that moving children to the camp town without giving them enough time to prepare for them emotionally or saying good-bye to their friends can make a lot of trauma worse.
Syria asked the US, French and Turkish 'insurgency forces' to retreat immediately
Speaking in the UN General Council, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return, even though the state war had now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as prime minister's representative, said foreign forces were illegally occupying Syrian territory, on grounds of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with with in all respects."
"They must retreat as soon as possible and without any conditions," the statement to the council.
Moualem points out that the "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than millions fleeing their homes.
He asserts that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy battle until we clean up all Syria's territory" from terror groups and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially training and influencing Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
The French had over 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn state.
With regard to refugee issues, Moualem confirmed that they should return immediately, and he blamed "a number of western countries" for "declaring an extraordinary fear" that spurred refugees to move away.
"We've asked international society and humanity to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politicize what should be a whole humanitarian problem."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until the political agreement between Assad and opposition to end the war was agreed.
The UN diplomats said the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel fortress has given rise to an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevents large-scale attacks by Russian-supported Syrian troops in the province, where there are three million people living.
But Moualem asserts that the agreement has "clear time" and gives rise to the hope that military action will target the mujahids among the fighters of the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, which "will be overthrown."
UN Mission Staff de Mistura hopes to quickly announce the first new committee meeting made up of the government and opposition members to make the post-war invitation for Syria and open the way for general elections.
Moualem set out the terms of the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, insisting that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the latest points of call," and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win the public election again in 2020 unless, because many liberals hope, prosecution and scandals will soon end his presidency.
No doubt, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
Until now, no sign of weariness for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's main hour rating has increased more than double to 1.05 million and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million main-time audiences, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has reached the peak of cable TV with 3.5 million main-time audiences.
"It's a spirit that makes people interested in being something that they don't understand," said Neal Baer, an ABC actor "Designed Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who was president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author "Just the Funny Parts: And some hard truths in sneaking into Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
He remembered riding a cab in Boston before the general election in 2016.
The driver said he'd give Trump his voice.
Why?
"He said, "Because he made me laugh," Miss Scovell told me.
Value of entertainment could be confused.
Of course, unlike any other event on TV, the story from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family can reunite and restore the global economy.
On the other hand, luxury can only be felt by the most special audience.
However, not just being a citizen of the country who was aware at six o'clock you found yourself witnessing the panel of experts discussing the use of the "background" source Bob Woodward for his book called "Fear," wearing Paul Manafort's camel's coat of arms worth $15,000 ("best dress with pride," The Washington Post) and the implication of Stormy Daniels' terrible description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"By the policy he does, he makes it just like a real event that comforts you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator "Pawn Stars," about the performance players and the course of Trump's daily story (choosing an enemy with NFL, commends Kim Jong-un).

When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it felt bright 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kaai, but he hid while watching MSNBC and CNN recording.
He couldn't free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh prepared to face the Senate Justice Committee and the next Supreme Court according to his balance.
"I remember when we held all the crazy shows on that day and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's like a joke, but it turns out they're right."

There's a lot of money out there flooding the most tight-time half-election competition in the White House.
Pennsylvania 17 is only reasonable to obtain a cash flood, thanks to the rescheduled convention district that has served two years in the same seat-bathing.
The Pittsburg District was recently re-established, introducing Conor Lamb of Rep. Democracy - which won seats in another district through the special elections last spring.
Lamb moved forward against another year, Keith Rothfus Republic, now representing the old district of Pennsylvania 12, which is dominated by the new district of Pennsylvania 17.
These maps were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were non-constitutionally on the side of the Republican party.
The competition in the new Pennsylvania 17 district has resulted in massive campaign funding between the big party's finance side, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and National Republican Campaign Committee (NRRC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in the March special election that was held in public for Congress District 18 Pennsylvania.
The seat had been occupied by the Republican Party official for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the 20-point district.
Political experts sent the Democratic Party a little higher.
The U.S. is on the move to execute the punishment of El Salvador for supporting Turkey, then back
Diplomats made sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized Beijing, giving a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and booked hotels in Panama until the partner expelled the Trump Organization management team.
Foreign Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the latest rulings that no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, appeared in an earlier statement this month.
But the punishment was only considered against El Salvador, who had received help for some $140 million from America in 2017, including for drug control, support for development and economics.
The proposed legislation, which includes the abolition of financial aid and the limitation of visas, will harm the Middle American state and raise the unemployment and murder levels.
As the internal meeting took place, the North and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to continue the same meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, high government officials confirmed that they wanted further conferences, so that they could effectively end the trial of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech in that conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal made by the government at the meeting, the opening of diplomats.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new reprimands or punishments from Washington.
One of the White House speakers for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that three U.S. officials had in mind, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal views of this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts who were close to the government and also spoke about this unclear situation.
Study Story
Another surprising story is Robert Mueller's special advisor's report on the possible impedance of Mr. Trump's trial, which now has very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discussed his investigation whether Trump's campaign is collating with Russia in attacking our general election.
When Congress moves hands, Mr. Trump will be asked for responsibility from him, just as he prepares to go again in front of the electors, and may eventually become a jury of his partners.
So there's still a lot to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's reign cannot be avoided - or his equality in Europe.
There's a choice we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take a coup against Hitler, if only the West were against him and to support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The beginning of history revolves around all such intersections, and the fast - paced or postponed democracy halls cannot be avoided.
Now Americans face some of this change.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the one who watches the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since then. This report reports that, last year, she suggested that she secretly film the president and that she felt she wasn't worthy of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account wasn't right.
"How do we respond if the new F.B.I. investigation asked by Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or fair--or if he was brought to the Supreme Court despite strong accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to give a half-time voice to Congress that will call for Trump's accountability?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse in a long time.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lesson I've learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that ever inhabited my big embassy.
She survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a candle on the table that writes swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope for our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans feels optimistic about the game facing Rapid Vienna
Rangers invited Rapid Vienna on Thursday, a full victory over Austria, to follow the good results in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will strengthen their position to escape from Group G of the European League.
The knee injury made Graham Dorrans' mid-hunt can't perform this first season until 2-2 against Villarreal, but he's sure Rangers can take advantage of the result as a pajamas to greater hope.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal was a great team," the 31-year-old speaker.
"In this game we're sure we can get something and go by swinging one point.
In the end, we might be able to do that, but we believe, the results can be just.
In the first round, they might be better but in the second round, we got up and became a better team.
Starting on Thursday, tonight is another European big day.
We hope we can count on three points even though they're going to be a tough match because they have good results in their last match, but, with support behind us, I'm sure we can keep going forward and get positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself but now there's a very good hope in this club.
This squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's good practice.
May we now develop, put the past behind us and achieve success."

Although the surveyers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few people would argue with their family members about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the long-term care costs with their partners.
Only 10 percent of them said to discuss this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start the discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it's time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: you won't be able to prepare your own family to provide care if you don't tell them your wishes first.
Be humble with counsellors and your family, where and how you get care, because what you choose will mean very important in determining the cost.
Deal with your financial advisors: Your advisors can certainly give you his help in showing you how to pay those costs.
The maintenance you choose for long-term care includes traditional long-term insurance policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that guarantee these costs or assure yourself of your own wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal document: In view of the legal debate that is intrusive.
An immediate sign of power for your health care, that is, someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee if your desire is carried out by professionals when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, the letter of authority in the matter of financial matters should also be considered.

A man shot a wind rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind rifle on his way home from a party at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several times shots on his chest, stomach, and hands.
The shooting event was described by the officer at around 2:30 BST, and it was said as "a random act."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries that the victim suffered did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses had been filed by the police.
Earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia
Earthquakes and tsunamis so devastatingly hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, last Friday, had wiped out at least 384 souls, the arrest of the officers, and the estimated number of casualties would increase.
The decommitment has resulted in the aid of officers who have difficulty obtaining information from the Dogalga Regency, a region to the north of the Pallu city that is closer to the earthquake center that hits with the influence of 7.5 Richter scale.
In the Palu, after a disaster, over 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of main facts about the city of Pallu and Dogalga, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu was the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located on the narrow shores of the western coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, this city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Donjaga, in the meantime, is a densely populated region more than 300 km (180 km) from the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
This county, which is an administrative area under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 souls in 2017.
The bottom-up economy in the South Sulawesi province is looking for fish and seasoning, especially on the coast of Dogalga.
Even so, the development of nickel plays an important role in this province, even though most of it is located in Morowali, across the shores of Sulawesi.
Recorded in the past 100 years, Pallu and Donggara have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Relief Board.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes in Dolegama were left standing.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in the western Dogala.
Seismicly, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Ring and therefore the earthquakes will occur in an orderly manner.
A number of earthquakes and large tsunamis that have swept through the last few years are as follows:
The year 2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a major earthquake, just on the west coast of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, to the point of eliminating 226,000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half the dead were in Aceh.
The year 2005: Late in March and early in April, a number of other powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, on the shore of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
The year 2006: The 6.8 - magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, the most dense island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami on the south coast and resulting in nearly 700 deaths by that country.
The year 2009: An earthquake with a 7.6 power struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
The victim died in more than 1,100 people.
In 2010: One of the islands of the U.S. state of Sumatra was hit by a 7.5 - powerful earthquake, triggering a 10 - foot (10 m) tsunami that suddenly devastated dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya, Aceh, also suffered a shallow earthquake and resulted in the destruction, as well as the panic of people who remembered the destruction of the earthquake and tsunami that died last year.
Although tsunamis were not possible this time, more than 100 people died from the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, which is called a tourist island, also experienced a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, where most of them were on the northern side of the island.
The quake spreads thousands of buildings and while it spreads thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and vice president candidate, has been arrested for the attack.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, prevented domestic violence reports and opposed arrest efforts, as reported by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he took the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to Matt-Su Pre-Trial Prison, with $500 fines without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As reported by the news network, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, stating that he was "innocent, sure" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three minor violations of Class A, which could have him sentenced to one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with charges against Class B, with one day's sentence and fines of $2,000.
For Palin, the penalty charge is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report on the alleged attack.
The case is now filed for the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing reports of domestic violence offences, and possession of weapons intoxicated, which also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of looking at his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin had a crisis from a step-by-step veteran group linking her son’s violence with PTSD as a result of her duties throughout Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was hit by a great earthquake until at least 384 victims died.
The 7.5 - scale earthquake of richter’s potentially triggering tsunamis has dropped thousands of homes.
Power grids and communication connections have been cut off, and the death toll is estimated to continue to increase for a few days in the future.
Earthquake at that time hit the middle of Sulawesi, which was located in eastern Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The videos show how widespread the moment of the disaster is through the social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to mark a beach festival in the town of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke the beach.
The federal prosecutor attempted a death penalty that rarely occurred for a terrorist suspect in NYC.
The federal prosecutor in New York attempted a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- the punishment included a rare and has never been carried out in the federal crime-related state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was expected to do an attack by crashing his rented truck from Home Depot on footpaths and bike drivers along the West Side Highway route in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death penalty, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "involuntaryly" killed the eight victims and "involuntaryly" also caused serious bodily injury, on the basis of a declaration of intent to bring down the death penalty, which was filed in the South New York District.
On the basis of court documents, the two defendants are allowed to be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Judiciary imprisoned Saipov with 22 defendants, including eight charges of murder in the launch of a detonation, which usually use federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as allegations of violence and attempted motor vehicle damage.
According to prosecutors, the attack requires "substantial planning and early mating," as a description of Saipov's crime done with "sense, cruel, and savage."
Expressed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims of the incident were tourists from Argentina.
Counting a decade since the New York South District dropped the death penalty last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, charged with killing two drug dealers, was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution of death sentences in the federal court of New York in 1953, was dropped in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were found guilty in a conspiracy espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed with an electric seat on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not show regret as long as it went on day and month after the attack.
When asked by the investigators, he said that he was happy with what he had done, to arrest the police.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that his attack was inspired by the ISIS video on his phone, as it was in the indictment.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, after the police.
He said he was innocent over 22 charges he had been charged with.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said "clearly disappointed" against the prosecution's decision.
"As far as we are concerned, the decision to execute death rather than accept a life sentence sentence without bail will only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident," said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously applied to the prosecutor for a penalty of death.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for the Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage is calling for the people's release today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians had to 'severe heat' Eurosceptics - because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that they participate in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative group supporters, Peter Bone, told street action in Birmingham that England 'should be out' right now if Farage is acting as Secretary of Brexit.
Nevertheless, the challenge facing May in his shared reconciliation has been supported by the supporters of the Remain Tories who joined in the separate protest action framed Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fought to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to remain on his track despite the middle of the Brexitiers, Remainers and the European Union attack.
Allied countries stressed that he would be driven forward to reach a deal with Brussels, even if he had a bad reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to decide between the proposition package and the "clash".
Bone told the masses of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted' to get rid of Chequers.
His suggestion was that Farage should appoint a partner to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he's in charge, we'll be out now," he says.
Members of Parliament Wellingborough added: "I'm ready to stand up to support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
In fact, as soon as he showed his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We do not fight in the world war to be subdued.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Bone says that public opinion may have changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that British thinking has changed and wants the conditions, that's absolutely not true."
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, appeared to reporters: 'Simplely, I want to say: O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Checkers are not popular in the public, while Opposition won't choose it, because it's not popular with our parties and our activists who really come down the road and make us elected in the first position.
Our pleas, get rid of Chequers and start listening to us.'
Through a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister maintains their work when they promise."
Farage said that political demonstrations had to be thwarted in order to 'heat the heat' if they wanted to reject the 2016 referendum decision.
‘This most precious moment is the trust between our people and our political groups,’ he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming to them that 'we will not escape you to do so'.
He added in a message to the enthusiastic community: 'I want you to make our political groups, who are preparing to deny Brexit, and feel the heat.
“ We are moving the roots of this country’s citizens who will win us in Brexit and will never give up until Britain’s independence, sovereignty, and pride come on us. ”
Meanwhile, the Remainers mass moves through Birmingham before announcing action in the city center for two hours.
Activist lines seem to spread the Tories Against Brexit banner after starting the line at the end of this week.
Companions in the Labour line, Lord Adonis, mocking the Conservative group related to the security issue of their party application at the conference opened.
‘These are the people who told us that they can master the IT system and all technology for Canada, whatever, for the anti-exhaustive border, in a range of unrestricted free trade in Ireland,’ he healed.
‘ It really is a stage show.
There's no good Brexit at all,' he heals.

An audience asked him, if there were any plans to run for president.
Warren said, "This is the right time for women to enter the Washington circle in order to restore our corrupt government, and it's also a time for women to sit on top."

Ajang Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after the team admitted his victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear when Valteri Bottas was in front of Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying line on Saturday that would bring Mercedes team orders to have a great role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton because he held his position in the first two round and pulled Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel became the first to drive into the pit and let Hamilton move into the dense at the end of the crowd, something that should be very determined.
Mercedes went into pit one lap after and out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to travel after some follow-up action showing Ferrari driver resistance leaving the inside empty with the risk of surviving after double motion to survive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started on the back of the grid and was in the seventh position at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.

He finally got into the pit in the 44th lap but couldn't raise his step in the eight laps left because finally Raikkonen took fourth position.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did fantastic work all weekend and a real man who let me.
Team has done an extraordinary job to have two," Hamilton said.
It's a Very Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump teased Senator Dianne Feinstein in a religion on Saturday through his village, he didn't disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the sexual violence against the future Judge Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking in a relic in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement made by Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, instead of commenting on what is happening in the senate that shows people who are "evil and filthy and dishonest."
"Something that can happen and something beautiful that's going on in the Senate for the last few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and filthy and dishonest," he said.
"When you see the appearance and the leak and then they say "oh, I don't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak it," plus, as a senator impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter intriguing charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July last, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein had prevented the leak from coming from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's accusation, I'm not leaking the story," Feinstein's words to the committee, told Hill.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it as secret as his request."
But his rejection seemed to be rejected by the president, who commented during the relic on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continue his defense against the next Supreme Judge, who was accused of sexual harassment against three women, the president was impressed by the democratic view that he had used accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see crime, gravity, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk for power and supervision," Mediaite report on the president's speech.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants in front of Dundee
Dundee Stars compensated Friday's defeat at the Elite League when they fought Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 ball game on Saturday's score.
Giant got the top two goals first after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the housekeepers with them before Dwyer returned the Giants.
Francois Bouchard compared Dundee's position to two goals — Luke Lundvald Nielsen’s victory.
It was the defeat of the Third Elit League this season that met Adam Keefe's men, who succeeded in chasing the fall and finally gained the upper hand to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
That's the fourth meeting this season between the two sides, with three Giants wins in the previous game.
The opening of Dwyer was present in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m. of the bait given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the bait when Beauvillier managed to double the grandeur four minutes later.
During a dense opening period, Sullivan brought the landlords back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the foreman for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were at the first break when he released his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The housekeepers rejoined and Bouchard again weighed their position with a goal power play at the time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give a high hand against Dundee for the first time at the end of the game in the second period and he secured a victory with his team in the middle of the fifth during the final period.
Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats of their five games, are in the cage to face Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
Air Traffic Driver Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers on Fired Flyers
An air traffic driver in Indonesia was shunned as a hero after his death while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have disappeared after a massive earthquake struck the Sulawesi Islands on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The violent storms continued to shake the region and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Pallu.
But as soon as his companions fled for their safety, a 21-year-old man, Anthonius Gunahan the Great, refused to leave his post in a heavily shaken guide tower at Sis Al Jufri High School Airport, Palu.
He chose to survive to ensure that the 6321 Waterborne Flight that was at that time on the runway, was safe to take off.
He then jumped from the traffic controller tower when he felt that the tower began to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Speaker of the Indonesian Navigation Service Agency, Yohannes Sirrait, delivered his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from ABC Australia.
We provided a helicopter from Balicpan in California to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost her this morning before the helicopter reached the Palu.
"We're all sad to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities worry that the dead could reach thousands after the National Disaster Relief Agency provided access to the city of Dongga, Sigi, and Boutong.
"The sacrifice is believed to continue to increase because of the number of victims who are still torn apart and many others who cannot be reached," said the national body's spokesman for the disaster relief of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves that reach six meters have made the steps which cause the mass burial on Sunday.
A military and commercial aircraft brought help and supplies.
Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulance carries a body.
Clean water becomes rare.
Minimarkets everywhere in history"
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it may get worse."
President Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived at the Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the duties related to evacuation.
Ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia at the beginning of this year was also hit by an earthquake in the Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia: The Niugini River reported one missing person after the lagoon plane accident
Airplanes operate a flight that falls into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia conveying one person has disappeared, after previously delivered to 47 passengers and crew have been evacuated safely from a sinking plane.
At a release on Saturday afternoon, Niugini was unable to identify a male passenger.
The airline said they had been working with local authorities, hospitals, and inspectors to find the man.
The public was not quick to respond to a more detailed request about the passengers, such as their age or citizenship.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crews, after the aircraft hit the water while landing at Chuuk Island airport.
The officer announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
On Saturday, the airline announced six passengers left in the hospital, and they were all in stable condition.
What causes an accident and a complete sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported a plane landing on the lagoon around the runway.
Some witnesses feel a plane overruns the runway.
U.S. passengers Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's really a good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told him and others were able to cross the waist - high water through an emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He's been sending out panickers and screaming, and he's having a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy says fishermen working close to the repaired docks also help rescue using rubber boats to transport people to land before the plane sinks in the depths of about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Flight Security Network indicates 111 people have died in the world in the crash of the registration-PNG aircraft for the last two decades but not one involving Niugini Water.
Analysts break the line of the night-burning woman alive
The prosecution of what happened on Saturday in re-examination of a man who was accused of burning alive against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Analysis of the U.S. Justice Department Paul Rowlett's testimony for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He made a big line for the jury about how he used his cell phone footage to gather the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received the location data from some cell phones that showed Tellis was at one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to the previous statement indicted, reported Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone was at one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis told the truth when he said that he was in the Sanford truck at night, Sanford said he was "false, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies told by Telllis were his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks before the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate that they know each other within a week.
Rowlett stated that after Chambers died, Tellis sometimes deleted messages, calls and contacts from Chambers' phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," said Hale.
The opening is scheduled to begin the closing statement on Sunday.
The judge stated that he hoped the trial would lead to the jury after that day.

Other black people?!
NY nanny demanded a couple for attacking after sending out a "realistic" message
A New York nurse demanded a couple because they had attacked discriminatively after receiving an indirect message from a complaining mother and saying that she was "the other black man."
The couple refused if they were considered racist, and considered it more like "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anxiety when she realized that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first worked in 2016.
"I DON'T WANT ANY OTHER LIFE," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending it to her husband, she's sending it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, saying that they were taking out a nurse, who was a mixed African-American citizen, because he had done a bad job and he was more expecting the Philippines, based on New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then returned to Uber.
At this point, Maurice demanded the couple to make compensation for the breach, and asked for compensation about $350 a day for the six-month term, in exchange for the loss of the nurse's work that he had to work at first, even if there was no contract.
"I want to show them, see, you can't do anything like that," she said to the Post on Sunday, then add "I know it's discrimination."
The couple opposed the claim that they were racist, that workers who were fired Maurice were a reason to do so, they were concerned that they could not trust him after the offense.
"My wife has sent something she doesn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband said to the Post.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been rude to, even though it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.
Like wrapped up "expression," says Plasco his wife just two months ago gave birth to her baby and was in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone in that condition?
That's not a good thing to do," investment bank adds.
While the legal case is still under way, the court of public opinion has made a quick complaint against the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitudes and logic.
Paddington publisher worried the reader wouldn't have anything to do with the bear talking, the new newspaper revealed
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after her book was accepted, was explained in the letter. "It's hard to just talk without knowing her position, to read it first before it was published.
It's very funny to know how we know about the great achievement of Paddington."
Telling his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspired by writing a child's book with a bear toy, who was very optimistic about the work he had been denied, he added the anniversary of publishing the 60th book that felt "sweet pain" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, who he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of his final success.
"He's rather quiet, and he's not arrogant," he said.
"But because Paddington means so much to him, it's like you have a child who has achieved something: you're proud of them even though not all your efforts.
I think he's looking at the success of Paddington like that.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always praised himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors had failed to rescue her.
"Nad made a quiet call to convey it really bad that he was very likely not to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he'd die in the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors have given them to keep their hearts steady and slow to decay and leave their system.
He's died a few moments of treatment and everything feels dead.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't groan, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now sorry for losing her daughter, boarded a plane with the other passengers - without realizing what had been going through.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head is dizzy and my tears keep dripping all the time.
It's very hard to explain, but during that flight I felt such deep sympathy with Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
The grieving women post cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones were trying to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge on Welsh with inspirational messages and numbers that can be reached for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel as I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that it's a good smile."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying if there's any further effect."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can approach and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit and shut up-- you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who's been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed changes in his behavior.
He's at his lowest point on Christmas Day--when the kids open their gifts he doesn't see to their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a big trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "That's making a gap in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to get through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was in uncertainty when the FBI started its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking for -- an investigation that limits time, limits the scope -- we might be able to bring some unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the "destruction" committee in the middle of the council's bankruptcy.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their denial is due to time.
The legislative election is five weeks away, on November 6, - if, as expected, the Republic does it badly, they will become very weak in their opportunity to make the person they want to be chosen sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him meets his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats sit.
Still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean drivers under Kim
The number of people who have been reeling from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un-powered seven years ago, after having a member of the South Korean parliament.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Union Ministry data, says there were 1,127 handlings last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said border control between North Korea and China and the higher fares imposed by smugglers were the key factors.
Pyongyang does not give a public comment.
Most Northerners were finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said over 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through Turkey, which had the longest border with North Korea and were easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
Chinese treats smugglers as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return.
The relationship between the North and the South - which technically is still in war - has greatly increased in the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the two country leaders met in Pyongyang for a discussion that centered on the negotiation of the postponed necrolysis.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between the president of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work together on a nuclear-free Korean border.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blames US sanctions for lack of development ever since.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, there can't be any way we'll drop our weapons separately," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the UN General Council in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh "hissteris," said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The opposition party leader Nancy Pelosi accused the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of "hissterism" and said he didn't fit in temperament to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman's performance like that, they'll say 'hissterism'," Pelosi said about his reaction to the Kavanaugh witness in front of the Judicial Council Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally objected to the accusation that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes screaming and it was hard to talk when discussing his family and his years during high school.
He also openly condemned Democracy in the committee, saying that the charge against it was "unreasonable and coordinated character killing" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's witness proved that he couldn't serve the Supreme Court because he was poor about democracy.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and his attitude toward Clinton and Democracy," he said.
Pelosi objected if he would try to sue if he agreed, and if Democracy gained more voice at the People's Representative's Council.
"I'll say like this -- if he doesn't really tell Congress or FBI, then he doesn't fit just to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he was a Democrat he was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision against the Health Services or Roe v. Wade, because he was regarded as a conservative sense of justice.
In the decision-making congregation, Kavanaugh avoids the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone hysterical and rude to go up to the court and expect us to say, 'Is it not so great,' said Pelosi?
And women need to handle it.
It's an etiquette, anger for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry, Miss Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"It's not strange to me, what do you think?"
And he went on, and said, I am helped by a woman that is an executive in some place, saying that she also wept when she was angry, but developed a technique which means that she was angry, and began to cry; and she said unto him that talked with her, Thou mightest think that I was sad, because I was weeping.
I'm angry."
And then he goes on.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears were released as a way out of anger because he was essentially misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, at a male-dominated office, once when I cried with unexpressable anger, was that my shoulder was shaken by an older woman -- a cold manager who was always a little afraid -- who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they're working."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, very frustrated, understanding that there was no reason for himself not to run himself as president.
"It's not a mature decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There are still seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone calls it "Snow Princess and Seven Dwarves."
Since it was too late in the campaign, he was left behind in the fundraiser, so he swore he would not follow the election unless he had managed to raise $2 million.
It's a fight to defeat.
He found out that some of his supporters gave him $1,000 to the guy just gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
When he announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overpowered by emotion - thanks to the people who supported him, frustration with a system that made fundraisers so difficult and to target voters from delegations, and anger against sexism - made it difficult to talk.
"You might think that I'm too nervous," recalls Miss Schroeder about how the press reacted to him.
"You'll think that Kleenex is my sponsor company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write in my mind?
"She's crying?"
How U.S.-Tiokok's trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening of the US - Chinese trade competition was so devastating, and when the fight was still far from over, the circle between the two countries might have been beneficial for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing Chinese key export goods including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
Very significant coverage is done from the start of this week with a new rate that affects $200 billion dollars (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods entered into the U.S. through Tiokok.
Beijing has repaid every time, recently charged five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has been begging to combine the United States once and for all, and the world's second largest economy will not change in the near future.
Telling Washington to back off means following the will, but publicly turning to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, US trade competition pressures can positively support China in the long term by reducing dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that the fast political decision by Washington or Beijing can create conditions that trigger economic movement in both countries is more dangerous than what we've seen before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
'Prepared' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says that they are ready to return to volunteer refugees and offer help to rebuild a country that has been destroyed by over seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Council, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country were improving.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of terrorism to return it as it once again.
All conditions are now present because refugees are returned voluntarily to countries that they should leave because of terrorism and the global economic decisions that make their lives a day and their livelihoods a target.
The United Nations estimated more than 5.5 million people in Syria have been displaced from their country since the war began in 2011.
The six million others who still live in that country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem says the Syrian regime will receive help to rebuild a devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any assistance or conditional assistance from countries that support rebellion.
