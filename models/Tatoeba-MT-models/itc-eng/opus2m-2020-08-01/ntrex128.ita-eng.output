Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned about "making the figure of clowns"
Some Members of the House are amazed at the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of Parliament of Wales).
This proposal came out as a result of the programmes to amend the name of the Assembly in Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the entire political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that "it can rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who don't live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means cretin and pwp means poach.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed to be "open" to change the name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (palm).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is similar to the English pronunciation of the letter U Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently in the process of drafting amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on any descriptors as to what will be called the members of the House be of course a subject of debate for the members themselves."
The law of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which has given broad support to the possibility of calling the Parliament of Wales.
As regards the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove to be a big deal for President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the operation of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedons go to the polls for the referendum on the modification of the country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "North Macedonia Republic."
The popular vote has been organized in an attempt to put an end to an ongoing dispute with neighbouring Greece for decades, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long stated that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for accession to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for the modification of the name, said he would not take account of the result of the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is simply the price to be paid to be able to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent while the churches of Harlem are in difficulty
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"Today there's neither."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he explained.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood halls that people regularly attend."
As far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and they will come back to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condominiums filled with the type of people who will not help the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for this reason they will hasten the time when these churches will completely close because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by fraternists before Harlem became a black district - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The early white Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation with the head of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against 125th street dealers, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote colour people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s parishioners planned its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it in a different way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a color musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who passed to a larger carillon at Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July concerning its concerns that the diocese "searched to download costs" on the parish assembly although the latter had not been involved in the recruitment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark wounds a thirteen-year-old in lobster fishing dive in California
Official sources state that on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was immersing himself in search of lobster in California, during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV of San Diego that for half an hour he was immersing with friends Saturday morning when he heard a guy scream and swimd up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first it was just enthusiasm due to the capture of a lobster but then "he realized that the boy was crying 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
Her whole clavicle was torn," she said she noticed Hammel once she reached the boy.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the hospital Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized under critical conditions.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said during a communication to the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper thoracic area.
The authorities banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's programme a boost to the beauty products sector in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the important drive towards the UK's UK £2.8 billion beauty products market, which continues to grow while sales in fashion and household items decrease, the biggest courses dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 shops in the country and adopted in more shops next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use the space on shelves once dedicated to TVs, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double the size of its offer of beauty articles up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most of the products are vegan - a quality that is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop dealer will experiment with authorizations in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, southern London, while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a shift towards the purchase of small quantities of food daily at small neighborhood stores forced supermarkets to commit themselves more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the sales outlets will look more and more like the big stores while the supermarket chain tries to oppose discount resistance like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced the Argos sales outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced several Habitat since it purchased the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has given impetus to food sales and has made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to give enamel to its departments of beauty products and pharmaceuticals ended up in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended up in a dispute about the division of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets into supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical activity three years ago in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £ 125 million.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of a wide range of luxury brands of skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Manager of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and inviting environment and convenient positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "furicious" after Holly Willoughby moves from an agreement of 11 million pounds
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones is furious after the hoster Holly Willoughby retired from an 11 million-pound contract with her trendy brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of homemakers and Truly accessories.
The couple's activity had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's.
This Morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce her abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, furious after withdrawing from their profitable trendy brand activity at the last minute to focus on his outstanding new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furicious" when the golden girl on TV admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - did not leave her enough time to dedicate to their brand of truely housewives and accessories.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and it had been calculated that it would double the assets of Willoughby, estimated around 11 million pounds.
As soon as 37-year-old Willoughby chose Instagram to announce his truly abandonment, Jones left Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's highest priority.
It had to be its long-term future that would have engaged her for the next twenty years.
His decision to give up has left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters of Marlow, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this Morning's presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions due to strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby conceived Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together and Jones had a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as a guest of the ITV program "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones said last night that "he doesn't want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have judged "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "television conductor".
"I have not given up anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first event in Singapore in June was acclaimed by Trump as an enormous step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearisation are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho turned to world leaders during the UN General Assembly held on Saturday, which North Korea did not observe an "equivalent response" from the US to the first disarmament operations in North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out, the USA is continuing to impose sanctions to maintain high pressure.
Trump has given a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are achieving excellent results," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the liberation of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded field, we'd have about 200 people right here," said Trump, indicating the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations had been informed that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, the national emergency had not been declared an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutope, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid.
In view of the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other coasts.
The obvious lack of an alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm had been given, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo has put at the heart of his campaign the improvement of Indonesian brand infrastructures and has poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit Joko's administration while preparing for re-election next year.
Joko must also face pressures from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been removed from their homes because of clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who are fighting using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimental weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool matches against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea with a point at the 89th minute Saturday in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 metres from Chelsea gate, with his team below for 1-0.
He touched the left ball before he threw it on the second pole.
The attempt went high above the door frame as it turned to the upper right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga by sneaking into the network.
"Just try to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as fast as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and I touched and I didn't think too much and I pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at the 25th minute marked by the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blue centerer went from heel to Mateo Kovacic before sliding away near the middle camp and taking off in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick transition to half field.
So he performed a beautiful passage that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard passed the defense and finished on the second pole with a left-wing goal beyond Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the round phase of the Champions League at 15.00 on Wednesday at St. Paul Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 15.00 on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters was declared Sunday morning.
A number of people were reported trapped among the masonry of the collapsed buildings following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck the country on Friday and generated waves up to 6 meters high, reported the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, has been wiped out of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman gets stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in the morning with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police have invited people who might have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just at the beginning but I would like to appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead and that he has seen or heard something suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, in particular the taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on Dashcam, to contact us because he could have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found is resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location of the rendezvous this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have stated that they are currently informing the victims' families.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment but has been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He ran out of words when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
Keep saying "it's terrible."
At 1400 two police vans were located inside the demarcated area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were within the demarcated area by checking the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about this is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at number 0800 555 111 indicating register 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument struck by the wave of "the rewrite of history"
His departure would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "follia" and a "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace became a goal.
The iconoclasty during British civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent performance of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many consider should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case of the monarchy.
That this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle seventeenth century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents a part of this fracture.
His results as a Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer pig barks a Chinese farmer killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in South-West China based on news from local media.
The man, identified only with the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severe artery, covered with blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs vaccines in a herd on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
It is reported that he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood on his nose.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had crushed the farmer, according to the declarations.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and macillate," said the cousin identified with the surname "Wu", as reported in Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or the cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig has been locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while the police are collecting evidence on the crime scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the death of the farmer.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "catalyst."
"They just want to play.
They're funny, very curious... they don't want to do harm.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa's strips will carry heavy rains in the south-west of the USA
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on North Mexico and on the South-West coast of the USA in the next few days.
Rosa recorded winds up to 138 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a sack is being formed on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the western coast of the USA. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong tropical humidity north, in the south-western part of the USA.
Rosa will carry up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during Monday.
Thus, tropical humidity in contact with approaching bag will create heavy and vast rainfall in the south-west area in the next few days.
At local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous sudden floods, streams of debris and possible debris in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, especially in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is planned in some areas of the south-west, in particular in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods may occur with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rains could make the river canyons full and the storms will bring wind to bubbles and raise dust.
The approaching sack will cause heavy local rains on part of the southern California coast.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery carts.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the wet season.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona towards the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rains become more widespread at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will come down on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong fluctuations of temperatures in the USA as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to important changes in temperature over short distances.
An outstanding example of sensitive temperature differences in the Central US will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm beginning of October is expected for most Central and Eastern USA, with 26 °C from Southern Plains to the north-east.
In New York you will be able to reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate a strong probability of temperatures above the average for the Eastern US until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audience
More than 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the successful deposition by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would happen in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with the broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute event on Friday: an agreement devised by the senator of Arizona Jeff Flake so that the FBI conducts a one-week investigation on the charges.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Commission that it is 100% sure that Kavanaugh slapped her in a state of drunkenness and tried to strip her off during a party at the superiors.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposition, claimed to be 100% sure that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, this is a hearing similar to that for a football playoff game or for Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, drove all the networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the entire audience, reported Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that it would have voted in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was taken back by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He remained with his eyes low for several minutes while he was scolded and live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told "She has power while many women are helpless."
Flake stated that his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have had other things to say during the hearing of the committee.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present the appointment of Kavanaugh to the whole Senate for one vote.
But Flake said that he would only do so with the certainty that the FBI would analyse the charges against the candidate during the following week, as requested by the minority democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made her decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have had the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump started an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political doing" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused those who criticize his programmes of letting the European Union "politically face" with the future of Britain and of jeopardizing national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the Prime Minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers agreement for Brexit, stating that a proposal according to which Britain and the EU have to collect their respective duties is "absolutely ridiculous"
Wayde Sims murder: police arrest the suspect of the death of the player of the LSU Dyteon Simpson
Police arrested a suspect of Wayde Sims' firearm death, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and taken to prison on charge of second-degree murder, declared Baton Rouge's police department.
The authorities released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered their glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB TV station affiliated to CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted that he accidentally shot Wayde.
The security was set at $350,000, the defence attorney informed.
East Baton Rouge's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for the fugitives of the State of Louisiana, the police scientist's lab, the Southern University police and the local citizens who assisted the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU athletic director thanked the forces of the zone order for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20.
The 198 cm attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where also his father, Wayne, played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rounds per game.
Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team is "disturbed" and "under shock" for Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at all times," Wade said.
Vulcan sprinkles ashes Mexico City
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity had increased in the crater and there had been 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center was checking the different rhombs and shakes.
Images on social media have shown subtle layers of ashes covering the windshield of cars in Mexico City district as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity in correspondence with the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the Pro-Independence Pro-Independence Pro-Democrats had clashed with police riot squads and thousands of people joined in opposing demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by the anti-smoker police targeted the cops with eggs and threw powder paint, creating cloudy dust darks in the streets that usually overflow tourists.
There have been further collisions during the day with police officers who have used manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independentists who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" were confronted with the demonstrators of unionists who shouted "Long life in Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for minor injuries received during the events.
Tension remains high in the Independentist region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the Government of Madrid but recognized by Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the influx had been low, and the Catalans opposed to the secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police had tried to stop with violent clashes the referendum that was taking place at headquarters throughout the region.
The independent groups had camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narciss Termes, 68 years old, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he had no hope of the possibility that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I have seen my parents cry with joy for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory although it was measured at the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the most well-known leaders of the movement who find themselves in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the referendum organization and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with his phone the protest in support of the police, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians of the two factions.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial from the end of last year, announced that he will be running for the elections of the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after explosion of a house with cars
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly hit a Londonderry house with a car.
The accident occurred at Ballenagaard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a ballast at some point.
The attack by Menga marks the victory of Livingston to 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston signed the victory
Livingston already promoted has left the Rangers astonished relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as director of the Hebox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference while Gary Holt's team went to second division with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team therefore remains without a win outside home in the Premiership this season and will have to face next Sunday the first in the Hearts ranking, from which they separate 8 points.
On Thursday the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the League Europe.
Meanwhile, the Livingston continues its series of victories in the division remaining beaten for six games, with Coach Holt who still has to see a defeat since Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston squanders opportunities against incisive guests
Holt's team should have been in advantage long before the goal, with their immediacy that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson found out but dragged his action in front of the mirror of the door and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after he entered to meet Craig Halkett's head shot from the other side of the door.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have put the visitors in trouble with plazas.
And that was how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers gave a kick of punishment and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson were able to pass to Menga, which he could mark from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the possession of ball but the host team's defense had proved impenetrable and the carrier Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This pattern was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped at the foot of Rangers Allan McGregor's doorkeeper and Lithgow shot out of another Livingston game scheme.
The cross has happened in the Livingston area and have been continuously neutralized, while two demands for rigour, after Halkett's contrast with Glenn Middleton's substitute and one for failure of hand, have been refused.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and employees have changed very little from their return to maximum series, but we must give much credit to Holt for the way he has been able to spron the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, head of a masterly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were not inspired.
Despite excellent performance at some times with Gerrard, in this case they have fallen well below these standards.
The last step has been missed - only once have they managed to penetrate the opposing area - and can be considered an alarm bell for the Rangers, who are in half rank.
Erdogan received with contrasting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
This was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, aimed at distancing relations between NATO allies.
Topics such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU have been discussed.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have motivated the intervention with security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Road impact in Deptford: cyclist dies in battle with a car
A cyclist died in battle with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic road of Deptford, in the south-eastern part of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the blow.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died, invested by a street pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident took place on Saturday.
The metropolitan police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads and buses have been blocked and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: You are wounded guards during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a high-security male prison breakdown, reported to the prison office.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin's highest-security male prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST around Sunday and is still in progress.
The specialized agents "Tornado" were used to manage the riot, involving eight prisoners and confined to a prison wing.
Agents were treated on the spot for mild facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: "A specially trained prison person has been deployed to contain an accident currently under way in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer prison sentence."
Long Lartin prison is home to over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the warden of the prison had to receive hospital treatment following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-smoker agents were called to intervene in prison to create a violent riot during which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (of which the drought-affected areas could benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression strikes Arizona, but it is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the last energies of hurricane Rosa will cross the south-west of the desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The national meteorological service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona to South and Eastern Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday in the evening with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the border of Arizona."
The most recent models of the National Center for Hurricanes include precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with peaks isolated up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west area, including Central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will receive from 2.5 cm to 5 cm of rainfall, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For extraneous areas at risk of sudden floods, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of these rainfall will probably be positive because the south-west area is currently going through a drought period.
According to the Drying Monitoring Centre, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing an extreme drought period, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
Initially, the route of hurricane Rosa will reach the land through the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained the hurricane force Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north to 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high flood risk.
"We expect rainfall between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-west area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, to then head through Arizona and towards the southern Utah in late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or its ravages are heavy rainfall in Baja California, the north-west area of Sonora and the south-west desert zone of the USA," the National Hurricane Center reported.
These rains are expected to generate sudden floods potentially lethal and streams of debris in the deserts, as well as free on mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys in a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in the Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the area Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST about Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, reported Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who may have taken over with the telephone what has happened.
Trump states that Kavanaugh "suffered for the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh has "suffered for the evil and anger" of the democratic party during the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh filed before the Congress on Thursday, denying passionately and decisively Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual violence against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also filed the hearing defending himself against the charge.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people could observe Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the minds of the most experienced law of our time, a lawyer with unprecedented public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President made a direct reference to the appointment of Kavanaugh by talking about the importance of republican influx to midterm elections.
"Five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I really do," he said.
"For this lot strictly for exceptional candidates."
Trump said the democrats are committed to "resisting and hindering."
The first fundamental procedural vote of the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place not later than Friday, according to what the CNN told a senior assistant in the GOP direction.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami, and the numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away from giant waves that fell on the beaches, when a large earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi said on Saturday the authorities.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu Friday, when high waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach at dusk, sweeping away many people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, becoming victims," said Jakarta Sutope Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit anything on the mainland," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people went up on trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the Disaster Agency have shown numerous buildings and shops destroyed, counter bridges and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Assessing shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes has been perceived in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the heavy earthquake of Friday was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were dispersed.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dogalga, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralysed, with no information" by Dongaga, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that his staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This and already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had arrived at the time the alarm had been launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, one feels a man on a top floor of a building shouting agitated way to warn people about the coming tsunami in the street below.
A few minutes after a water wall fell on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but displaced persons still need food and other necessities.
The city airport has been reopened only for rescue and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget for tsunami victims in Indonesia goes up to more than 800.
It's terrible.
Although the World Vision staff of Domanga managed to reach healthy and save the city of Palu, where employees took refuge under shelters of waxed canvas in their office yard, during the journey they encountered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
"I was told to have seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while relief groups have started the difficult start-up operations of rescue gears, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign rescue operators with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian regulations determine that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can start to arrive only if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And that has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster", we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
The second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, the friends and family of the dispersers still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a child was extracted from a discharge.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the preparer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the dispersal paragliding pilots.
Other people trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding sector, I am carrying my emotional load," he said.
Gendon related how, in the hours following the spread of news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single sign of grey output rather than two blue signs.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a refuelling of ATMs in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a ATM in the entertainment centre and preparing to deliver another money, said investigator Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "is found behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag with the money destined for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects who fled the crime scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
The kidnapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday's announcement of the change of name on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change took place before his participation in the Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", declared the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We passed from Kanye, which means the only, to simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our evilness, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
It's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
An ex-collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has also changed the name with or without indents and capital letters.
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful event in the square on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people at a time when the student movements on the left were taking foot throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by expanding monthly student support and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for the IA
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the research funds in this field, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements from different groups of the US government regarding AI, although in the USA in general there is a lack of a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its programme last year: it plans to be country 1 in innovation AI by 2030.
"Redouble the budget in search of the IA would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in the IA," said Lee.
The duplication of funding could double the chances that the next major success in the IA sector will be achieved in the USA, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat the American player of Otello with the highest score and later was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled the previous technological competitions of the U.S. government such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when to hold the next one, to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the USA often have to work a lot to get money from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking the leaders away from the academic field, it's the multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired lights from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee stated that changes to immigration policy could help the USA to boost its efforts in the context of AI.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in AI," he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations distribute funds to researchers in the USA, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has created a joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities and the White House has announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million a year in I.A. research.
In the meantime, the US order to create a National Committee on Artificial Intelligence Security has not been active for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum for the change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of the country to the "North Macedonia Republic", a move that would resolve the dispute for decades with Greece which blocked its applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that its neighbours' name constitutes a claim on its territory and has placed the veto on Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments have concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority of the people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum and the boycott campaign gave rise to doubts about the possibility that the flow would reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The application on the referendum sheet is as follows: "It agrees with the accession to NATO and the EU and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is the price to be paid so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries of the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority standing.
The State Election Committee stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
However, the influx was only 16% compared to 34% at the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters had voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, an elector of the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia for the change of the country's name that would open the door to NATO membership and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Paramento in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and fixing the chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to head high, not for the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said a "yes" would be the "confident of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the required influence.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote for it.
For the referendum to be valid, the influx must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the policy of the philo-Western government since its establishment in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal avoiding the full defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defense during the 2-0 match from Manchester City Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem extremely easy to mark his point at the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a half-field passage at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting on the free field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He humiliated a defender before overcoming several others at the limit of the Brighton area.
So he made a left pass, where he found Sterling.
The British attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat the Brighton Mathew Ryan doorman with a right shot in the network.
"Aguero is having problems on his feet," the city coach, Pep Guardiola, told the journalists.
"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he was able to sign at that time."
But it was Sterling that initially brought Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal has arrived at 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball in the net just before he left the camp.
The City will fight against Hoffenheim in the Champions League tour at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another beginning.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch Sundays against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which keep an advantage of a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies won at least one catch with a 5-2 win against the Nationals Friday evening, but still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play without goal, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
And why shouldn't I want to race?"
Nationals still have to announce a first launcher for Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer throw in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, performed a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher on his normal rest Sunday.
The launcher of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President made a direct reference to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the influx of republicans during the midterm elections.
"Everything we did is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really fighting for this for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "We see this horrible group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, you can see evil, evil.
They don't care who they can hit, who they have to take to get back power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, gave themselves the mission of "resisting and hindering."
"And it has been possible to see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "angry, bad, petty and liars."
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with democratic senator Diane Feinstein by name, triggering strong fiscis among the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did he trap the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uhm no, I look like a - that was a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Don't tolerate people who say what they think
When my local party Momentum activists voted to censor me, it wasn't a big surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of the Labour parliament to whom it has been reported not to be welcomed, and all because they have said what they thought.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan has received similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all arguments similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the local Labour Party parliament, the meetings of Friday evening were exactly like this.
However today this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and courteous" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on the basis that it is acceptable or not for party leadership.
All of this began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought of sharing a similar political vision began to expect an inversion by me and who took positions that I would never accept, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it does not really matter what I say - they follow involuntary insults on social media that demand my withdrawal, denouncing the policy of the centre and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues because the comments to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a stream of insults to sexist or racist background every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the selection rules, the party is restricted.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower the boss, not to express my views so openly and everything "would have gone well".
But it is not to do what I have become involved in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, caused by the uncertainty of the Thatcher government that had left my secondary school class literally falling apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as local councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way puzzled by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm the family nuclei, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy by talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those who I believe to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: A Ayr beaten the scale
Two late attempts could somehow have disbanded the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally funny game of Tennent's championship day.
I'm now at the top of the ranking, the only team hit ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their boldness, who pushed the house team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still beaten, so I must be happy," said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "It is necessary to recognize the merit of Ayr, they have better exploited the opportunities of us."
The target of Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow sign for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo has increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigor before, right in half time, to sign and then convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 at the interval.
But the Melrose started well the second time and the goal of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There has therefore been a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which has been spread, and at the start, the Ayr has been bounced back to the advantage thanks to a target of Stafford McDowall converted by Clima.
The replacement captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson then received a yellow sign and Melrose made the man pay more with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow sign for a contrast with Climo without ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson marked a touch down behind the Ayr advanced mix.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost since the reboot, after Rowe had collected football from David Armstrong's area and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth mile of the house team.
Still Game Star is looking for a new career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after finding out he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Actor 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in BBC's popular show, which writes and plays along with the long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final show and it seems that Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make statements, although a source of the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous catering trade."
'"The sea is ours": Bolivia without outlet on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path towards the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters covered with tailors in La Paz.
Public buildings exhibit a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours right.
Retrieve it is a duty."
In all Bolivia without outlet on the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in hand in Chile after a bloody conflict over the 19th century's resources is still alive, as well as the desire to release once again the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course is waiting for the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent dialogue, Chile will be obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an opening on the sea of State competence.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - has much to do with the judgment of Monday.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that little will change if it does.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate the territory of Chile and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the International Court of Justice arrived just six months after the final arrangements indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’ said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the last four years could have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has established any good intentions remaining in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep discussions as a result of what happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able to "take advantage of extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he explained.
Calzadilla has also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as political squamotting.
" Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea asserts that nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the USA
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation will never do nuclear weapons disarmament unless he can first trust Washington.
He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep faith in the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompey seems to be planning to restart diplomatic negotiations in stall after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an "illusion" that the continuation of the sanctions and the opposition of the US to an end-of-war declaration of Korea can never put North Korea on its knees.
Washington differs from issuing the statement without Pyongyang first performing important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and President USA Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is intent on giving up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompey is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows present the latest trend in huge covers that soon will be in a high fashion shop near you
If you want to extend your collection of covers or block the sun's rays completely, do not search further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed on the passersby a series of crazy overcrowding covers for their spring-summer 2019 collection that have impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have upset Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their captivating creations on the gateway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated hat of beige color decorated with a large edge similar to feathers that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included nailed anguries, a magic hat and even a pineapple - but were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have a sewing lip and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than high-cut.
One creation looked like a complete for diving with masks and eyeglasses, while another looked like a loose frozen cone.
And if you go on with the huge fashion statements, you're lucky.
The style observers predict that the huge beers could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats arrive on the trail of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide tessa more than one meter that has been seen on anyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label of worship behind the very impractical hat that has invaded the social media has sent another huge creation in the gateway: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the model in costume that wears it.
The burnt orange raffle bag, finished with raffia and with a white leather handle was the strong piece of the spring-summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big hats and beach bags will arrive in luxury shops next summer, because the designer has achieved such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results to the examinations, strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further higher education, career choice and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector able to develop and adopt a personalised school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular subject and demand within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language that understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to create trust relations with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the graduations, with the highest percentages of success within the independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages got the highest vote.
The data collected by the 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained the highest vote with Chinese praise, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the highest vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Languages, as a matter choice, are currently considered at the same level as STEM materials (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons why employees have shown the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
This is why language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of more languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, every school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by looking at 2020, such as Chinese Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with the specialized teaching staff in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills for success, regardless of their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative competences."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-sampling opening game on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still needs to be set for how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans were for the six pre-sampling games program of the Lakers.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly games to prepare myself," he said.
The time of gathering a West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the beginning of tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a rendezvous.
This is the first meeting of the five planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspended confirmation vote for his choice to cover the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the next midterm elections as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress at the November elections.
At what time will Trump's commission be and how can it be followed online?
Trump's committee in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow Trump's commission in West Virginia online through live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who have become tense because of the charges of sexual violence with an early confirmation vote of the suspended Senate for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get a little push.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign stated that these five meetings over the next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Deputies," according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so decisive for its programme that the President will travel in as many States as possible while we forward in the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's commission could call back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the media coverage of Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit the West Virginia, the state in which he had won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate at the Republican Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in line with the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, based on Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: USA team shows the courage to fight to keep hopes alive until Sundays
After three single-sensual sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The motion of the oscillating pendulum is a totally invented sport concept in which players firmly believe and never like in races like these.
So where's the bike now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so I'd say we're keeping a bit of a motorcycle," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four points ahead with other twelve at stake.
The Americans feel they have a little wind in favor, as Spieth said, and have a lot to hope for, not from the very last form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth has been spyed out from tea to green and is setting an example.
The partying gutting screams became stronger as the game continued, sinking a crucial putt to match the accounts to match the game four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt who made them win the game at the 15th hole was welcomed with a similar scream, which tells you that he thinks the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to put it all in your mind for your game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four by four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow from and to the quiet crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would not be a more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun falls on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European speeches of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon made it to Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was in a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two bogets on the first nine holes sunk Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they could not even go far.
But on Sunday there's no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and ants are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and that they do not give and the way the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage on the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage on Ryder Cup's final day after completing the four-ball and four-sabbath games with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score so far to Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to keep the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the fourballs of the morning, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has more resistance in the ants, winning two games, but they have not been able to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four queue points while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are the second couple to win four points from the four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After crashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a fallen Woods and the amazing American Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself for two games on Saturday, showed occasional sprawling of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven rows.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to the side of partner Henrik Stenson in the ants to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results expected in a pleasant and ventilated day in southwestern Paris.
The three times great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a gritty 2&1 win on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the forsome, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point gap passing to individuals, although as owner, Furyk's team only needs a match to defend the trophy.
After being the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of reach.
North Korea completely refuses unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions was unabated by the country's mistrust in the United States, which in such circumstances would have refused to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has adopted "significant measures of good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see any meaningful response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the USA there will be no security in our national security and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri has re-used the complaints concerning Washington's resistance to a "in stages" denuclearisation with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement has been important because it has not completely refused unilateral denuclearisation as it has already done in the past by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US President in office and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korean security.
North Korea sought a formal end-of-war agreement in the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States stated that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposed appeals to slow down the rigid international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The USA insists on the need to "have denuclearization first" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions in order to achieve their purpose in a coercive way and even oppose the "declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust."
Ri did not refer to programmes for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced to the UN at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the counterpart of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But even so, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly, when he stated that it was inevitable to target the US territory with the North Korean missiles after "the President of Evil" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" engaged in a suicide mission.
In front of the United Nations Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, he praised Kim for her courage in embarking on the disarmament path, but stated that much still needs to be done and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea's denuclearisation.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, stating that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for action.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompey said on Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "Respect of Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and certified denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported North Korea's control sanctions in 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompey met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and later declared that he would visit again Pyongyang the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He went back to Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea he had accused him of having submitted "demanded by gangsters."
North Korea had committed itself during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US had adopted "compliant measures."
He said that Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees to which Trump had committed himself to Singapore and actions towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has driven all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing virulent culture of studying for whole nights fed by caffeine.
A university student found that students at university number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he thinks is the first of this type in the USA.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that had given about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end a girl came to me and said to me, 'Why is this only now, when I'm last year?'
He said that no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to the students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The hour course provides for a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a bedroom, where students can select cups of coffee, tents, gymnastics shoes and books to be able to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," said Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the "night-to-night study", still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to a lack of sleep being a constantly growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, unwedness, anxiety, explained and even should help avoid fattening because lack of sleep brings the brain into unhungry mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course after following one of his lessons last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all graduates to follow a similar curriculum before joining this competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler advised students to set up a wake when they need to go to bed, as well as when they need to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can turn the circadian rhythm into tilt, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal cuts down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another attack of depression from outside the house with Dolly Menga's goal that relegated Steven Gerrard's destabilized team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team of Ibox was looking for the first home win from February 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team hit Gerrard's second defeat in 18 coach games leaving his team at eight points from the flight leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Rangers formation never seemed able to match.
As the Ranger now goes down to the sixth place, the Livingston goes up to the third, and only behind the Hibernian for difference in goals.
And there could be additional problems coming for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line was cured for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown off the outside house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly passed the Ayr in the semi-finals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that took a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated their opponents each time.
The Rangers may have dominated for ball possession but the Livingston has better exploited the balls at its disposal.
They could have signed just after two minutes when the filter passage of Menga in the first time sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's door but the center camper wasted the opportunity.
A deep punishment football from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow was able to only pull to the side on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the area of rigour.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he had to see a rigor at the end of the 15th after a fight with Steven Lawless, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice at the door in the first time but the former porter of the Ibrox Liam Kelly did not let himself worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's opening goal at the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it only for his commitment.
Once again the Rangers failed to manage a football placed deep in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact since the wing shoved a ball to Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw off the door line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly into the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long ball after the other.
Holt's team may have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor opposed stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton submitted a final request for rigour after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and the CONTEGGIO continues... the day the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by those credible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to identify radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earpieces you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Soon he's just breaking up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can therefore "see" a protein common to many types of tumors and are then re-injected
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovaries cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and therefore these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of tumors", including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for the extraction of immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to affect tumor cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself in a pro-Trump diarium wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after its appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was stabbed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live bet after a sconced performance during which he praised the President of the USA Donald Trump and said he would apply in 2020.
After playing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA hat, he started a riot against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to whites so many times and they say, "How you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which Hollywood's star took on the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Commission against allegations of sexual violence by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been transmitted, the recording of the West Philippine was loaded on social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to fool West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had had a bad time in the backstage because of his cover.
"They bullied me in the backstage.
I was told ‘don’t go out with that hat on.’
They bullied me!
And so they told me I'm an outcast," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I'd wear Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try love."
His comments generated whistles at least twice by the public and the members of the cast of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with a person who told the newspaper: "A mortal silence has fallen in the studio."
West had been invited as a substitute for the last minute of singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West has puzzled many with a performance of the I Love it song, disguised by Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the group of conservatives TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for TAKING THE MASSA."
But the show conductor Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "what it is and this is just wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (purchasing his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I think is embracing a vomity ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
This is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary music disappeared Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and therefore in the artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder for seizure at a Belfast restaurant

The Harington Sword Star Attacks Toxic Masculinity · Global Voices
Kit Harington is known for its role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Sword.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that these soles on screen often make the boys believe that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that "something went wrong" and reflected on how to handle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married with the co-star of Trono di Spade, 31 years old, admitted to worrying a lot about this problem.
'Personally I worry, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we're watching now?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic malehood due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, which makes kids think they have to be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the young.'
During the interview he also admitted that he will not interpret any prequel or sequel to the Throne of Sword once the series was completed next summer, stating that "he has finished with battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will play the main role in the revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the encounter with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with the Sword Throne.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose has interpreted Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in the fantasy series winning the Emmys.
The couple married in June 2018 in the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens affected by HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to sources of health authorities.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 units.
The transmission of HIV by sex is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the traditional values of the country, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual relations within these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff has intercepted the data of the PDO senators, and speaks of "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
The US deputy reported on Saturday the charges against a member of his staff regarding the publication of personal information of three US Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The democratic deputy of Los Angeles said that the statements were encouraged by opinionists and websites of the " ultra-right wing".
"Woman lies, lies and still despicable lies" said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The published information would include home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, issued by an anonymous Campidoglio during a hearing of an expert committee on sexual violence charges against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The news leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts has been associated with Waters' office and have issued information regarding a Waters staff member.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been put at risk as a result of these false and trendy accusations, has in no way been responsible for the escape of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is furious," wrote Fleischer.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he mustn't get angry.
It must not be provocative.
You must not question the reasons of the accuser.
You must remain calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by the detractors of looking too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to remove Waters in midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Enormous if confirmed," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office has warned "the competent authorities and the forces of order of these tending statements.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Review by Johnny English still hits - spy parody with a Rowan Atkinson undersized
It has become common now to seek references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
Will the veiled autoironia on the subject of how badly we are doing be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits has obtained his license to cash things for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that it is a comic creation developed for countries of non-anglophone cinema fruitors.
Of course it is the silly secret agent who despite his strange glamorous claims has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind who contributed with a single note to Gloria's theme of the opening ceremony of the Olympic games in London 2012.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man who once Atkinson played in the now forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, who left the chaos behind him.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English coming closer to the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and helices squeezing briefly against his elm.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that brands of "seri" films such as 007 and Mission It is now impossible to offer comic as an ingredient.
Humour seems directed to children rather than adults and to me Johnny English's crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as Atkinson's gags when he plays Mr Bean.
The premise of ever-changing news now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the British spy's supersecret web network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with the discomfort of the officer in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that causes the vessel to overflow for a presumptuous and stormy prime minister, who is already suffering a trace of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this similar-Teresa May character but there is not much to work on in the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that every active spy has been compromised and that he will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this means that poor Johnny English, who now works as school principal in a chic facility, but who also teaches in an official way about how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gag, when English offers a spying course like School of Rock.
English is defeated in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a girl's role in the high society where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of the disasters for the secret services of His Majesty are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously into the network of the charismatic billionaire of technology that claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the left Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, stacking fire in a French restaurant; unleashing hell by sneaking underground into the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to take dimesticity with the inside of the Volta house.
All scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as garbate and exuberant, there is a lot of TV for children throughout history.
Everything is quite modest.
And how did it happen with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry couldn't assign Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to be preparing a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, although they are paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer savings obtained with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
Thus employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with plans to shift the country towards workers.
The transition to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year it is expected to announce a review of the political line."
"It will not happen from day to day, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy for workers, as well as its industrial strategy as a whole."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week within the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy at the time of the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is not currently under discussion."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless leaders" and "speculators" in public services companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies might not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour Government could implement "deductions" on the basis of behaviors considered illegal.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees on business boards and to create funds with inclusive participation, so that 10 percent of the net assets of private sector enterprises are transferred to employees, which end up in the annual dividend pocket of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh might make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court of at least one week, and raised the doubt whether the findings of the government agency could influence or not any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview going on Sunday, the correspondent for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to bring something to light that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said it while I was going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, who came out that charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It has been resolved, determined, unequivocally."
Graham's vote, however, seems carved in the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you name couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new in change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the performance of a remarkable star trolley and has an equally respectable mission: ending poverty in the world.
Upon reaching the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people spilling over the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also a awareness of the real purpose of the event, that of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way that would help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But, exactly, how successful was the Global Citizen Festival now that there are 12 years left to achieve the intended goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to demand an action call, or is it just another example of the so-called "clicktiveism"- people who really feel the difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, used for a lot of different purposes.
He stated that these actions have helped to urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than 37 billion dollars, designed to influence, by 2030, the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In the early years of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, of which they have already been paid or used as funds at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the protected capital funds have so far had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom, committed to "helping children grow to the maximum of their potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ulman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions calling on the United Kingdom for better nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through interventions for nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and arduous journey - sometimes we frame and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of those who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement a "block" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington may, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States Ryan Zinke, as mentioned by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where he is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with you.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, implement a naval block, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the defendants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to make financial leverage and to replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "little versatile", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its natural liquid gases to Europe, and to replace Russia, an option which for European consumers is absolutely the most economical.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, try to persuade Germany to pull out of North Stream 2, draft "inappropriate" gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "prisoner" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that North Stream 2, which is spent from 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of the existing one up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economical project.
The Cremlin objectes that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, US Energy Secretary.
The US position has triggered the negative reaction of Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading organisation of Germany for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States to remain outside the EU's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a major problem the fact that a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "in serious consideration" of her candidacy at the Presidency in 2020, says Senator of the Massachusetts
Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren Saturday said she would take "serious consideration" of her chair following the mid-term election.
During a town assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could be a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and set up our evil government, and that means having a woman at the top," he said, according to what The Hill reports.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously the candidacy of my president."
During the Warren City Assembly he said about President Donald Trump, saying he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by him to the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: "It's natural that we need an FBI survey before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters themselves do not believe that they should apply in 2020.
58 percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not compete, according to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in support of a potential candidacy and 48 percent in contrast.
Other names of high-profile democrats discussed on a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden stated that he will make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"What's going on with my son, what's going on after he's back, I can put him in touch with other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries our soldiers are getting back with," he told the public at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they come a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic aggression and violence against a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of firearms under drugs, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and Columbia District Support the Challenge for New Asylum Policies
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a legal battle against a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and District of Columbia Friday presented a friendly curiae memory in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in appeal Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said that her partner "and her violent gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's been arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations that face explosive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed to submit a request for asylum to immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence.
Friday the District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be judged on the basis of specific events and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition violates that principle," states the memory amicus curiae.
Within the memory the prosecutors also objected that the policy banning the entry of immigrants is damaging the economy of the United States, affirming the clear probability that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labour".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to provide asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
" Asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion," Sessions declared on 11 June, in the context of the announcement of the political line.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people have to face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu while the budget of the dead doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became more and more desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her little baby feverish in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At all times there is an ambulance that brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, ruining among their friar personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were torn apart.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a shoulder fracture and back, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being cared for outside due to the continued severe shocks of siege.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted the sensation given by the violent earthquake that shook the room that he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed among the wall walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "prepotence" with "advertising propaganda"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement on a US daily, advertising the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
The United States last Wednesday President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, an accusation that China rejects.
The charges brought by Trump, regarding the fact that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections, noted what U.S. officials have referred to Reuters as a new phase of a Washington escalation campaign to pressure China.
While for foreign governments it is normal to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a trade war in escalation which has seen them adapt their duties to their imports.
China's reprisal duties at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, as stated by Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States to China and formerly a long-standing Governor of Iowa, a great exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion article in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now it increases those prepotentials by publishing advertising on our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Viceverse, in the street publishing house here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese population may have on China's economic trajectory, since the media are under the still fist of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China has eluded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not state what newspaper it was.
The Republicans are alienating the female electorate before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warns analysts
Since many leading Republicans defend the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are on his side in dealing with various allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have indicated that there will be a negative reaction, especially by women, during the future mid-term elections.
The turmoil in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
"You can't take these things back," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to placate angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow or November", said Friday, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn.
Friday morning the protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Chamber, when the Republicans that control the Judicial Commission chose to continue with the candidacy of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to the stars," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they were already tall; that's true.
But they could be higher, especially between the indecisive electrics of the periphery and the young voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not vote even though they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had assumed that a negative reaction might have occurred if the Republicans had continued with confirmation.
"For the GOP has become a confusing set," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, according to NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
"We don't only talk about voting for the committee, the final one, or if Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans managed the situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to whom they believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents have certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% say they have certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% stated that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, before the Senate's Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh assaulted him in a state of Jewry when he was 17.
Ramirez submits that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his genitalia during a party during his studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that derives its origins from Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," said the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "online personal data store" or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, musical libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data store online is that it is completely at the user's option who can have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal potencing through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology programmers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not tell "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely torn apart from day to day.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the ecclesiastic of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only ecclesiastical of the Church of England to be awarded with a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was commemorated in her hometown after 100 years.
The lieutenant colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, obtained recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a blind man and never knew he had obtained the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons opened a memorial plate.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnifically symbolic" the fact that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years ago by his grandfather's award-winning prowess.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion beyond the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog, under heavy fire of the camp and war machines".
Then he hurried to the line of fire and with the "largest gallantery" he advanced the line before he ran with a single hand cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German Czech on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never be taller and something that makes him more humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was truly honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed awake all night watching the famous Bellator 206 only and then you were denied the view of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 combats, including six on the main card, and had to be broadcast in the United Kingdom during the night, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were stuck when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some have remained grounded after staying awake until the first hour of the morning especially for combat.
On Twitter a fan described the transition to cartoon for children as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"The government regulation provides that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so you had to move on to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked for transmission.
"Peppa the pig," "yes."
"The president of the Bellator company, Scott Coker, said they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But there are six a.m. Sunday mornings and we will not be able to find a solution before Sundays of our time zone, Mondays for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came in and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we have tried to get so much for fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he's grown up feeling less than anyone due to his own sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24 year old said she didn't realize, until she got to secondary school, that "they're not all like me."
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs episode, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice hear about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that becoming a parent has made it less important for him to win the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old date program, Kirsty Young, took a series of free months for illness.
Introducing himself as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" anyone else while growing up because "he wasn't socially acceptable whether he liked boys or girls".
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, was the things that really gave me strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they had discovered his sexuality by chance.
The twice bronze medal at the Olympics became a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at the Commonwealth Games this year to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice heard because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three times world champion said that the fact that he had fallen in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013- "has caught me by surprise".
Daley married Oscar's winner, who is 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When he passed so much in his youth" - he went to his early Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced such heights and lows.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about the fact that 'I had to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be around here to be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I still didn't realize he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a house audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud of Heather Small - which had a particular meaning for him in preparing for the Olympics and still makes him the goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-form Miccelson put on a bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Miccelson will sign a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an inflatable billionaire stone.
Miccelson, playing in the biennial event for a 12th time as a record, was put on a bench by Captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between doing as a cheerleader and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what storms him.
Having never been the strongest of drivers even at the apex of his career, the 48th year is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the disconnected route regularly punishes the wrong hits.
And if the course itself was not discouraging enough, Miccelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the accurate champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the novel Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the beginning of their 12 single matches, start with a hot start, the Mickelson match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a package on my shoulder, put an arm around me and said he'll be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I had imagined more, but that's the way it went and that's the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Miccelson will pass Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even mirrored the heights of his personal record.
Miccelson has 18 winning games, 20 defeats and seven pairs, although Furyk said his presence has brought intangible goods to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to play people's games, and he's a great guy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also think younger players had fun cementing themselves against him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He's done a lot more than playing."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable retreat.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 meeting in Valderrama where the team, led by Seven Ballesteros, despite a five-point detachment from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimum advantage, winning 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"I continued to repeat that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but recently," Bjorn said (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5-3 and yesterday for 10-6 at Le Golf National.
"So it will be history to prove to me and my team that it is not over.
Tomorrow you have to give the most.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It didn't end until the points were marked in the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Bjorn added: "I would never have passed.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performance, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfer skills are tested hard.
This is the message you need to send to the players: tomorrow, you have to pull out the best of yourself.
Then forget about your partner because he also has to go there and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, the counterpart Jim Furyk will look for the best individual performance in its players rather than team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides at those big meetings of the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start immediately with the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medina.
When the game starts to take a certain fold, the pressure increases in intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way we feel appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of driving the counter-sensitive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
The new German military ship was postponed again
According to local media, the last fray of the German military Navy would have to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the times of the cold war, but there will not be until next year at least due to defective systems and a high cost.
The commission of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the Admiral ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit that mentions a military spokesperson.
The ship was supposed to join the military Navy in 2014, but worrying subsequent delivery issues tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the military Navy in 2007 will replace the old vessels of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markings.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use new cargoes up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continued delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its overseas power, will become obsolete when they enter into service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate fray Type F-125 made news last year, when the German military Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the ship yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the military Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media noticed a number of crucial "software and hardware" that made the ship useless if employed in a combat mission.
The deficiencies in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the oldest vessels in the Bremen class.
Moreover, it emerged that the ship weighs heavily too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the possibility of the military Navy to add future updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, 7,000 tons, is thought to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems involving the new sinks become of particular importance in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, parliamentary commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy actually "discharges ships able to be employed".
The official stated that the issue has worsened considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates were able to join the military Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal how bats use the view to get their food.
It is hoped that the discoveries can shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protective activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats, as well as the brown ears and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens, in Western Ross.
Special registrants will be placed in key places around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The analysis of the recorded sounds by an expert will determine the frequency of the bat calls and the manner in which each species behaves.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, an advisor for nature protection for the NTS, hopes that the results can reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to better maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Pipistles are at risk because of construction and development work that is of great interest and ruin habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as moschicid paper and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to grasping a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles to their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect truffles and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organization has even established the first reserve of Scotland for bats only at the estate of Thrave, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says that the property is the ideal territory.
"Here in Thrave we have a vast area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many secular trees and a good habitat.
But there is a lot about bats that we still don't know, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about their need for growth."
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before leading maintenance within the properties because it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal tripolo can kill up to 400 females and small, perhaps excrementing an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, disturb them or destroy their truces.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know as if their populations pass it."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labelled the charges of rape against him as "false news", stating that people "want to be advertised" by his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker at Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also reported on Friday the charge of payment of $375,000 to maintain silence on the incident.
In an Instagram video directed to its 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo broke the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five times Golden Ballone directed towards the camera.
"They want to be advertised through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the footballer smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the charges, called "an inadmissible report of suspects on the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent corresponding to the seriousness of the violation of privacy, probably considered one of the most serious of the personal rights of recent years".
The event would take place in June 2009 in a suite at the Las Vegas Palms Casino Resort.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would return to the footballer's room, where he underwent anal violence, as reported in the statements filed at the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayora claims that Ronaldo would get on his knees after the incident saying that he was a "99 percent" "good boy" disappointed by "one percent".
From the documents it turns out that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual relationship, but that this was consensual.
Majorga also states that she went to the police and to the hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement because she felt "terrorized by the twists" and worried about the prospect of "coming humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old is now trying to overturn the agreement, claiming to be still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to pass to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer will join the Italian Juventus with a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom "could regret forever" the loss of its status as a world leader in the construction of cars following Brexit," said the Minister of Industry Greg Clark.
He also added that he was "concerned" for the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC on the possible exit of Britain from the EU without an agreement and the consequent momentary block of production in the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese car company claims that delays at borders, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston factory, in which Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain will leave the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Increases concern in other UK motor vehicle manufacturers for EU exit without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit will close its Mini facilities in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain found by manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is managed on the basis of the "just in time" concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from English and European suppliers for ordering cars.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom will leave the EU without an agreement, there could be some problems at borders that would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of inventory value in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "considered precisely to avoid these inconveniences at borders".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, over the long term, warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates of the plant, says that the workers are strongly concerned: "According to my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reinstated."
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "reminded for a week", while the dispute continues on Judge Brett Kavanaugh, declared the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference to the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's advisors, and the possible obstacle to justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Over the course of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and shouted that he was going to quit.
Instead, he was announced on Wednesday a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a overlap with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of instructions from the FBI against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "It has not been established a date, it could be this week, I imagine you will be sending yourself back another week considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists might dispute this: Sanders has not had a briefing with the press at the White House since 10 September.
Driver Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of briefing is not due to an aversion for television journalists "who show up", although he said: "I do not disagree with the fact that they show up".
So it made him think that direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
"The president holds more sessions of Questions and answers from any president before him," he said, adding without quoting the evidence: "We have checked the figures".
The briefings will still be there, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
Let's try to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown the reason, making a free-wheel speech, and at the same time bizarre, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to European workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to dealing with the costs of the requests for a selective status (a permanent resident person status) for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "There have been continued negotiations throughout the summer between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of a scenario without agreement.
I know this is a time of great concern to all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and not only, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, giving benefits to patients and communities to whom we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly desire you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was operated urgently following a head injury
The Tennessee defender State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after bringing a head wound to the Saturday game against the Vanderbilt Commodoros in which the team lost for 31-27, as Mike Organ of The Tennessee newspaper reported.
Technical Officer Rod Reed told journalists that the accident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the period.
"He approached the camp and passed away," Reed said.
First aid personnel and medical personnel administered oxygen Abercrombie on board the camp before placing it in the barrel and taking it away for further checks.
A Tennessee State leader reported to Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no news about the type and extent of damage" and that Tennessee States are trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, student in the second year, is at her first season with Tennessee States after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five plaques before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 plaques.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes for buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless according to new workers' plans
Manoeuvre will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the tax on bubbles will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Treasury plans to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bubble taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, will announce today Theresa May.
Manoeuvre will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing accommodation at a higher price and higher income.
The increase in bubble tax will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be in support of the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homeless people.
The overcrowding, which is added to the current bubble tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the property buy to lets (purchase to be rented), could constitute more than 3%.
The Ministry of Treasury expects that the manoeuvre can collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
An estimated 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers of a first house to enter the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson had demanded a cut on bubble tax to help younger people with the purchase of the first house.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking over land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up housing shares at affordable prices to fix the British "real estate disgrace".
Mr Corbyn has announced an exciting series of proposals for reform of the housing market, including the checks on rents and the elimination of unscathed evictions.
He also wants to give the council greater powers on building new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said that I would be committed to re-establishing the British dream, which is that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as is the case for British workers who do not live in the United Kingdom.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become too distant and the dignity of homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to drive Scotland"
The Technical Director of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum aspiration" is to become Scotland's manager first or later.
The 42-year-old Scottish is attracted to the challenge of getting the North-East team to stand third in the League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after being at the guide of St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I've been in B series and that's all," Ross said to the Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager."
Ross's predecessors to the Sunderland leadership were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician claims that he does not feel any anxiety in following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I get the team back."
The start of Ross's career as a manager was three years ago, after a period as a coach assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa save himself from the downside to the third level and brought the St. Mirren from the edge of the downside to the title of champions of the Championship, the next season.
Ross claims to feel much more at ease now than during his football career in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical teams.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
"I really thought the role of manager was done for me, more than the role of player.
It seems strange because I worked well, made a living, and had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure from work but management seems good.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel much more calm than I've ever been in my life."

According to one study, the right time for a painting is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer hot wave has led to greater incash to the English pubs in difficulty and more concern to the catering services.
The data show that pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July, while the inflows of restaurants have fallen by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consulting company, put the data together and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England to the Worlds has caused the month of July to follow a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were over 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit harder.
The collapse of 1.8 percent in the restaurant in June has worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which you drink mostly turned out to be the most solid, with a homogeneous increase greater than the drop in restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not excessively like the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go outside for a drink.
In the pubs and in the managed bars the sales of the drinks are upwards of 6.6 percent in the month, while the consumption of the food has fallen of three percent".
Paul Newman, an analyst in the RSM recreational and receptive sector, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent a year will be particularly serious in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come in a worse time for the restaurants and only time can tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce."
The overall growth in sales between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the roll-out of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring company for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK brings together and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the industry's reference company.
One out of five children has secret accounts of social networks that hide parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some only 11 years old, owns secret social networks accounts that hide parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 senior middle school students revealed an increase in Facebook pages on Instagram.
The news has reinforced the fear that contents are posted to sexual background
20% of students said they had a "principal" account to show to their parents
One child in five, some only 11 years old, creates accounts of the social networks that keeps adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 senior middle school students revealed a rapid growth of "Fake on Instagram" accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has reinforced the fear that content is posted on a sexual background.
Twenty percent of the students said they managed a clean "principal" account to show their parents, while maintaining a private account.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who urged others to "stuff me".
Research, the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of private schools, has shown that 40% of boys between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted by creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council at the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in light athletics and President Ian Beattie has described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who manage sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience in the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a deep respect among the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are sure that in Scotland athletics could gain a huge advantage by bringing it into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I can't wait to act as an athlete's voice and I hope to be able to contribute and help drive sport in Scotland."
The American, 200 and 400 meters winner of the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently BBC opinionist, found herself unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell if I'd recover and to what extent.
It was an exciting job but I took it all back, learned it again to walk and today I move with agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!".
The advertising of a tidalate compares mothers and cows and divides the opinion online
A company producing a tidalact has divided the opinion on the net with an advertising that compares the nursing mothers and the mountain cows.
To mark the launch of what is defined as the "first silent and wearable tidalact in the world", the society of consumer technology Elvie launched an advertisement in the form of funny music videos to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new tiralact.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a trail that includes songs like, "Yes, I'm taking my milk but I don't have one" and "If I hadn't noticed it, these aren't breasts but my tits."
The choir continues: "Throw him out, throw him out, feed the children, throw him out, throw him out, throw his milk to my lords."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook pages, caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video triggered different reactions among the viewers, many of whom claimed that it highlighted the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to stay pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their little ones are stolen from it a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie tiralate wears herself discreetly under a bra for mothers
Someone else commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a mother-to-mother stripper who will continue to hold their children?"
Someone else added: "It's really meaningless advertising."
Others defended her and one woman even admitted to finding the song "funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd like to have one.
When I used tiralet, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little irreverent, but it doesn't get far from reality.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a fun advertisement dedicated to mothers who use tidalact (often on the job or in the bathroom) and feel like "ducks."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the home industry."
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet tidalact lined up in the bra.
The concept that the campaign is inspired by is based on the idea that many women who use tidalact feel like cows.
The Elvie tiralate is however completely silent, has no threads or tubes and can be stuck in a nursing bra giving women the freedom to move, keep the children in their arms and even come out while they milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD commented: "Elvie's tiralatte is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use lattice to cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tilat is able to ensure."
This is not the first time Elvie has made news.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children showed up on the walkway of the designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a tendopolis at the borders of Texas
The number of migrant children increased exponentially even though the monthly crossings of the borders remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and the political line of Trump administration made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who took them in trust were usually illegal immigrants who are now afraid to jeopardise the possibility of staying in the country by offering to do such a gesture.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the potential trustees and other adult members of their families would be taken fingerprints and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in front of Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to rely on children alone.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the people who offer to rely on children or belong to the families of these people are illegally in the country and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people," Albence said.
In order to try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules so that some of them will have to appear in court within one month of the stop, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to who works at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconferencing rather than in person, to perpetrate their cause of legal status in an immigration court.
Those who will be considered unfit to receive help will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children remain in confidence, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or escape attempts, according to those who work at reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the likelihood of this happening is even higher in a large structure such as Tornillo where, due to its size, it is easier for children's discomfort signals to be ignored.
They add that the movement of children in the tendopolis without giving them time to prepare emotionally or greet friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria intimates US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war had arrived at the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces occupy the Syrian soil illegally with the pretext of combating terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without setting any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 dead and millions of people had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and support the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the field in this war-torn country.
On the problem of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favorable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "unfounded fears" which encourage refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should be only a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be allocated in Syria until a political agreement will be reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of an Idlib bearing zone, the last important fortress of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extended attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will target the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene a new committee of government and opposition members to extend a draft constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee by stating that the group's work must be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will be awarded the second term
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators might hope, his presidency should not come to an early conclusion due to impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidency final ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of the viewer's bending.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first evening have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million spectators in the first evening, significantly increasing compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program exceeded the network's percentages by reaching 3.5 million spectators in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's not something to explain," says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC's TV series "Designated Survival" that tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi race in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Why do you make me laugh?"
So chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television programme, the outline of Washington's events can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade ruling, whether immigrant families can meet or not and the health status of the global economy.
To stop following the news is, however, a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes well beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather jacket ("an outfit full of tracottance" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for example, won't be able to look Super Mario anymore without thinking about it.
"Part of why what he does seems to be a reality show is in the fact that every night there is news," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the approach of actors and daily developments of Trump's show plot (in contrast to N.F.L. who praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise you stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a day of sunshine with almost 30 degrees, it was closed at home to watch the MSNBC and while recording the CNN.
He failed to get off the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate's judicial committee and before the future uncertainty of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we once did all those absurd programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

External cash flow in the race for the most secure half-term elections
It is no surprise that in the 17th district there is a flow of money due to the re-alignment of a congress district which has made two members currently in office running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of the Pittsburg suburb brings democratic representative Conor Lamb into play, who conquered his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in charge, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that in the old districts electoral colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of republicans.
The race to the 17th district sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a measurement victory in the special elections of March for the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania.
That place had been occupied by a republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the 20-point district.
Political opinionists have given the democrats a slight advantage.
The United States has thought of penalizing El Salvador because it supports China, then they have changed their mind
Diplomatics have observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 there was a rather friendly meeting between Panama President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization's leading group to leave.
The officials of the State Department decided to bring the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama following the "new decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", said the spokesperson of the Heather Nauert department in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was taken only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately $140 million in aid from the Americans for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been of concern to the country of Central America with a high percentage of unemployed and homicide.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America referred to a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thus definitely giving up any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was assigned to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, demonstrating the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, the diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further messages of reproach or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson from Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously about internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who still wanted to maintain anonymity.
Study history
In the report to be published, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which now seems to have enough evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress passes to democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations before the electors and perhaps to a jury of his own while preparing for a new candidacy.
The unknowns are many and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is not that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the struggle may last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
On that occasion we failed by letting ourselves escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans must face different ones at the moment.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire the deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested submitting Trump to intercepts by questioning his ability to cover up the role of president.
Rosenstein claims that the news coming out on The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete or impartial or if it will be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the reliable accusations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, in the mid-term elections we will vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare itself for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we will.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with the Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing match against the Villarreal in Spain, would give them great opportunity to qualify for the G Group of Europe League.
Although due to an accident on his knees, the midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season on the occasion of the 2-2 match with the Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because the Villarreal is a good team," said the 30-year-old player.
"We faced the game convinced of doing good and we brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis, but, above all, parity is a just result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better us.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points, but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last match, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not fail.
Last year has certainly been difficult because of my accidents and changes at the club level itself but now the sensations are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation is doing well.
We can therefore forget the problems of last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term assistance
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of care they would like to receive, few have dealt with the topic in the family.
About half of Nationwide's interviewees say they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% say they've talked to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance sector, "people want to be a member of their family to take care of them, but don't face this conversation."
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare your family to assist you if you don't communicate for a while what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be crucial to costs.
Involve a financial consultant: you will be able to advise you how to pay the expenses you will have to face.
The choice of funding for long-term assistance may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid policy on life with ransom value to cover these expenses or to continue to pay money for insurance until you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles to your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also evaluate the possibility of a prosecutor for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so.
Don't forget the details: imagine that your parenting elder will be brought urgently to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a matter of finance, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."
Male hit several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with a compressed air gun while falling back on foot after spending the night outside.
The victim, a fortnight, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "causual action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
He's not in any danger of life and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died following a severe earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The victim's budget is destined to rise.
Communications are interrupted and rescue managers have failed to obtain any information from the Domanga regency, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data about Palu and Dongaga on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When she was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongaga is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and above all the coastal region of Domanga.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dojaga were hit several times by tsunami in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongaga.
Another tsunami hit the western Domanga area in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area called Pacific fire belt and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a huge earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing, along the Indian Ocean coast, 226,000 people, of which more than half Aceh.
2005: a series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that escalated against the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 fell near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake struck the kingdom of Pidie Jaya in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who recalled the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
In this case there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested with the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin, Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspect domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting the arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her by the hand.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility center and his security was set at $500, based on what was reported by KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin is likely to be charged with three first-degree crimes, namely detention up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also admitted to a second-detainable crime with a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under consideration by the court Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, of obstructing the complaint of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 for connecting the violent behavior of the child to post-traumatic stress syndrome resulting from the period spent in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity network and the communications network are not functioning and the victim's budget is destined to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit off Sulawesi Centrale, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media they circulate videos that show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami fell on the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors call for extraordinary capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks at NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, author of the terrorist attack that has caused the death of eight people: a rare sentence that has never been committed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a Home Depot rental truck to lead on a cycle track along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
On the basis of the conditions for requesting capital punishment in the southern New York district, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed eight victims and similarly "intendedly" inflicted serious bodily injuries.
According to the court document, both of these charges may lead to the death sentence.
Week after the attack, a great federal jury charged Saipov 22 counts of charges involving eight homicide charges with an association of offenders, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "an actual planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said by describing the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, offenses and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the southern New York district pursued the last case of capital punishment.
The man cited in court, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was finally sentenced to jail in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and incriminating for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's spouses both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police say that in front of the investigators they said they were proud of what they did.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang up the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As regards the 22 counts, he declared himself not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was called "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to call for the death penalty rather than accept recognition of guilt and condemnation to the jailhouse without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense group had previously prayed the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory states that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today swore to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the Members of Parliament of the Theresa May Party suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former Leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone told Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already be out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May has to face in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party have been underlined by the Torys in favour of staying in Europe who have participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
Allies insist on continuing their attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and to force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between what May proposes and the "caos".
At the meeting of the Leave Means Leave organization held in Solihull, Bone said she wanted to leave the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"At this time we would be out of Europe," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan."
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servants.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the views that public opinion would be changed by the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false."
Also MP Tory Andrea Jenkyns, supporter of Brexit, took part in the procession and told journalists: "I simply tell the Prime Minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public opinion in general, the opposition will not vote on it and will not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who drive through the streets by casting votes to allow us to be elected.
Forget the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
At the committee, Farage stated that politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they were going to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message for the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to feel the pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched on the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour commission in the center of the city.
A small number of activists pushed the Torys against Brexit flags after group formation this weekend.
The worker laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they had with an app of the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for boundless friction and for unlimited trade in Ireland," he added.
It's all a farce.
A good Brexit does not exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections she will think seriously if she can run for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the democratic senator of the Massachusetts Saturday spoke about her future during a town assembly in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often criticising President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that Trump could challenge in 2020 was already in the air.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled down.
One participant asked if you would like to apply for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to fix the government and this implies that a woman covers the highest charge."

Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the win on Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team's orders
When on Saturday Valteri Bottas qualified in front of comrade Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately obvious that the orders of the Mercedes team would have heavily conditioned the race.
From the pole, Bottas goes well by leaving Hamilton to defend himself against Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel first stops at the boxes leaving Hamilton in the traffic of the group tail, which could be decisive.
Mercedes makes the next stop by going back to the track behind Vettel. Hamilton however overcomes it after some wheel-to-wheel actions where Ferrari's driver tries to prevent its passage inside, risking to end up outside after a double shift to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
So drive the race for most of the race without stopping to box for the rubber change and tries to quickly finish to overcome Kimi Raikkonen conquering fourth place.
In the end, however, you must make the pit stop at the 44th round and in the remaining 8 laps you are not able to increase the step and exceed Raikkonen, who arrives fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri worked very well all weekend and was really nice to have me spend.
The team has done exceptional work to win the first and second position," Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
On a committee held on Saturday, President Donald Trump questioned Senator Diane Feinstein for her insistence on not revealing the content of Christine Blasey Ford's letter that accused of attempted rape the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a commission in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "meschines, bad and liars".
"What can happen and what is happening in recent days in the Senate where people are angry, petty, bad and liars," he said.
"When there are clear signs that the news is being disseminated and those responsible say "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn't," she added imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was disclosed at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion is blocked by her office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, but I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did it."
But his lie is not credible for the president, who during Saturday night's party commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of attempted sexual offense by three women, the president suggested that democrats are using these accusations for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see pettyness, evilness. They don't care who harms, who has to pass over to regain power and control," said the president as reported by Mediaite.

Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he died to allow a plane that carried hundreds of people to take off and save them.
More than 800 people died and many were scattered because of a huge earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong siege shocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped among the mackerel in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grandma remained in his place in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport of Palu, which was flung fearfully.
He wanted to make sure Batik Air 6321, which was on the track, was able to take off safely.
So he threw himself out of the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirit, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's a very sad news for us," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach the thousands and the national disaster counter agency indicates that access to the cities of Dongaga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The count of the dead is destined to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and it was impossible to reach many others," explains the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be done on Sunday.
Military and commercial speeds are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the people of the country's army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that there is a dispersal after the lagoon crash
The airline that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after stating that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had been able to save themselves, now claims that there is a dispersal.
According to news from Air Niugini, updated Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, e.g. age or nationality.
The local boats saved the other passengers and the crew after the accident while the aircraft was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline claims that six passengers have been accommodated at the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable conditions.
What has caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane is rushed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane has reached a very low altitude.
"Ed was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the plane's emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants were panicked and shouted and that he was slightly hit in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to fix a bridge provided help by using a rubber to carry people on the shore before the plane collapsed in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in aircraft accidents of the airlines registered with PNG but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the burned woman alive
On Saturday, the presentation of the prosecution's evidence in the new trial against a man accused of having burned a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used his cell phone data to rebuild the 19th-century movements accused Quinton Tellis and the 19th-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed that he recovered the localization data from several mobile phones that demonstrate that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford showed up in court on Saturday and testified that day was not in town.
When the public ministry asked him whether Tellis was telling the truth saying that that night was in the Sanford truck, the latter confirmed that he was "misleading because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Phone data indicate instead that they have only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers died, Tellis deleted from his phone Chambers' messages, calls and contact information.
"He erased it from his life," said Hale.
The defense will begin its concluding argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the judgment to pass to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is hip-hop conscious?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting positive messages into its songs.
The group The High Breed, in Bristol, claims that hip-hop has turned away from its origins when it broadcasts political messages and denounces social problems.
Instead they want to go back to their origins and make a kind of conscious hip-hop again.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York pope cites a couple in court for having fired her with a "racist" text
In New York, a papa cited a couple in court for discriminating her in a discriminatory way after she received by mistake a text in which her mother complained that she was "another black."
The couple refuses to be racist by comparing the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his disappointment when he discovered that the new Tata, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the error, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "marriaged" fired Miss Maurice saying that she had not been happy with their previous African-American papa, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Miss Maurice his work day and sent him home with a taxi.
Maurice mentioned the couple in court and, to be dismissed, asked for a compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she had initially been hired, even if without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said on Friday to the Post adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusation of racism saying that the dismissal of Mauritius was the only thing to do because they feared that they could not trust her after she offended her.
"My wife sent her a message in which she said something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"You would entrust your children to a person you were escorted with, even if by mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that his wife has been giving birth for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't deal with a person in this way.
It is not a very kind behaviour," added the financial consultant.
While the legal case is still under way, the public opinion court has been sued by spouses on social media criticizing them harshly for their behaviour and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that the publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's not easy to put herself in the cloths of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success achieved by Paddington."
Affirming that the father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the refusal of his work, adds that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was quite a quiet man, not a presumptuous person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when he has a son who reaches a goal: you are proud even if it is not your credit.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success this way.
Even though it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say good-bye to my daughter's phone that was dying.
At the landing the daughter was moved urgently to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't have done it," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then she called me to tell me she'd be dead in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly becoming confident.
She died a while ago and it was the end.
I had to sit down and wait knowing this was going on.
I couldn't complain, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to take care of myself."
At last Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with other passengers who were unaware of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he says.
"For all the time I've done nothing but cry low-headed.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Tickets from two grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed themselves to suicide are committed to preventing others from performing the same gesture.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked a bridge in Wales with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said that he lit every room he walked into."
But before he died he left work because depression had brought him "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can address to talk to, even if it's a friend.
They must not isolate themselves, they must speak."
Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"You never said you felt down or depressed," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
The Christmas Day touched the bottom. When the children opened the presents, it avoided looking them in the eyes."
He says that his death was a huge trauma that they had to develop: "He has torn the family.
He broke us up.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI has started the investigations
"I think that if we could proceed as he asked, that is, with a limited investigation in time and within, we could reach an agreement," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "losing calm" because of the blockade of the root supporters.
Why does Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
Only five weeks to the mid-term elections on 6 November. If Republicans as expected will get a negative result, they will be strongly weakened in their attempt to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators by urging them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him he met Ashley's wife, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
We shall vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 republicans and 49 democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the delay and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea's political refugees "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean legislator claims that the number of North Koreans asking for political refuge in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean unification ministry, states that refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the highest rates asked by those who illegally release these people.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
To the vast majority of refugees in North Korea at the end, South Korean citizenship is offered.
According to Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal migrants rather than refugees and often returns them with force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearisation negotiations which are in a state of stagnation.
This after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general to collaborate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized US sanctions for the lack of development since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security and in such circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament at first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and claims that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the Nancy Pelosi minority defines the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and states that he is not particularly suitable for this task.
Pelosi expressed this opinion Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had behaved in the same way, they would have called it hysterical," Pelosi said about the statement made on Thursday by Kavanaugh before the Senate's judicial committee.
Visually excited Kavanaugh denied the charge of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the midst of emotion, so close to screaming and with the throat narrow from the crying while talking about his family and years at the upper school.
He has also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the committee who have defined the charges against him as an "absolute and coordinated defamatory campaign" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi believes that the testimony of Kavanaugh proves that it cannot enter the Supreme Court because it has proved to be prevented against the democrats.
"I think he was self-exclusive with his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh in a state of charge if it was confirmed and whether the democrats should reach the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think that if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only not suitable for the Supreme Court, but not even for the court that you're presiding now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the District Circuit of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh dismissed the questions about his intention to overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said that "You cannot send a hysterical person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be accepted in a positive way".
And women have to use it.
It's a fair diarrhea, months and years of angry attacks from which he can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, and you?"
And she went on, "She helped me a woman who was leading somewhere. She told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique so when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it kept going.
I thought yours was a brilliant idea."
Tears are tolerated as the exorcism of anger in part because they are fundamentally not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office dates back to when I once cried for an access to anger. A woman older than me, an ice manager from whom I had always been slightly frightened took me for the neck and dragged me along the stairs.
"Don't ever show yourself crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy because they have you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, when on a boat called Monkey Business was discovered Hart's extra-conjugal relationship that had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not have tried herself to run for the presidency.
"It wasn't really a well thought-out decision," he said to me about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and no longer needed another one.
Someone called them "Biancane and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late in fundraising and swore that she would not run unless she had raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause at the start.
He found that some of the supporters who had given the candidates $1,000 men to her would only give 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" she asked.
When he held his speech to announce that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported him, disappointment towards the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination he was victim of), which he committed.
"He seemed to be preying on a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled thinking about the reaction of the press.
"Someone could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my stone.
Maybe "Pray a lot."
How the US-China Trade War Could Promote Beijing · Global Voices
The attacks on the opening of the trade war between the USA and China were fraudulent and, while the battle is yet to be concluded, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with the new duties on articles for over $200 billion (EUR 175 billion) of value, which means that half of Chinese goods will be charged.
Beijing has reacted every time with similar measures by applying duties from five to ten percent of 60 billion US dollars of goods.
China has promised to respond to the USA's coup and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon go back.
Because Washington resigns, it would have to give in to its demands, but publicly bending to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the USA can positively influence China over the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who studies Asia at the Center for New American Security research center.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supports the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by over seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have abandoned the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million who still live in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any conditional or conditional aid from those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the Ryder Cup 2018 beating the US team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National out of Paris, France.
The US has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points that were needed to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Miccelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his shot tea in the water at the 16th hole of par 3 granting the win to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his shifts becoming one of the four players always to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first contested in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the Thorbjorn Olesen rankings of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has retired for 2&1 to English Ian Poulter who might have disputed his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight of them, became the European player who won more in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry but today I can't help it.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's a team victory and I'm glad I made my contribution," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the witness to his national John Ram who beat the legend of the USA Tiger Woods golf with the score of 2&1 on Sunday singulars.
"If I think I grew up watching his meetings, I'm really proud to have fought Tiger Woods," said twenty-three-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four his matches in France and now the count of his meetings in the Ryder Cup is 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 pairs.
A strange statistic if you think it's one of the biggest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team sought all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europe team.
We threw away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players behaved very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We put it all together.
But they played better than us."
