A republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers only identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments promulgated new laws from 2009 that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon expanded following the November 2010 elections, which included 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in the year 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo identity card and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to vote as an elector on the day of the vote and withdraw citizens with a legal record their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The republican authorities have endeavoured to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required identity card with pictures.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with pictures issued by their institutions.
On the other hand, these same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
However, it turns out that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on election day in eight States.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, at the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to record approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the enrolment rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the voting period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the voters in the state.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, the whites who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make exercising the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on and see a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that States that have adopted these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to affirm with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Testing prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present incorrect results, with false negative results or false positive results, resulting in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes the men already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In U.S. studies, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it was difficult to interpret these data and have strong recommendations.
Another study, the European study, concluded a difference in mortality between patients who had been tested and those who had not.
This study has also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more chances of metastases if not detected.
So I recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are painless.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by opting, in such cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, precise criteria are determined to determine who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend that you pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not you should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to assess the per and against the APS test.

Preventing illness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would climb to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is associated with 85% of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a lot of damage to people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says the spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
Weight
Embonds and obesity also promote the occurrence of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, oesophageal, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," he added.
Food
The organization also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much, it raises the risk of being diagnosed with colorectal cancer.
Carcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can harm the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he said.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive for the moment.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and family background with his doctor.
"To pass a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
Higgs boson decorated
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole enamel last summer, and for cause.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, nothing but that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "lesser" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet entirely certain that it is the Higgs.
We know without any doubt that we hold a genuine new particle, and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a large physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain of it.
Let's just assume that this is the Higgs, because the chances of being deceived seem thin, and let's see what this is about.
In this low world, there is a fatally inevitable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
Although the physics of particles is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: the principle of Pauli exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consists largely in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles in two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens named farmers, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other one they are boins, a foul band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These boons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the boson of Higgs would in some way be related.
These boons, we must emphasize here, not all of them as exotic as we might believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, this "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, a little like a nail thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" there is an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the boons "force carriers".
Field more stable
The same goes for the Higgs boson, this difference close to it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to excite it, it must reach very, very high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could laugh the surface.
That is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring of circumference! - to achieve such energies.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Not all particles, nor all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold himself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do it have a mass, while the others (such as photon, yours) do not have it.
Now, what can all these research be done, does Mrs Plamondon ask?
For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to examine any gap between observations and predictions of MS.
In addition, there are many people who would like to find it, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "physical new" and close some holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, not proposing any explanation for the gravity (ops!) or the dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ops!).
But no such deviations have been found at CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of these research on the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. All-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such thing.
Keep in mind: at the beginning of the 1960 ’ s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already been told fire by physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, initially the laser was rather seen as a "Labo gadget".
Imagine...
And then applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical work.
This sensor, although it was not his original intention at all, now serves as a "eye" for all the digital cameras in the world, and has earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.
Of course it doesn't mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die...
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed shortly as a bill is being prepared.
In this essential area, however, much remains to be done.
Duty tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was kidneying had left him a two-year respite.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half-daughter, lying in his bed at the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where he arrived on the eve.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents her from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Stuck in front of an appetizing breakfast, he agrees to let himself help eat, resigned.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers around him, brings him his medication, offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for me to be cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this.
"During our life, we learn that a man, it pisses up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's house.
Returning to the child's stage, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
It depends on the ability of the person to accept the regression, he observes.
For, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments occur at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a life forecast of up to three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them is no longer providing care called curatives.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die " conscious and choked " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't have any more desires in life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for her son from Italy to visit in the coming days.
In Victor-Gadbois, we provide, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
It's palliative care, which we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home doctors.
Whether it is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At the time of death, oral care will be provided to the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar rate.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer at Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At Victor-Gadbois' house, the days follow, but they don't look like each other.
Along with a 93-year-old man who enjoyed his last family assembly in the courtyard, well-skinned in his pillows while he was torn in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the final phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great shortage in Quebec health care that causes several palliative care doctors to fear the adoption of a law that involves euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed of peak palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing the necessary thing to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients don't want to die because they don't get the right care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are fond of their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helene Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she gave up a very strong chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told me.
Yet she told me I was done!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask to die thank the caregivers for not having come to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often use palliative sedation, which goes back to sleep until the patient dies, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of suffering.
More and more, the unsolved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanase me," which means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a Journalism Fellowship of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and experts from the Italian Mafia relate day after day what they know of a formidable "system", mixing the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A " industry " that cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has broken down since we took the big shots," ironic Jacques Duchesneau, a member of Parliament in Quebec and a former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, by means of a substantive investigation into the wrongs associated with the road work contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had consented only to retreats.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden party funding and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, did he stress that the only transportation department would have saved $1 billion on the contracts," some saying their instincts to reach a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he added, hoping that it will "show up the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also competes with its army of auditors, investigators and government analysts.
Plus the police of "the Marteau Squad" who, since 2009, would have led Montreal's "outboard card" to put the sweet pedal on the swellings of contracts...
Over the past few weeks, she has been conducting a series of searches and charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that it has poisoned repeat wine pots in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers on the outskirts of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambim.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid over the years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the Mafia who was returning the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambim sowed in all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially Liberals then in power.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal collection of funds for the former Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Exhaust contracts inflated costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked round.
Gilles Surprising, former public works engineer, detailed it in front of the commission: in ten years, he received gifts construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and winepots totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs were inflated.
Other road officials have confessed to fattening the leg by inflating bills from 30% to 40% by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early in November, plunged Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rolleau was one of Montreal's first elected to draw the alarm bell.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, she rose from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and resale... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "put on a thread to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the faults".
The process, she says, is "sorry but positive".
We are cleaning up the wound, but it would take a unit of inquiry proper to Montreal and one day, not to see doubting practices come back.
Just like we do the housekeeping.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes from his side that "public servants have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elevation in the knowledge of the stratageme", when they did not spring into the maguille!
Estimate to 70% the share of dirty money in funding electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to $100 to parties, but this will not change the donation, according to it: "Unless we limit electoral expenditures strictly, there will be dirty money in politics."
He calls for a comprehensive review of the system of public contracts and party funding: "We cannot go any further; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story obscures the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it in their own courtyard...
"The PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you took a new size with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I progress next to them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements lead me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
It's all going very fast in the football.
But I'm not on fire.
From my beginnings to the Clairefontaine INF pre-formation centre to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced through stages.
So you benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to fighting very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face up to and provide as much as possible.
Also, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He was shouldered by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with hupped clubs.
He joined great players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I was out of a series of injuries.
His confidence in me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at on the first part of the PSG season?
In League 1, Lyon took our place as leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
First we want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a great European club in the short term?
He's already got the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in time.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the GSP provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really have the heart to spoil this title of champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the skills to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseilles, Lyons or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have weapons to take.
Do you think the media is waiting too long for the GSP?
It's normal that we expect a lot of ourselves in the light of what was invested and the players we've got.
We totally accept it.
Then, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame us, it's sure to be a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the League champions that we could answer.
Look at Manchester City that hasn't been qualified for the 8th finals since two seasons, they've also made huge expenses!
In view of the money invested, you were imagined with 15 points in advance at the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have the smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up taking it.
The GSP seems entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
So much better than it's said that there's a Zlatan addiction.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and he has a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves he's the star of League 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he's done is really great.
This drives others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you live with the Euro 2012 team in France?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with playtime.
I've seen things over there, and I've come out stronger.
Today, I am able to make good selection games.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we must have exemplary behaviour.
What are you looking at in the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The picker is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good null (1-1) pulled out on 16 October in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
In contrast to current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and treatment costs between stakeholders.
In addition, as is often seen in these technologies, a political vision is clear: the belief that the current monetary system, which is made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pairs of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the courses are recorded on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this type of system.
But every time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both depositors of the book of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file hacking phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "make" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other knots easily check that it's the right one.
The transaction was then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the fingerprint.
If, to cheat, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves the margin...
The challenge is also identified at each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also notes opportunities for money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Weighted actors like Wikipedia refuse such gifts.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, giants were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a textbook on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus less expensive.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just send them an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users are present.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be needed, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Truck and armored convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban deferring on Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the fights between different factions.
Their control of the country was then seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban are joining in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They moved into businessmen, taking advantage of government land to resell them into lands to build refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American subcontracts.
They have been disappointed; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to benefit from American broads: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, girls as well as boys.
Work will need to be provided to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fraternizing with mobile phones; television, and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that command her be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned with reconstitution of provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, as is the case with Western nations, but the United States has sought to transform it into a centralized state, strong presidential power, removing the position of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled in April 2014.
But her country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and well before.
No industry has been restored, no dam is in repair, no important irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only here to get along.
Without energy to treat iron or copper ore in place, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Aynak's copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the immense Buddhist site and remain the province's most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, will need a long time to re-establish normal reports.
The departure of French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "get hearts and spirits" and to carry out the task impossible to match aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, has carried out, and carried out well by a small French NGO, many collective interests and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, gourmets in local work, was able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable surfaces.
What will we remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa Province.
In order to be released from the insurrection by foreign groups, what farmers have told me to wish for, small, well-controlled and directly affected civil aid should be maintained in their behalf.
A Constitution in Egypt
This is a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its total.
Taking everyone short, he announced, Wednesday, that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this House two additional months to complete its work.
It was soon two years ago that Egypt relied on a provisional text, repeatedly amended what weakened institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For its opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delight", continuing to "treason his word" and "repeat the right".
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that it is a way to get the institutional and political crisis over as quickly as possible by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time forcing the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
In particular, this use of a precipitous vote is due to the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "You either vote for my text, or I keep the full powers," they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, largely Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had shut the door, considering that they could not make their views known.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did likewise.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 replacement members were added to the schedule yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Commenters have also been amused by the fact that one of the day's single differences has been expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the constituent's pendulum was poorly settled.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Subjects of all attention, article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped they could replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article was not modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the Liberals respond, who see only one communication.
For they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of laws with sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, it's worrying because "people called to decide are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see here the beginnings of a theocracy."
The fears of Liberals are also driven by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not olemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" Temper Alexis Bluuet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, yesterday's text is highly criticised because of the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood submits that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious issue: the powers given to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No more than civil trials will be prohibited in military courts, as requested by human rights associations.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
Blasphemy crime is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, particularly the press.
In addition, no articles are more relevant to the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to him, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will show them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre and a sea of salt await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has retained five major reasons for your return to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
Make yourselves indispensable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptismal foundations" will be affected by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the earth of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is in this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers walk through the Rue de la Souffrance or the way of Croix (Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoria), where the trial took place, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, towards the place of the Crucifixion, then to the one of the Onction Peter and the burial.
This is where the Christian center of the world is, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree was raised used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then exhausted.
Travel to a height
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, former refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can go there by their own means.
For others, a telephony takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m high, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which hosts many tourists during the winter.
A shuttle can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
Ski slopes are 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country houses almost 300 museums.
Could not visit all of them during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth diverting.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (the parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also to see: the Art Museum of Tel-Aviv.
It is mainly exposed to the paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of visitors' moulds and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free and gifts are forbidden.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Bright stars.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
The three large resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of it offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and giant aquariums.
Note: you can bathe in the Red Sea even in winter, because the temperature of the water does not descend below 21° while the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The blue water contains flavor and very easily retains the bathers, even those who can't swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are of surreal beauty.
There is a treatment based on salt water, lemon, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also simply to relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are kept by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatoly and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of antiquity.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Persée saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, your destiny will smile.
In Jaffa you will be able to see young married people taking photos from all Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to walk into the Roman theatre, "conquering" the fortress of the Crusades.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (now 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
For urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and high parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activities.
And the workweek begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only cashier food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made of both milk and meat.
It offers a wide range of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, as well as garlic, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, peas balls, mullus beans, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that wander in high air.
We can see them at night sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
These felins love passing places and do not refuse to be praised.
The rental of a car varies depending on the mark from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs on average 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists went to Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on 9 February 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MEPs and human rights activists argue about what will be given by the law on compulsory language testing, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule only concerns those who intend to work in the services, housing, services to individuals and retail.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, knowledge of the language will need to be validated, but also that of the history of Russia and the basis of law.
It will be necessary to validate his language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who have obtained certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Russian-language Institute Pouchkine, the University of People's Friendship, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass reviews throughout the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question in the press many times: what will this give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slaveryism at work".
Many speak of the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Problems arise for unprofessional migrants, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, certify Sebelev, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "traveling" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive numerous complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised something to them, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passport, and they don't get the expected salary," confirmed the Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many Central Asian nationals who want to come to earn money in Russia trust that they do not only know the language of the country where they want to go, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course it is not their fault, but their woe: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow would only be a viable primary education.
Indeed, their families don't even have anything to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equiping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people start to earn money as soon as the opportunity comes.
It's hard when you don't know the language, trust them.
"You feel dizzy and dizzy."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will only be for migrants with legal status.
Without a statute, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defend enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles roubles.
And then we can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have registration, so cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," told journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, a Tajik national.
"Be quick, don't hurt and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of language examination have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Forgery paper comes from an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is twice and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of the power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "papers".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first-time examination to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian weapons carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether they are shots at weddings or killings organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of rubber weapons in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the gun-port permit from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Douma in the near future.
Everyone is not happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "shocking the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "this foolish hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said to the Russian service Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services over a period of six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, we can find in Moscow today any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior asserts that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Quarter.
Screenshot from a site taking arms commands
The first is "the military trail," that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from the law enforcement forces.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
"Protested versions indicate that certain fires were set off to conceal the deficit," the former military said.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and drain weapons into the black market, particularly in Moscow," said one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large part of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"We find local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia formed and organized supply," the former military added.
Where do the guns come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Problem Analysis and Study Centre for Public Administration.
Experts analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, the criminal records and the public data of the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain researchers, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market have been found there "because of the employees whose work is related to weapons," explains the report.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are derived from "hidden fossils".
A salesman and a cabinet consultant who has asked to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one has been buying the weapons found by these illegal search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he says, sellers will look for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a unit teaching, for example a TT gun.
We deliver it to her by passing the merchandise through a grill.
"He transports it in town and sells it for 900 € per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be cleared, they carry out a check-up with illegal arms dealers," the seller added.
"As in a luxury shop "
The seller and buyer are generally found through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "coin" to market.
The price of the gun was given to me on site.
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are vendors in the markets, but there must also come by saying, for example, "On behalf of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't.
Small new people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schematics, he says, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "anything we want."
"I believed in a luxury shop," the military recalls.
There's no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential client, I'm not just buying, we go with the forest vendor and we install a target.
"We let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from its sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where weapons can be purchased "for different uses".
For this, there is no need for any documents and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a specific amount of money," it says on the site "Buying a gun or a machine gun."
Users leave their demands and ask questions.
And we sell to the minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (conserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a vast network of false sites and has collected people who want to buy combat weapons.
People crash on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard about these types of schemes: the site is usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets asserts that by making a request on the site, we can find ourselves without weapons and behind bars.

A Makarov for $100
Buying an illegal firearm, experts believe, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Association "Right to a Gun", you can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of long-term warehouses by the direction of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Department's official data, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the overall number of such crimes has declined by 7% in Russia and is 22.9 miles, while reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs have decreased by 7.8%.
United States: Fast Food and supermarket employees are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through cashier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages of Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave is going to grow up or get drowsy quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel with the increase in the modest wages received by basic employees at Walmart and in the fast restoration chains, the organizers of the demonstrations wish to achieve the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at the time when a heavy rain of balances caught millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggered lightning.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs to organize strike pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything: from layers to hunting rifles through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many of Walmart's low-paid employees only run at their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, particularly because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lift trucks or portable scanners.
The participants in the "Black Friday" events called for an increase in salary, complaining that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who earns $9.5 per hour, it's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists from the California University of Berkley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost the $3.2 billion group.
It is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred the entire increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would bring them back to 46 cents more.
They will spend in just $12.39 more in a year than now.
Walmart supporters noted with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine States and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the stores from 8 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items per second.
Its cash registers made 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
The company's spokesperson Dan Fogleman assured in an interview at the left-hand Huffington Post that in all of Walmart's "less than five" employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a "com operation among so many others" by the organizer union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not much appreciated, which is why they are not yet implemented) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of servings and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food increases over time, but on average, its basic employees earn in New York $8.90 an hour.
Nobody touches less than them in this city.
For me it's inconceivable to live with that sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living in their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wished to remain there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal Newspaper forum we find comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near McDonald's 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, a double-fold increase than the current minimum wage.
They also asked for trade unions to be established in the area of rapid restoration.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing the protestors of a trade union by beatings or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking care of fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that for concrete reasons.
One of the main features is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast restoration chains.
The flagship moment of the protest was the mid-day rally near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you did honestly!"
Protesters have been supported by other New York Democrats in view, particularly by the candidate for Mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support the employees of the rapid restoration in order to obtain a fair wage and the economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important event in the fast restoration sector throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people participated there, while not all of them were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It's difficult to tell now whether this mass movement spark will make small ones.
"For the moment, we can only get around to brain deception."
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing the reality increased through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google who unveiled this summer's current model at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is evident from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists in this company, glasses are already of ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in bare-handed air, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Can you in a few words tell us what your research group is doing?
- We're working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time trying to widen the borders of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment in pixels on flat screen and sometimes in touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in ordering the gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, a lot of things take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information capture has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, is not really.
We are trying to change this and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of ours, into the physical world, make it more touchy.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we can complement the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that it is panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, every kind of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order appliances in public places, we had a project for which we were thinking about gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet held by the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by mixed order, for example: gesture + voice.
- Is that so?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this cane?
You would do so with words and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or can not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
It can be laser sensors, for example, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely on our work on 3D recognition.
Of course it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are pretty good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
The resolution should be kept in mind according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s really are not enough, especially for actions.
Steven Bathiche, of our Redmond laboratory, gave the sensors a regular delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would need such a device in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more frames to the second.
- But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "camera", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a common sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or push it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a soft product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As long as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, walking with a smartphone all the time the hands up is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that's what makes them strong (the personal elements are the only ones you can see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be very good at adding touch feelings.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a specific point where the finger is and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, of an air breath on the ends of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on wrists that influence nerve endings of fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool your brain?
Make him think he's feeling what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will take a long time to do something wrong: the way to make someone believe physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of race carpets (raise with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, only half of the brain has been deceived, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in absolute condition of fertilization.
The kingdom of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The avant-garde petersbourgeois" dedicated to the citadians who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already hosted prominent actors from the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and who have found a recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravert painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed red that one can cross near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the linked parties and varnishes.
Kirill Miller's paintings always bring together crowds, regardless of their place of exposure.
He is one of the most deeply social and philosophical peter-bourgeois accountants, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the Peter-bourgeois vanguard in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance smiles on the inhabitants and puts them in good mood.
He recently took into his hands a organ of Barbarie and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg as he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you running the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, image creator and society.
Even though in society, everything that is not gray gives rise to aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you understand that you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Culture Palace where my work was located.
I understood it was my way.
Then the wave of the old unofficial painters was passed and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to associate with the painters of the new wave, with those of Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
- It was important for me to find myself in the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which before the works housed a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Pétersbourgeois bohemian bohemian.
Many were born there: NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends were singing easy play-back songs in grinding jerseys, including Igor Vdovin, a fashion composer today.
When the group started to perform live, it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg did not have bad programming before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great career began, but his basic training and education, he received them from us.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboiedov": these are the effects of the artistic Clinic.
Our employees left as regular employees.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was held in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Pein of the Year," and it was then that my kingdom ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong update and acuity.
I'm going to have an exhibition programmed "The Russian Museum Through Clowns".
Clowns belong to a temporary category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scary to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything gets out, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the housing that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to scrape him with the trunk.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- We've seen you recently in the role of the organ player of Barbarie.
Who else I can play.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be careful, delicate, liqueur.
Disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into flocks, supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, they negated another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communitys, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people we threw out who come to see, the sexual and social side is walking.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and at the end of the account it's less management, money, everything perishes.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin the life.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones that are painted at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not all can work in culture.
Under the reign of good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars didn't understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are disparate, because there is a need for higher experts who will properly assess these experts and make a way for them.
At present, it is the "kingdom of taste" that blooms.
The same Eratta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In us, this layer is very fine.
We need to make art fashion as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg scholarship
Listen in space
Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with landowners on board go looking for a relief planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how can we continue to live our species as a rocker or on a planet of relief?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, it would be only by chance.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICH).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at Venus surface is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitude or on Venus' orbit... in space.
We began to take an interest in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Another half century ago, we were experimenting on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown on orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then we put on the orbit of insects, small drosophile flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to the space to see how an embryo was developed in a pendant.
We get a perfectly normal chick at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, it has to get on its feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
When no support was found, the chicks were disorderly.
And at the end of 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts totally atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die after four days.
"We shook their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only board species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus in space.
In principle, we didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. This kind of research has to be done," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's not a bad deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, he is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female body is what humanity has most precious.
Our moose flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would keep after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," said Vakhtang Vachnadzé, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaiev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, after being on orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have very little, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this poses a danger even during the orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
Yet, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Centre for the Preparation of Cosmonauts: Compulsory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero floatability, cosmonauts are trained in extra-vehicle outputs.
Water imitates the weigher.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibians seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
To the extent that the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's womb, it is easier for him to then get used to water.
It is in principle logical, because from birth to its first bath, it only takes 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the pendant is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a weight force.
In the weigher, the muscles of the belly, the pool are atrophy very quickly, the baby's push capacity is lost.
All right, let's just ignore this by relying on the delivery simulators.
Of course we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will get him out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite him to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the terrestrial attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress a baby like an adult with a special combination for training.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a totally disabled child," says the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality, when the Terrians will travel on their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born into space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Public Finance Control Institute) said: "The control of the independent pseudo-work (Czech " Švarc system ") failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and high-quality legislation but is lagging behind in its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the Vice-President of the Higher Financial Control Institute, said in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," said Kala in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint check by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " Švarc system " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS is not going to import contractors with controls; is this allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting compliance with the law," says Kala.
At the supervisory committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the public procurement legislation in these two countries was compared.
What was he actually asking about?
This is a parallel check we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation and how to implement it.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure is not yet completed, very interesting differences have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more severe and better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continuously develop more and more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project actually help you and what is the result for you?
A common control of this type should just help to stop us from trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the market thresholds, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It could be that this system is so submerged by the paperwork, that those who search for the faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained above.
You are talking about internal problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our CSI or a different organization mode?
As regards institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof is operating there, which is organized similarly, it also has a slightly different council, but these two institutions are basically proceeding similarly.
Skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance compared to our system: Germany being a federal structure, so it also has such accounts at the level of the different Länder.
HRB can only control federal money, which corresponds to the state's resources in our home.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities at home are monitored there at the level of the Länder accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said to do better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider as a model is also faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage to cooperate with our institution, would they?
As regards national legislation, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant to you as an institution, have its effects already been felt?
Since this amendment came into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we do back-up checks, we must count on a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, at the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for "detection of the risks of mismanagement" with which we have gone to the crisis of nearly 14,000 public contracts - there will of course be these changes, because the thresholds have been changed, as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law to be a benefit or an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the contract law meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful, then, to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but do not punish those who make formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put greater pressure on administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the SDO would not import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting and requiring compliance with the law.
He may declare: "We will change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was.
The Contracts Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, just to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
Roads are by frozen places, but most remain practical.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practical this morning, but by frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures have fallen and fluctuate between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should rise slightly in the day.
Snowfalls have ceased in the region and it remains in the plains only a thin layer of snow.
However, the ridges of the Metaliferous Mountains (Krušné hour) are covered about 30 centimeters of snow.
The data from the regional road maintenance service show that due to fog, visibility was reduced by places.
The R6 rapid route and the national roads in the region are now available without difficulties.
However, vigilance remains to be placed, for example on certain bridges whose coating can be frozen and sliding.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
It remains on some of their sections of frozen snow remnants and by traffic-tight spots.
Especially in areas at altitude, drivers must strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and of Hradec Kralové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some East Bohemian roads are threatened by the formation of verglas and that traffic-tight snow layers can be found on roads in mountainous areas and located at altitude.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of vertical formation in areas of the Pardubice region located at altitude.
There may be verglas in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-tight snow is present on roads in areas at altitude.
In Bohemian East, time will now be dry, most often clear, with possible cloud passages.
It will have a low wind and temperatures will generally range from -3° to +1°C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are now feasible, although, in places, there is a need for increased vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3° and -9°C.
After the last snowfall and the subsequent cooling, some channels of communication may be by frozen locations.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, however, visibility will gradually improve.
This is what the information from the regional road maintenance service indicates.
However, the D5 motorway is nearly without difficulty, and road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-South and in the district of Tachov.
Departmental and third-class pathways are wet and in this case warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Olomouc region at altitude today must have a thick, soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the neck called "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
Snowfalls have forced road maintenance personnel to travel to the field tonight; according to road services, more than three centimeters have fallen into the Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most of the roads are safe.
" On the heights of the Šumperk district are snow remnants.
Drivers travelling in the direction of Jeseník must expect to meet the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" a thick and soft snow layer "today told ČTK the head of road maintenance services in Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also went on site during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment performed, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc roads are easy to use, however, drivers in the district of Šternberk should pay attention in sections in forest areas to the remaining wet roads.
Regions of Ustí nad Labem and Liberec
Since this morning, the northern Bohemian road maintenance services have reported several difficult sections.
The police data show that, in addition to some snow-covered or glassy places, the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, and therefore snow and verglas should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south east of Bohemian Central Plateau, there is, on the contrary, no problems and roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported for the time being.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, particularly around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow source during the day, sky clear and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic routes, difficult conditions are also reported on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Kninice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of the snow until reaching the pavement.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps we love to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh rather and say that we are the only group capable of collecting a rest of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you set up a completely unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years now.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the eve of 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end at the time of the end of the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded an anthem against the end of the world, entitled "End of the Canceled World " (Czech " Kontec světa zrušeno ").
She is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear her at these charitable concerts?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also be joined at a given time as part of a very unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also played the main role of Jesus in the video, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, because we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We strive to have them participate intensively in these projects.
It has proved that most of them are interested in such cooperation and are amused.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on within the framework of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, and that for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students at Jedličkovskyv Institute and offer them activities that interest them and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project into a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers come up on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, have you chosen them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will be on stage.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; here too, we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic house in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so bad that it looks like it's at first.
We have five electric wheelchair members whose gears must travel by lot, of course we also pack a lot of luggage and toolboxes....
Until now everything has been more or less always well done, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have your experiences been so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow only in the east is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still not accessible to people with disabilities; there it is not common yet that a person moves alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it clear to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association striving to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
What do we still need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with heavy disabilities move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities is one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, so let's go back a few years, what led you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And since I am myself a musician (among others I play saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá the Angelovič says, we have lost some control of the situation (Laughter).
Did success happen only in recent years, if I'm not wrong?
True, creating links with known singers and working actively to promote the group helped us.
We understood that if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's grants, we can also enable us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of things that copy each other.
In some ways, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I can say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
They are people who can live a whole life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not only an advance for them but for society as a whole.
Is not your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to the rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the streets for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
Just one, Lá the Angelovič.
We're an open group, people go in and out, there's nothing there.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the day before the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 beginning at 21 hours.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relays when the song of the band The Tap Tap " End of the Canceled World " will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre located in Prague in Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket at this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the ticket preview is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of that agency, the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of the Agency's projects.
However, Poland's road to space started much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always find understanding.
I would like to refer, for example, to the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold auditors and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie Award in France and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of the world-renowned astronaut, his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters on the hidden side of the Moon.
By 1925 a drain was constructed in Poland to be equipped with a rocketed engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
Nor is it clear whether the rocket should be used to propulse or stop the drain.
The only information known about this drama is that of the press of the day.
From 1933 onwards, Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rockets.
The research was conducted by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the retained documents that this research had reached the stage of the tests.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photo-hunting rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects aimed at military use of rocket engines.
Just prior to the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the interim scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Comitéet Doradczo-Nukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works on the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a company in the November 1954 issue of the issue newspaper, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to the aircraft.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create an astronomical society
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) made efforts to join the international Astronautic Federation (created in 1951) and as early as the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He kept his job until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna) meteorological fusion, which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version was constructed, RM-1A and during the summer of 1959, two-stage RM-2 rocket flight tests were started in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have reached up to 14.5 km and served to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket was developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of equipment was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were constructed.
Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The repeal of the Public Use Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public utility.
This decision in public opinion raised a lively discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in concrete terms that the various economic entities and national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free (unbound) movement of private capital coupled with a fraught financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) generate tension over prices.
The following meaning should be put under this heading: a producer strives to import goods sold at low prices which are resistant to economic competition by "making the price of the competitor more expensive" in order to remove a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad or buying at low prices or disappearing. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and therefore responsibility vis-à-vis the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the State are necessarily increasing.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect bad will of the gentlemen of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for the benefit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create a situation in different economies in which governments in different countries are forced to compete in each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments place their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking account of social collapse.
This is mainly evident in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the dictate of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This occurs on the one hand through a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and the restriction of employees' rights in the field of labour law.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
For years, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that employees receive such wages that the State is obliged to pay a supplement to achieve the vital minimum.
Such a scandal has, for example, been updated in the case of employees working as an assistant to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the Member States of the south of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as in the 19th century) or to live with wages of poverty, on the edge of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The question must be asked here: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also concerns all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue, to their detriment, that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must therefore ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not govern, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the entire state.
The answer to this question is no doubt true.
The evidence is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby in all States.
As a result, there is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is punishable but not punishable.
In FRF, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the development of bills to law firms closely related to industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as stated in Western-type constitutions, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The state was long in delicacy and the functions were attributed to violence.
The blows of wine pots, the unlawfully obtained favors, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold ... ... "The honest people did not seek to obtain any functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls" ... 'We really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"...It is true that Appianos had Pompey in mind, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absoluteist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, regardless of the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
Today, as in the past, it results in a decline without prior elites, with no effort to carry out comprehensive reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for liberal-type democracies can be seen as a kind of break before a new stage.
The fact that current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human life losses, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnessing today, as well as crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Use Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, at both international and European level, the Czech Republic Government will continue to seek ways of reducing the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: chaos laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will be able" says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the refract is "let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be war," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer's wife Amschel Rothschild on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing its right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoke racism of the State of Israel, genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and regard Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; sum all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a "back to the curtain" point of view on the one that mainly benefits from the tensions that have been continuing for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of Middle East countries.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely from the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or owed their actions to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to take place in a single generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished from the Rothschild family, which could be regarded as the head of the peacock (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
From the 90s of the 19th century, they acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts to which they were mixed and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase of their wealth or both.
They have major participations in almost most central banks in the world and are preparing or waging wars against countries where they have not yet had such participations (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after Iraq's invasion of 5, after the overthrow of Kadhafi only of 4, in the meantime Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of a central bank at the Bank of America of Rothschild and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I hear well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to try a trial against the EDF for triggering the major economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for global power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a free-mason initiated at the 33rd level, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second war was to eliminate colonialism, especially British colonialism, and the third war should reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid repeating crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After successfully unleashing the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to Habsburg to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war suddenly ended with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the massacre of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier launch of the Second World War, the bankers have allowed politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they have imposed pharaine war repairs on Germany, thus generating the conditions for radicalization of the impoverished masses (they are sufficient to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the guilty, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, creating a Czechoslovakia made up of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (which they actually held) of fifth column to set the fire to powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspired to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of the Historical Jude with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
Balfour's statement mentioned above laid the basis for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers initially held it; or whether everything he did was planned, however, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in concentration camps created the basis of the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war repairs imposed on Germany were the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit up a firehouse that could trigger a third world war.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people divide roughly between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where another harm arises according to a circle of endless violence and where, at the very outset, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the world is found?
Here we must make a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as we do, the international bankers offer people only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascist politicians, loyal to international bankers, who do everything in their power to wage war with Iran, who could, due to the country's accession to Shanghai's cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) extend to become a global conflict and since Iran controls the Ormuz Strait through which it transits 20% of all world oil (this naval corridor has only a width of 2 miles) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
What light now appears to David Rockefeller's words in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which any new born person is introduced at birth an electronic chip making him a completely controlled person.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry on the hand or forehead a mark to the red iron, that they may neither buy nor sell the one that does not bear the name of that ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that the one who has good sense counts the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number means man and it's six hundred sixty six."
The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a number of protesters composed of Islamist students attacked the American Embassy of Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the U.S. administration a positive outcome, and it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, which was further aggravated by the fiasco of attempts to free hostages by force.
The diplomats kidnapped were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States creates a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle played a major role in Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated periods, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rocambolesque cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team to make screenings for a major science fiction show.
Combination of genres
Tony Mendez's Explosive Expert Plan requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialist stores reported this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation were long kept secret, and the film was based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of many genres.
This is on the one hand a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - for example, in the Ocean's levan trilogy, twelve and thirteen.
The ambiances follow: sequences of documentary-style Tehran (in the sub-titled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been re-translated into the film, there are no major differences),
Hollywood's lighter passages, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, corridors and telephone...
Ben Affleck managed to reboot his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected actor and his acting game stopped triggering ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long film after the dark cop "Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in its original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability when sudden, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the false shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to be content with a subject offering in fact only a few exciting scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It works out very well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is removed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway is quite drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operatives, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it lets itself be seen with moderate interest, appreciating the achievement and retro style of the 1970s.
He drives the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of yet another story, in a certain way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscients, he does the business.
Rules for swelling balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who conducts an annual public survey of the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has been considering, in recent times, adopting a 40% quota of women for the management of large European companies has been at the heart of our decision," said the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, for example, there is already a recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Up to now, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they are objectively at a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other idea as incredible as the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio-components to fuels, which have adverse environmental consequences, or the prohibition on using reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low quantity of dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, resulting in increased egg prices.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of de facto use of the term "butter to tartin" or the withdrawal of the sale of classical bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (so the Czech Republic currently imposes demands on its banks by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, the origin of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonizing non-homogenous national standards that complicated trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have been softened despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives result in food waste.
The first price may be awarded in this investigation to the EU Regulation of last year that must include on inflatable balloons a warning that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American investigation that balloons are, among toys, the first cause of deaths of children by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age with regard to blowing in fair trumpets.
In us too, we have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, everyone with official office within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonian" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Let Do" association of Liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server appointed, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then goes beyond, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risk, therefore, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants.
However, these ideas are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have the sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund."In the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the Jaroslav Palas period (ČSSD).
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had met with full stocks which it had subsequently to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organized a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for the award of grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which should in particular be used to write applications for subsidies granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "Bird regulations are rare".
While the regulations often give rise to criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the field of its overall development deserve more praise.
For example, experts say that the problem of using EU grants for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States in budgetary negotiations, is more serious.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries in the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (the fight which it does not always win) gives rise to strong emotions in Czechs.
If, after six years of fighting against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomucké tvar tilležky", for the name "Tuzemský rum" that goes back to our home in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar, and not on beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
In the official list of EU registered products, there are now known worldwide cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the massepain of Lübeck or Parme ham, the Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carps of Pohořelice and Třeboň ("Pohořelický a Třeboňský kappr") and the hopon of Žatec ("Žatecký chmel").
Pardubice's spice bread ("Pardubický pernik") and cakes called "Hořice's Cornets" ("hořické trubičky") may also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, Senator Okamura says
Senator, how is the idea of being presented in the presidential elections?
It's not like being a senator or president that counts for me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been pillaged for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that doesn't please, then I try to make a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and am independent, a member of no party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or Senate elections.
You entered the Senate, but you quickly set off for the Castle (N.D.T.: Chair's seat).
Do you not turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I've always said that I'm going to go into battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later on, I stated that if I was elected Senator, I would introduce myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that enables me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we crawl at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we tread on those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition, the press breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I suspect journalists or that I have been JIří Paroubek's advisor.
Let's come to your visions.
You started the battle for the Castle with as a battle horse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [CZK].
You have to change the law for this purpose.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I pressed for tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained cause.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or right with a good project, it is scientifically denied and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get support from all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you think of yourself as a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we were going forward.
What matters to me is not whether people are left or right but to gather people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said didn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I am talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken about them.
But without the support of parliament, you only have slogans left.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose them.
If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to retransmit my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties on live television to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want to.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuses, it will be possible to press the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, it was obtained through pressure from public opinion.
I confess, without ambiance, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things forward alone, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also present themselves in the Senate elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, most of them gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct vote by mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to set up your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial resources.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate about 60 million the value of my personal property.
In Prague I have a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artworks worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a child's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You're running in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million worth of assets and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I turn myself in?
I've already invested 2 and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign fees are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example paying for my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I'm not going to run for any elections.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd turn your activities into deaf?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor?
I won and I keep winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that the real adventures are not only about imagination. To convince themselves, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected book mountains - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, at last something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig tells us, a pass on the downside of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large neighbouring company, tells us: "Yes, it's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
Today, no one's doing his own thing in one of these Ranggard libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing attractive at the doors of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniature painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to resume their hands on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the architects' office of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of daring stick diagrams and creator of mind-filled and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual phlegm and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a scratch on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking, bewildered and wringing their shoulders, Maas, confronting him, stacking his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ending his speech supported by activist arguments by a: "common cry!"
Here it is, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, or as it is said, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain has cleared the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and some mitoyen buildings and houses for a total of 50 homes.
Early in November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
This is how this small terne village, which so far had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a mayorate of a juicy laideur, whose white facades invite them to think they sheltered a dairy, has enriched a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
True, an elevator carries you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you soak the floor of the building in the discovery of its topography.
The interior is entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant reverberations speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and small boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally, library rays are along the facade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We have completely altered the classic spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been properly arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environment centre and the building's technical centre.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes lambers, sometimes balustrades, sometimes climbing ramps.
A new experience for the view, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the durcis building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in an agricultural company.
In the Netherlands, for years the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thickness has been used as substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The membrane finer is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was first compressed in such quantities in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 metres, the literary café offers us an impressive view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pot ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute mainly to maintaining the ideal level of air moisture in the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project for ecology," Trouborst says.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal temperature.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only gives light to the interior, even to the days of beautiful weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across from the glass façade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores are responsible for the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computerist, has already risked entering the new library.
Liste Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has helped to fill the gaps in the library which has not yet been fully filled (now it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays overflow everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline that is called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new literary history page.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
This is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose abstention at the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian demand for observer status in the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think she doesn't support the American position either.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, however, without being too critical to Israel.
At the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen abstention when voting on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so as to be defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore face several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
External policy, such as France or Great Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It expresses its willingness to adopt independent positions from those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and abstention at the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important achievements in the Near East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to stumble upon public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this because it is not an exclusive unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic reflections.
Does Germany interfere with its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will only be respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are varied.
On the other hand, the United States announced their veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the U.S. domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, of course, the government cannot publicly defend its position.
I believe that the true differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem so.
If you observe relations between Obama and Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from overwhelmed by enthusiasm for Netanyahou's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners?
I think it doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today that is not the case.
They cannot therefore enter a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my opinion, Germany will play a role in the future as a locomotive and will encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This has always been a delicate question.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that marks their independence more.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, and does Germany want only to play a key role?
Or is it still difficult to play a leading role?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulty playing a more important role.
If one looks at, for example, the crisis of the euro, it is noted that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed with a wide range of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only decreasing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this gap, but who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're less appreciated, it's life!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America jointly analyse the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Protection of Trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well known brands all over the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially deposited in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing the name cannot complain.
And even if she could, she's not sure she'd get a cause.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, specialized in violation of the right to property in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my office.
The copyists only need a few extra letters to be able to record their brands.
So, instead of Gucci, we register Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the sports goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a ranking in which records are made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the Zegna DF Puma brand, a name that the firm artificially created by taking part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a fact known that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, shopping centres are located on several floors that sell practically only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his commanders charge him to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai" as a relative brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are appointed to marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say there's nothing to blame for.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of justice are in millions for the sectors concerned, especially as regards expensive light products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest developed market.
However, it is not easy to delete the dubious registrations of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticised had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarism because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of jungle dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's buyer, used before a blue and white logo that reminded BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against the plagiars of Hong Kong and Singapore which had redirected the view of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO Trademarks Office in Beijing admits that it was a few difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and space.
However, last year, the Office would have spent an "emergency situation in the course of work on a normalized basis".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were reportedly closed, representing a 75% increase over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain in suffering at the office.
Act at a cost
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the TMO received more than 1.4 million trademark filing applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and it means that China is located for the tenth consecutive time in the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have counted 1.8 billion yuan of registration right.
In other words, each record reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components was suspended.
However, the issuer was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The Trademarks Office therefore rejected the Munich objection.
Freudenberg has certainly gained cause from the following two instances, but the other side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is in place
Today, the case is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges.
However, he adds: "the procedure is long, difficult and it costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. Archival service has even had to review the actions of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large six-digit euro sum" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see for ourselves," Wentzler said.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow into Europe.
This would be the case if copyists in this region would ensure the exploitation of unprotected trade marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Warning is put."
Pattloch and advises German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
According to them, it is not enough to rely on international trade marks law, but foreigners should "registrate also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, costs can be much more important than registration costs.
If Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence rights to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as explained by Wentzler.
Or we would lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: tap foot, sing, help
The Choral Imbongi repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of Swaziland AIDS rejoice in their coming.
Here is the story of a link that crosses far more than a distance of 8.733 kilometers.
First, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, basketballs, women's scarves and moccasins for men are looking for the rhythm by hitting the foot floor. Very soon, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers slowly expand - high, low, tenor and soprano -, they win, whistling and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years old came from genetician in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choirman has different words, all in a very exotic language: the Zoulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Helping to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per minute, we can become sponsors.
This amount guarantees the child money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal in the gogo center.
Imbongi means "story storyteller" or "singer of praise" in Zulu.
No one can commonly speak the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choral has been repeating songs in this foreign language that she has brought to Germany for now to her native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometres by flight of Heidelberg birds, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40 per cent of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw huts or land and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can see on a smaller scale the evils that plague Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of half infection.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is infected with immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in mid-30s.
On a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choral had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis mainly saw many children on the street who were lacking not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is absolutely no prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has been working almost professionally for the orphans of the AIDS of Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ISTs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhage (or gonorrhea).
Current ISTs are HIV, human papillome virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubis and gala dust belong to parasitic ISTs.
Which groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhage often appear in men who have sexual intercourse with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is the origin of at least four cases of syphilis in five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungic), blennorrhage and human papillome virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections concern young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillome virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases more than doubled in 10 years: the figure increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genital organs, urinary pain, white loss, lower ventricular pain, and the appearance of buttons and locks.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes sex partners should regularly pass examinations.
Most rapidly detected ISTs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, gifts, but especially the funds that the choirists reap through their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of herself and who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that orphans are housed in one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, this is what old women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one else is welcomed to a safe place at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals every day for over 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school and allows the construction of two chickens. With the support of the US health organization PSI, the association has organized an HIV testing for many people.
This is not true of itself, because even if the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that touches sexuality."
It's pretty curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These measures sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found at every corner of the street, says Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi chorists travel together every two or three years in southern Africa and sing full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many of the residents on the tip of the black continent still know of apartheid time.
The bus full of white singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it generates not only good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears out a tear to some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the Chorists visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," people say there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres flying bird, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choirists who tap foot in the rehearsal room of the Bergeimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on Earth Mercury.
The ice layer could be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA's US Space Agency has proven the existence of ice on Earth Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe provided evidence of the existence of ice cover in the planet's region continuously plunged into the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that could go up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or maybe from asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one links the discovery of water with the assumption of a presence of life on the planet, explains the leading scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other life-critical elements have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Out of sight of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe infinity.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet naine Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Cerès is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink spots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the birth room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars are born, named "W5", a very romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant burst of a star dying.
The beignet-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when she dies.
In the immense Trifide nebula, at 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, star lovers also called "the seven sisters", can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope enhances the colors.
On this infrared picture, the Helice nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is located at 700 light-years in the constellation of Verseau.
His similarities with a land continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and clearest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the dye, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of Trifide in the constellation of Sagittaire, several thousand light-years.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust tranadas divide the glowing heart of the star's birthplace.
Astronomicals photographed the precipices of one cosmic carambola in the Serpentaire constellation: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two fusion galaxies rush each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "austral firewheel".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula, in the constellation of Cephée.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years and consists of dust grains that are ten to 100 times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo has been produced from optical and radiographic clicks taken by different telescopes.
You can see there the circle of black holes that is at 430 million light-years of Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies named Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars on our dairy path.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are linked by the Rosette nebula, also continuously create young stars at 5,000 light-years of Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and penetrated from a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our gaze on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Observatory of Mount Palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, in the United States, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle level, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle level.
Its particularity is due to its great capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo Radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help with the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing the computing power of its machine.
View on the Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés by 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on Mauna Kea's Hawaiian volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They treed two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that watches the sky with the Subaru and IRTF telescope.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
The task of the telescope will be to find light designed by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury also houses ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Mercure Pole.
Radar data had for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There's even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There's even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is of a sophisticated romanticism.
The small bus runs along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms around the road.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where we see the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh, about which we don't know much, unless they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and have a very long life.
Terminus: Lyrics.
The small town with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometres, because the road only has one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilatea Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year, there will be here the oldest festival in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of such in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh from the region that are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a picture in black and white.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
Having another child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no act of birth.
And when we think that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a girl.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about man at the high age of Central Asia.
"Obviously old people also live in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz said, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the lack of documentation, without including the absence of a civil record.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is true that people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of that country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have specific genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that food rich in calories from Talysh, which loves meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter every day, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengeiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground next to a basket, of which it beats the contents untiringly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have been grown up for a long time.
Two small children also squat in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests serving in typical belly-shaped armed glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long pieces of a dark blonde that his son reveals to us with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," said Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
All my life, I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of propaganda is amazing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who nevertheless ruled his country as a dictator, had almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham subsequently succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly people of Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats monthly (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, an amount that guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-singing son is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared and happy.
That is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on charia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not without words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but especially for Christian Coptes, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
Because all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost in his apology, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers "to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a Ph.D. from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overturned?
The 234 items written hastily by the predominantly Islamic assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night force tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal manoeuvre that stems from it to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it suggests a newly introduced article which states that, with regard to all subjects relating to the sharia, the al-Azhar university should be consulted. The establishment is the country's most important Islamic institution and its burst spread across the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would in fact result in the judicial supervision.
Many points in the draft Constitution are matters of interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts were working to punish opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, as it can read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censoring.
In addition, no articles expressly guarantee equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or difaming Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what is an offense or how it should be punished.
Also doubtful is the wording which implies that it is forbidden to "offense" people.
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?
Many points are, therefore, matters to be interpreted in the draft which Morsi put to the vote and which, according to his own words, will be "very soon" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution was reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to drop the charia before it comes into force.
"The revolution is coming back and we're going to win," Hamdin Sabbahi launches, third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is "to be cast into the garbage of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expired," said the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other shore of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and the Salafist supporters, who participated in it in large numbers, scanned: "the people demand the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Koran [was their] Constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic place of Tharir, where everything began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, this is what Morsi supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that the opposition to the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had expressed themselves loudly and loudly.
In their view, it is now time to let the people decide by the polls of the direction that the country must take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have extended until February and encompass all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did not do so because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was shot, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are a flagrant violation of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto withdraws all his powers from him," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be paid.

The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most smelling fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely smelling fish?
Have some advanced cheese.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothing.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk is composed of salty, fermented trout in the water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and becomes cold, Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people are affluent with small pieces of fish and are steeped in a lot of drinks.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," says Harvard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi who would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, fish was immersed in airtight water barrels and then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses softened by alcohol - food.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigranting to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a full health system.
The Swedish, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered as something important, a vital element, although smelling, of Norway's past.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small beer pint or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to displease it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they speak of "the July 22 incident."
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," explains Anna, our servant, with the blond hair and in the eyes of a transcending blue, the image of northern well-being, with a rakfisk plateau in her hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with much caution - all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries were throwing money through the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep the ropes of its tight stock exchange.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," she adds in an unwary laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and I'm doing the tail to buy me what to eat - I had my rakfisk dose.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of propellers, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where rakfisk is used for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a nozzle, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
We would believe in Eurovision's competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here we are, Harvard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the water abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC, is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at present.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal time, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president of the nation.
A complicated task awaits you.
Mexico's economy is doing well, with results due to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is facing a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to American President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the American president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very popular and tentacular state that locks the capital. On its preferred land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A Direct Man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises assign it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of M Pena Nieto's new motorways, an important improvement has been made to these roads, formerly bossilated and full of cracks.
Plates bearing its name are attached outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to put in place lasting changes," said his political friend and ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and the party of Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economics, in particular, we hope for a real change our country needs so much.
After 81 years without failing to hold office, the PRI was won in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside Los Pinos' presidential palace, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticisms of the opponents who blame the new president for lack of charism.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent state man and, above all, he can listen.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the motorways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military were called to the rescue to combat drug gangs in neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, dozens of women killed in the last two years have been found on the verge of unloading.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to identify the problem of killings perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse their administration of refusing to see reality in front of them.
In a concrete house, typical of this degraded neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came home, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs. Bundiia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the body stiffness had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana clothes the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old Commerar, a troublemaker, a fluster.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, a member of the Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
The prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning would have been subjected to during detention.
The trial concerns the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Defence wants to classify the case because Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate, Friday, that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the biggest leak of confidential information from the entire history of the U.S. military -- missed many occasions to complain about the ill-treatment he claims he has suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein stated that weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, was accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked questions in Manning and recorded their answers.
When Fein referred to the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment he had reserved for his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had in prison was globally "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not report the issues raised.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet it did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the Special Commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for risk of suicide -- for his protection and for the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted this status to be withdrawn... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and had disappeared once because of the heat.
He added that not knowing what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or staying lying during the day was contrary to the regulations.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he came back at night, they would wake him up to see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning questions about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stay naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning, during the call.
Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from his guard's order that he should let go of his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to let her go.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his brief or his tongs to hurt himself, but he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be found guilty before a court of law, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defence stated that Manning plans to plead guilty of the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed to be too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that conditions of detention are justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of Internet information, and the transmission of national defence information.
If all the charges are held, he is indicting the life-threatening criminal re-enactment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexico-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, on arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for the Mexicans ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Extrangers").
I stayed still for a few seconds, not knowing what line to go to.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic qualification, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they say "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became Mexican-American.
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that saw my grandfather born, there was no need for special qualifications or ties of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in one or the other language.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the "Foreigners" file.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their priority themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk in the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for trade on the European Union model, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half of their territory to the point of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and not for minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want us to address the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer.
The only reason that the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, has found no opportunity in Mexico and has had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a type profile -- a dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree to it in the United States.
We also know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they touch us as if we were individuals of lower strain and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our links with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed while living in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not be stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who had legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, because Mexicans are more strongly demanding their identity and Mexico-Americans are opposed to it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like being in two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like being in one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we're considered Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must absolutely visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen links with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And when we consider the inequalities in wages, corruption and drug-related violence that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, guys.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States of America for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want to do so in the way that their family members have been treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is vain.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel-Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full motion.
The Arab Spring has blown up everything, and whether or not it is desired, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify further.
However, there is every reason to think that this could help them get out of this deadly deadlock.
A war that does no loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Although the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week's fights have strengthened the partisans of force, on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will no doubt have forced the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has suffered a riot.
Having killed some of its leaders and refusted the 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most miserable and overpopulated corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas gains ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals of Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Arab world's Islamists is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has made and caused Hamas; as is Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members jubilate and say that the growing Islamist bends around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and even Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to dedicate to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily turned to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the reverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was handed over.
The Iron Dome-Baptized Missile Interception System proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the source of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket shots in Gaza had killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel had been spared by suicide bombings, particularly through the separation barrier that interfered with the West Bank, the main part of what might be a Palestinian state, and which protected Jewish colonies that continued to extend despite their illegal international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Lukud merged with an even more belligerent party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman near the election on 22 January, has the beautiful part.
Why do you suck these Palestinian chips by giving them a status?
If they were leading the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of the line will take it; but it may be that the Arab spring changes the gift.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to tackle problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments manage their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which is of good cheer -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dust that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a little like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
Repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have diplomatic prizes.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The response remains the one advocated by reasonable people on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which is now to strive to put an end to the movement of weapons into Gaza, as Turkey and Qatar are better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very eccentric vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for Neutral Cigarette Packs came into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand name
This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark green olive and horrible pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the world's strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Pibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and while these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would boost trade in the black market, which would make it easier to access less expensive cigarettes.
"Bad consequences will arise from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco Australia.
China's and Indonesia's counterfeiters will sell more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others stated that this law had dynamized their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarettes, especially in silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has greatly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco contested the law and lost before the high court of Australia.
He said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only nuisance, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population range targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning advertising on TV, sports sponsorship and the obligation for resellers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and only have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the perfect place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of certain Lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Do we have to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been worth making a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry went to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade dealings with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Pibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make package warning photos mandatory in 2001.
At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More severe laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
I don't mind the pictures.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you place the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package on which a photo of mouth tumor appears.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack Tobacconist" in central Sydney, said that uniformity of packaging made storing packages on shelves difficult.
"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's good, we stop and we put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spend a half-day at an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting the duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child praise the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to borrow interesting ways, even to feed creativity.
And since most of us are constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes up a long way," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke the boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed, in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University, Ontario, Canada.
After having gone through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists "to want to do something, but not succeed in engaging in a satisfactory activity."
What differs the trouble of apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although she would like it.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the trouble, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a blizzard mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The boredom can look like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or from the world, while depressed people think that the problem is from them.
Sometimes we think we're bored while it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Uninvolved Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the paper "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted a more ancient experience in which participants listened to tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, coming from the next room, the sound too high from a TV show that had no report, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not at all hear the soundtrack.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said that they were more upset than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but they did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult task or stakeholders, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an aggregate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like looking at objects on a assembly chain, music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he says now, we know that when we are torturing or griffing, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to remain more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigot learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "predisposition scale to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "For the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centers of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to get more bored than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quick to blame.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported becoming bored at school and during their homework at home, while 23 per cent reported becoming bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a period when trouble reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: Is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to take absurd physical risks, betting or abusing certain substances to spend time, as studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers point to a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or self-regulation, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from situation to situation," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant boiling that generates activities and technology is the goal that we should tend to.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens a keen and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate stopping times.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directives for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his condition: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his use - minor crimes, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been ranked without further delay.
Police services have ceased to charge adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of commercial sales of marijuana approved by the state in their neighbourhoods.
"Things evolve so quickly that I don't know what the future holds," said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of Aurora Police, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking themselves questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a licensing system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is desired or not, is in advance of most marijuana regulation states, first about therapeutic use and now about personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and it is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith recognizes, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no precedent on which we could rely," he said.
The law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a legal vacuum of one year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical questions remain outstanding: how to balance the state's mandate that guarantees adequate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales within a radius of 30 km around a school, park, playground or day care.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Centre for the Legalization of cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City aroundy" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer pursue those 21-year-olds who had small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging people for this "immediate effect" crime.
Chief Oates stated that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the " District around" (Procurator of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly in order to pressure users to become detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many are charged with other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who have committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural places such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer appear as adults for possession of small quantities.
The representative of the County Public Prosecutor's Office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all marijuana detention cases without delay.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time applying the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters in Colorado supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and governmental framework for personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials in relation to the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents those accused of marijuana consumption and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent a good part of their lives prosecuting people who consumed marijuana, too, had a hard time accepting that it was legal," he said.
As the first states to treat the restricted consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case of case law for the legalization of drugs.
While state defenders and representatives anticipate a new frontier of legalised sales, they look forward to the federal government's guidelines, which always perceive the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of marijuana lawmaking hope that the Ministry of Justice will pass.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sales, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales to be practiced in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police will probably not break down the doors to seize small drug bags, it is very likely that they will oppose the authorized sales of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even if it was only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and is expected to impose this prohibition next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we are faced with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community's vote rather than in the state's vote.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
Today's students are not the only ones who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was an important place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I settled in Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and began to cry.
My friends were confused.
The newspaper of L'Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university, because I had objected to the fact that students in the first cycle had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson testified factually that I was gone after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been bullied and constantly being bullied.
Not because of my name rather outrageous, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why mention this today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of middle-right students undergo the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as did those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of Corpus Christi College's student room (JCR) said that they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary released on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and of Law") devoted to student politics, which depicted "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
In particular, student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moved to Rolls-Royce, was found to be a complete silver tree and moved with a chromed head cane.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as emigrants for the establishment of higher education costs."
Luke Black, 20, Vice President of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, aged 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the OUCA, said that there was a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are in the center-right.
"It constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one thinking of that during my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, then I was 18 years old and was paralyzed with shyness.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - an old student - an honorary title because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was filled with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the home week, when the new students met the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen later.
I discovered that not only did the teachers participate in sarcasms towards the Tory students, but they also took pleasure in it.
It was as if the policy on juvenile strikers, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was engraved on the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim involved a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a stuttering face, took easy.
"Are the Thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he launched a horny tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then felt a little touch on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
I'm afraid so.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservator) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Torys claim to be Labour (Workers).
Later, at the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted on the fact that I disagreed with everything Mrs. Thatcher had said.
This stratagem failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironically, studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken the break.
I was perverse, you bastard.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I only lead a normal life in Oxford?
Were I forced to meet people who shared the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become a Labour and denied my views?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never here.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started to make the shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded local friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelievable.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he told me pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dream bells.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's about takin' you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent journeys to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a working session conducted the following week, when another history professor suggested the most serious in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
Stirring inwardly in shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and treated them as "crazy old."
The repeat was short-lived.
It was my father who pulled the last nail from my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch’s press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed carpeted in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers left.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can treat me with wet hens.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which produced not only 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian tailor.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-cut models created for his sewing house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his impermissible Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ point of a story whose only protagonist is "lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until 3 March, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocracy cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest tailor of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jetset.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette moustaches on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to our Gstaad chalet," explains former woman of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate friend of the beauty of the past like Marella Agnelli or Eugene Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
Even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also forgotten the charm of the tailor.
Several years ago, after a parade at Place d'Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never become fashionable, because its creations are works of art," she ends.
Nobility line parade
Garavani's life is not a history of obsessions but shared love.
He loves people who are very high and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a 60-metre wide glamorous podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the seat of the mannequins and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" dream bearing Valentino's main creations, like the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to the empire Farah Diba.
Among them are Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "not possible to forget".
I remember perfectly well.
It was a pants, a shirt, a jersey and a vest from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the seamstress's museums.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimes our beauty," added the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and bright.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and Modest Patricia della Giovanpaola of Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red night dress, with a flying skirt, a draped buster and a take-off to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with time," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg retains the evening dress of the tailor with "the greatest care, because a night dress is not only a dress, it is also the whole memory of her vehicle".
The "kings" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during his marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months to work and 25 "ragazze" (the couture so calls its seams) to realize this ivoir silk dress with incrustations of pearls, twelve different kinds of laces and a four and a half meters stretch.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high sewing of the late twentieth century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obnumbrated for years by the "sweetness" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion d'Honneur, Garavani cumulates as many honours as any of his clients' spouses.
"I'm refined, calm, its neat and perfect look always jumped to my eyes," says Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years had no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the wearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and health by carrying 70 kilograms of sulphur through steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by carrying the sulphur of Volcano Kawah Ijen, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the earth's guts solidifies to the contact of the air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh about 70 kilos [70 kilos], he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that reaches 2,386 meters high, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to scale this distance, at a tortoise, by keeping the balance and measuring their steps to avoid stumbling and falling into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their life, as it happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once on the top, he slips a path between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and with pennibly carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers up to the balance that a mining company has set up a bit in contrava at 1,850 meters altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to 10,000 rupees (83 cents euros) to the petrochemical industry as this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten the sugar.
"As we transport about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually travels three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 dollars (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," said the carrier who used to work as a brick on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (€6.20) per day and the job was not as difficult, but then he returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought him back to Java to convert to Islam."
Then he suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, cough constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already started making him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Then he suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, cough constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in English more than acceptable.
Sick of life, this friendly and intelligent young person could be a tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a mule.
He shares an unhealthy wood measure with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur never ceases to melt at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting up with a small lamp attached to his helmet, that he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers carry the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to carriers who work on their behalf and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch a sub of the 30,000 rupees (€2.50) of increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (€1.20), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his three sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick smoke columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... that of course add their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, knee pain and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only charge 50 kilos.
Each day, his companions drew 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse of Tamasari, 18 kilometres from there by a trail of goats invaded by the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik by opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The elder of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the perpetual misery of generation to generation is one of the most difficult trades in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are responsible for this absence of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The people of Singapore must develop".
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from advertising for mint pills, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like a dust drag on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
Words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychin in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to enable people to perform "their national duty".
It is intended solely for the Internet, so we have been able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we felt that this was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we said the following: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take this lightly.
He spends US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was over 2, considered as the renewal rate, was 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says that it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"It has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, beyond marriage and the establishment of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that add barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially towards Chinese people who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore experienced its worst election results last year since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the establishment of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in birth rates has a known impact on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this started to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "footbox", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the EL Developers real estate company, says that his "footboxes" sell much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash.
However, he admitted that the new standards provide clearer guidance to promoters, who were previously put in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
So long as these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the central financial district, it would appear that they do not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that's why people put it back later," says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and my time," says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of access to property and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babymaking, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private sector for under 16 years?
How to apply this definition in daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses by spreading events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriodico interviewed five young boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" with personal and "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private word on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been holding an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I put nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I'm not going to share one of my pictures or someone who would make the fool," he said.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine Twitter subscribers.
Most of them are family.
His mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just put them," he says.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he said.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He won't trust anyone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"That doesn't worry me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made any advances or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we are experiencing today under the name of cyberharbation are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was picked up on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it on to a private profile."
He then explains to us a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post knowledge photos in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I were angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyber-threatening," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, professor of English and laid-off in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet arose as a way to search for information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master in teaching at Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who must teach them there, while we ourselves are learning," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say at an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective, while what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents confidentiality is to use questions that make them reflect.
"They say not to do so is useless," she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others are publishing on you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do it offline.
They're the same rules.
"Internet times, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be similar on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, professor of university, primary teacher and education adviser, states that it is essential for parents to read conscientiously the conditions of use of social networks.
With each of the terms in mind, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to foreigners.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) was concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Ef tried several times to access the document signed at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the end of the summit, and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian Government's website.
When questioned on the text, they reported that its content had been presented by Peru's president, Ollante Humala, in brief press statements.
Access of journalists to summit information has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that was circulating among journalists was given by press officers from some of the Unasur governments that were attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some malaise among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media demanding more important information.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech rather than the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the 3rd Arab South American Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested by the press, it had not also issued the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgement of the Hague Court which splits a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleadings of both parties in the trial that Lima has tried against Santiago and that starts in The Hague on Monday.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we bring before this international court today," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chili has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," added President Piñera, handing over to President Humala, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia had this week denounced the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 project lines had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by developing residence permit agreements".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "co-operation in combating urban insecurity and international organized crime, measures to improve drug accessibility, low-priced Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and see a better future for our populations," said President Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he noted that five were concerned with Peru and were located on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador although it had not given any further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the country's electoral process will allow it to be re-entered into the Union of South American Nations", of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme discussed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgement of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," President Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will call for a discussion with that country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to attend the taking power of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, at the summit, the Ministers of Block Defence will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the VIth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on State television, TV Peru, that Europeans "were engaged in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland".
In this regard, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by the Unasur member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas of reaction that we want to make part of the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President supported the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, on the other hand, we, the South American, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but instead respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at that time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice that demanded him to submit to an interrogation on an alleged sexual offence in his territory while "Swedish law itself allows it to be done by video conference, which could be done since Ecuador's embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian president said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being confined to a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"That's about anybody's health," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Equatorian Embassy of London, which would be the award of a safe haven that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and he stresses that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, as Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón has launched a whole series of procedures with different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted it except by tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation fully permits, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London, or asked him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians, but the bad journalists on the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward its re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to pursue the way and trace the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must stand firm and not tolerate opportunityism and attempts at disguised coup", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to move forward together.
They must be solved as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the good resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it was "beneficial for Latin America to seize international forums if both countries agree to accept such a firm judgement".
With reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to fighting a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although this is sometimes quite difficult."
Correa ensured that, if he lost primarys in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose ourselves, I'll do it too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just discussed with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"That does not mean a relapse of President Chávez's health condition," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today participated in Lima at the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: seropositive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make it "less penniless", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it and his hard work was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit at Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic would avoid saying goodbye "because he was voiceless".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," stated the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he notes that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of assignment of the immune system that patients presented at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach a 500 CD4 rate.
Simply saying, it means that for someone who will receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "while he will remain under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age," said the scientist interviewed.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the Mexican life expectancy is today an average of 76 years.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS Annual Report), but it is also true that, since the emergence of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we have never missed any medication, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already present an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to carry out more early diagnostics and, for this, to offer testing in a massive way, to all those who ask for it."
Specialists and members of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who have had to do their screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and, despite his age, he was already the bearer of AIDS and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I blow up three times a week," they say, "that's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active, but co-responsible sexual life, I care for myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day.
Let them test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, says Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of 100, it is very good, but as a result, even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgements by social workers, guidance advisers, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents don't want to hear, the journalist says.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms be not only sold to counters, but also found in public toilet distributors and in places that young people visit.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a matter of paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had answered when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms to already sexually active people," he said.
Figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in many of the new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th cases for the number of HIV patients.
92% of contamination is sexual, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore HIV.
A judgment ratified in appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of Vitro Group debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario gives rise to a negative precedent for all national corporations with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It would therefore appear that the survival procedures of Mexican companies are not valid in the country on the star banner, at the expense of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the coup brought to the judgment on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will enable Mexico's main glass manufacturer to seize the United States Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must register according to the U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, based in New Orleans, claims that the main proceedings is the formalised business bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for Uniform International Trade Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the inter-corporate vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Faults had secured debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, anyway the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the U.S. courts, i.e. the funds "vautour" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
Data omitted by the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had encountered since 2008 without stopping the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For now, the company of the González Sada family will appeal to the same appeal court to ensure that the vote takes place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
In this case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States will call for non-prosperity and require a review of the trial.
The most serious thing is that the court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the friendly curiae ("friend of the Court") in which Vitro's proceedings under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act were detailed, noting that this would release it from the conventions signed by both countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
He also pointed out that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carabolage of two parts: they take Vitro and they take the country.
General review
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society's trade unions against the former patron of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were silenced for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, the Syndical Association of Aviation Pilots has already encountered problems.
The proceeding, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values that is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has consistently denied providing information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw F/589 from bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase shares from the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're sitting on Dragon Mars.
Meeted at the end of the week in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and civil society members approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the great wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in bringing together the governors of the South-Eastern area to oppose the monumental project that is partly on protected areas and represents the largest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Commercial Agreement, known under its English acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was good that the senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was regarded as an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basket-ball is my whole life"
The “Hetin” Reyes basketball trout has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the field and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage is condemned to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, a national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with the Bayamón Vacaros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I wore several helmets in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his itinerary out of standards, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those he loves most are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vacaros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"That was my best years, the ones I've most benefited from because I had the chance to participate in eight Vacaros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships that were held from 1971 to 1975.
Then I retired at the 1981 championship, the year that Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been leading here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a costly player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That's how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shots.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another one.
He was delighted with the Vaqueros Championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of Mincy's and his duties in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't made us play the last game, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and put a rattle on the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there were also the youth (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but she gave us a gold medal and great joy during the pre-olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hurruitiner in place of players suspended by the Imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Without a doubt, this is Piculin Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculin did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having is part of the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the NSB had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island at national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I have seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field personnel and arbitrators.
This makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), worldwide became known for the main role of John Ross Ewing, best known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a man of business without scrupulously, formidable and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday night of cancer complications, according to a family release sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and later she was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her press associate, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived his life in full," Gray said in a communiqué.
Physicians diagnosed liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and recognized a lot of alcohol for many years.
In 1995, he had been detected with a malignant liver tumor and had suffered from a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary guy in the "Jinny of my dreams" series broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained short on the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema are well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspension around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
As a result, among other things, the series reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most widely watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had brought together 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot her.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened her with prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reason to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unsatisfiable man but with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband trying to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write: "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as of a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each one of us, who had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT chain.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is under way, informed the chain.
For now, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who was famous for classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the stage of New York Theatres in the early 1950s and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and he married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R. Undeservable Memoirs)
"I haven't written anything in this book that can hurt someone or affect him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver graft, he became an active organ donor activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I trust them, I come with them when they come to operate and after," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them a little comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it'll be okay."
He has also been a tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hammock there: the end of the "great count" of the Mayan calendar on 21 December, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what he was expecting in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax guffre that some called the "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of time thought would trigger the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever met," said Professor Charmé this week to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we said it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the Apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last of history.
At the Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker delivered the course "Media, Culture and End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas thrive with time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students need to study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students any choice but to work "until the very night of the end of the supposed world," Restall said.
The courses have turned out to be quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursery, says he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less than one teacher, told us not to believe in the end of the world of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," said Julie Zegle, a senior student in the Temple, aged 21 and originating in West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, this is only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I agree that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back to centuries, which causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
This is mostly an Anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that we were teaching here about "the end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, many of the alleged dates of last judgment have been discussed, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or the philosopher that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us that they thought they were going to parties "of the end of the world."
"I sometimes call friends and we laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
