Members of the Galles Assembly are concerned to "identify them as Muppets"
Several members of the Assembly expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has emerged from the plan to change the Assembly's name for the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a cause for ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "remained with Twp or Pwp".
For non-Galish readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that the set of his party "do not see it with good eyes" and proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh Conservative member said his group was "open" in front of the name change, but he also commented that there is too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is spoken similarly to the letter "u" in English from Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce the names: "The final decision on any qualifier to appoint the members of the assembly will of course fall within the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 grants the Wales Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was set up by "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one that received a wider support in the public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives; however, the attempt to achieve a consensus can lead to a complete misunderstanding for the Assembly President, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will hold the final vote on their name during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in referendum for their country's name
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the "North Macedonia Republic."
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that has lasted for decades with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to be part of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the difficulties of the Harlem churches
"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, none of them are left, both of them."
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he says.
"The bars have already stopped being those kind of living rooms for the neighborhood where people went periodically."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as his leaders predict, "and sooner or later they will return to their place of departure."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he says, "and so what they will do is accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is entirely unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that was originally formed left during the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to retail traders on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they took over the wagon.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to his St. Martin's church, described the trolloon as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who ringed the reel in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also observed that it was the first trolley in the world that was played by a black-breeded musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest trolley in the Church River 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has indeed sounded like in St. Martin's over the last few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them led by secular church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese last July all expressing its concern that the diocese "will transmit costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in contracting the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy while looking for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he was spending half an hour knocking with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help, and then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that first thought it was about the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting 'They bit me!'
I've been bitten!'
He had the whole clavicle ripped off," observed Hammel when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone came out of the water, I cried out, 'There's a shark in the water!'," adds Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was severely indicted.
You don't know what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press release, rescuer Larry Giles commented that I worked a few weeks that had detected a shark in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic wounds in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them do not consider themselves dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to the United Kingdom's beauty products market
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty product corridors in the style of large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large corridors are just part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the United Kingdom, a market that moves about GBP 2800 million and that continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors stay behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more shops next year if the test becomes a success.
Investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of space on their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's claims that it will double its beauty offer to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with areas of brands similar to those that can be found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique make-up products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an increasingly demand for younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions to two stores in Sainsbury's, the first one last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and switching to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made large supermarkets need to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly resemble large stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's been introducing Argos sales outlets to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he said, has served to relaunch the sales of junk and to increase the profitability of procurement.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its departments of beauty products and pharmacy resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's joint operation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but it all came to an early conclusion of not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the drug chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's from their 281 pharmaceutical business in Celesio, owner of LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands for skin products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our beauty products corridors to improve the environment of our customers.
We have invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and to challenge the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby gets behind a deal of 11 million GBP
Dragon's Star Den Peter Jones went away "furicious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby backed off an 11 million GBP deal with Jones' lifestyle business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to engage in the household product business and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrew.
This Morning’s 37 - year - old introducer used Instagram to announce her march.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones infuriated by withdrawing in the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the blonde television star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his empire center in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, which the new presentationer's agreements, worth GBP 1.5 million, meant that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of home products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrew and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When 37 - year - old Willoughby used Instagram to announce his march from Truly, Jones took a private plane heading toward one of his holiday homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
He was destined to be his long - term future, where we would see him for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to go back left without words all the parts involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of goods at its center in Marlow ready to be sold."
According to experts, the march of this Morning's presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions because of the significant investment in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes, and the possibility of delays for her release.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined in office as president last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40 percent of the TV producer in Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source near Jones commented last night that "We won't make any comments about their business."
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticisms he received from the media to make a comment that some would consider to be "little of a president's property" and to have such a positive opinion from the North Korean leader.
Why did you give up Trump so much?
Trump said, mocking the tone of voice of a newscaster:
"I've given up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after June's first meeting in Singapore was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization are stagnant.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong commented on it on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" by the US to the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
However, he observed, the US continues to apply sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump’s point of view, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
And now we're keeping this big relationship."
According to Trump, their efforts to improve relationships with Kim have had positive results: end of missile testing, help to free hostages and return home to remnants of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this compound full of people, we would have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was told to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared necessary to catalyse international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," says Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it's not sure that foreigners can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutope, spokesperson for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute to aid.
Given the constant earthquake in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although in Aceh shelters have been built in the case of a tsunami, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of warning mermaids in the case of a tsunami, although there was a warning in force, it is very likely that it has contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of Indonesian islands is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was raided in Lombok to address the victims of the earthquake is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the new place of disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and he has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, the Joko government is facing next year's re-election loaded with funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
Over 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displacements are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs with bricks, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes the goal of the quastro with a long shot in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with its goal scored at the minute 89 Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea gate when her team was losing 1 to 0.
He settled the ball to the left before he let go an incredible shot directed at the second suit.
The shot crossed the entire area with a big elevation as it propelled itself to the right cross of the gate.
The ball finally started the descent over a full jump Kepa Arrizabalaga to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I only tried to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," says Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanté coming, I made a knock, and I didn't think much, I just got involved in kicking."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at the break after scoreing a goal to 25 by its Belgian star Eden Hazard.
On the move, the leader of the Blue team came back a pass to Mateo Kovacic before he booted from almost the middle of the field and turned to the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
Then he made a magnificent deep pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the controlled ball.
Hazard surpassed the defense to finish the second pole with a stick with the left leg where the doorman of the Liverpool Alisson Becker could not get there.
Liverpool will face Naples at the champion League group phase next Wednesday at 15:00 in St. Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for its part, will play with Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings collapsed because of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to the spokesman of the agency Sutope Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with ruinous buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a stabbing woman
The murder investigation started after the woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several stab wounds on Grayson Mews, John Street; then, a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the locals to see or hear something about the crime before the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statements: "If the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to call everyone near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially to taxi drivers who have been able to get anything through the car's onboard camera, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body they found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have reported that the facts are being reported to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he heard what had happened, he ran out of words.
He's warning residents that they'll be in hours until they can get back in.
He could hear how a police officer told a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
Don't stop repeating "It's awful!".
At 2:00, two police vans were inside the area arranged with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained inside the agreed area controlling the floor block.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously through 0800 555 111 and mention issue 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewrite history"
Its disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban in the purest style of many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "boxy" and an "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster Palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe he would end up sacrificing Cromwell wrong by the actions of his forefather he did during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his obvious case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a completely accurate representation remains a historical subject of debate.
What is true is that the medieval conflict of the 17th century constituted the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated."
A murdering pig wounds a Chinese farmer dead
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and covered with blood near a pig court in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported on Sunday in the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject cows into pigs in a tent in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As you know, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave a yard of neighboring pigs.
He claimed that there was a large male pig in the court with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kilver had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs torn apart and full of blood," said the cousin, named "Wu," as mentioned in the news of Guiyang evening.
The security scene shows how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by either Yuan or his cousin.
One market leader commented on the evening news that the pig was locked and isolated to avoid attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
According to reports, the Yuan family and market officials are negotiating compensation for their death.
Though very rare, cases of pigs that attack humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, and left the man with serious wounds.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig grabbed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "decadent."
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't come up with the idea of harming.
Just give them the respect they deserve," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains all over the Southwest of the United States
According to predictions, hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout North Mexico and Southwest America over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, owned by a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, Eastern US time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving in the east direction to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Next, tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains all over the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The tropical heavy humidity will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
They are expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the south-west, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility of laughter, as the situation is worsening very quickly because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Storms could cause the brook to turn into uncontrollable rivers, and the storms could cause wind and cloud to swell to certain points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at certain points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that total precipitation is recorded over 50 mm, which could cause lower waste streams and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall in the rainy season in the region.
They will begin to arrive isolated tropical rainheads in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread out to the four cornered region on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
October there will be several major temperature oscillations across the United States as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The Central American region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic differences in temperature.
There have been differences of temperature of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will begin with heat in much of the central and eastern US, with temperatures about 27 degrees from the South Plane area to parts of the north-east.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, representing about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures above average in the East of the United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate to Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual schedule of Friday due to a round of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a charge investigation for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, said that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million spectators are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average audience of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The audience figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Besides, Nielsen usually has problems calculating the people he sees from his office.
In perspective, this is a similar audience to that of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders of which clearly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most audienceed channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the testimony of the entire day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS achieved 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's data.
Interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while being rebuked by protesters when he was trying to get up on an elevator to go to a court hearing.
Flake spent several minutes with her eyebrowsed while she was on live TV on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
"You think he's telling the truth in the country?
They told him 'you have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!"
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he commented that he would have more to say in front of the committee.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcast chains were already live retransmitting the time when the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote whether or not it was going ahead with the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate plenary to put it to the vote.
Flake said, however, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the next week's nominee, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations she had with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made her decision.
The choice by Flake had an influence, since it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and scorning national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, May Boris Johnson's former foreign minister reinforced his attack on the so-called Brexit Chequers Plan, which states that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect taxes together is "absolutely absurd".
Killed Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU team player
The police arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year basketball player who was enlisting the U.S.L.U. team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and sent to prison for second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS WAFB's subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted that he died Wayde from a shot, according to the police.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
East Baton Rouge district forensic office released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head towards the neck.
The department thanks the operating group of the Louisiana state police, the state police criminalist lab, the Southern University police and the local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that culminated in this arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his appreciation to the local law enforcement forces for his "deligency and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
About 198 yards, he played the air and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebots to start last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach on the LSU Will Wade team commented that the team is "destructed" and Wayde's death was "a very strong blow."
"Things like this are the ones that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
An ash volcano in Mexico City
The ash spit by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after crater activity was detected and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within a 24-hour period.

Geophysicals have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 rocked the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favour of independence were confronted with the riot police and thousands of people joined in opposing demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of independent individuals held by the riot police started throwing eggs and painting in dust, causing dark clouds of dust in the streets usually invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, violent protesters were subjected to handcuffs with the police, who used their handcuffs to keep violent protesters safe.
For several hours independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face to face with unionist protesters who called "Long Life in Spain".
Fourteen people were subjected to mild injuries during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not diminished in this region of independentist mentality one year after October 1 had a referendum considered illegal for Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence for a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, since the opponents of secession boycotted majority voting.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote by entering the electoral colleges throughout the region, which led to violent clashes.
Independentist groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The protest also took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independentist demonstration together with his wife, said that he no longer had much hope of the possibilities that Catalonia would enjoy independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best times.
I saw my parents crying with joy about voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although by little margin, in the autonomous elections last December, Catalan independence parties have suffered to maintain the campaign this year, since many of their leading leaders are in self-imposed or detained exile awaiting trial for their role in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration of support for the police on his phone, and said that the conflict has been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension only increases," he comments.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce backwardness in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after covering a house with a car
Three men 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly invested against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballenagaard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says they caused damage to the doors and the building itself.
Also, at some point someone may have shot a bullet at the car.
A Menga move gives Livingston victory for 1 to 0 in front of Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingston was to win
Livingston, who had climbed the category this year, surprised Glasgow Rangers in which it is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's game made a difference, since, with this victory, Gary Holt's team goes to second position, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerrard's people, on the other hand, still don't win out of the Premiership this season, and next Sunday they'll face the leader, the Hearts, who separates them from eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid Thursday in the League Europe.
Livingston, meanwhile, expands to six parties his invictive rally to the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston doesn't take his chances in front of the visitor's direct game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scorer long before the goal, since its direct game caused all sorts of problems in Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way between the defense, but he wasted his chance when he met in front of the door, and then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out by lying to try to finish Craig Halkett's head pass, who crossed the door.
It was good for the locals to let Rangers get close to their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble in isolated play.
And that's how this decisive goal came about.
The referee whispered a misunderstanding against Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play it first and finish from the central part of the area.
Until that time, Rangers had dominated possession, but he met with an impenetrable defense and a Liam Kelly porter who had very little work along the party,
The stage was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop doing some credit.
For his part, Ranger Allan McGregor's porter stopped with his feet on an occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up diverting another combination game from Livingston.
Rangers went on to hang up again and again in the Livingston area, just to be rejected, and two criminal charges were claimed, one for a supposed Halkett entrance to replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for hands, both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great performance for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their return to the highest category, although much of the merit must be attributed to Holt for the way the team has galvanized since its arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be hanging for Menga throughout the game.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as a coach, they have definitely failed to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly surpassed the local defense), and that Rangers, who is on the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Assault reception for Erdogan in Cologne
It was all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated because of such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's income in the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police reported security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard while condemning Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of views that is around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled dictator for others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies in a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the street crucible Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, and although paramedical services paid attention to the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident took place months after another cyclist died in a runaway situation at Childers Street, 1.6 km from Saturday's accident site.
The metropolitan police said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest family members.
The street has been cut down and deviations have been applied for bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Wounded in an Dispute · Global Voices
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation in this high-security prison facility, according to the headquarters.
The events occurred in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 09:30 on Sunday, local time, and still remains.
Specialized "returned" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight prisoners were involved.
The officers had to be cared for for by mild wounds in the face of the facts.
According to a prison service spokesman: "We have deployed prison personnel specially trained to try to solve an incident in Long Martin prison, which still remains.
Six employees have had to be cared for with wounds.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, we're clear that those responsible for this dispute will have to report to the police, and they may have to spend even more time in jail."
The Long Lartin prison centre is home to over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was known that the head of the prison had to be served in a hospital after being attacked by a prison.
In addition, in October of last year, anti-valot agents made a statement in prison to resolve a serious dispute in which central staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (drought areas could benefit)
It is not common for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early in the week next when what remains of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert of the south-west, with the consequent risk of laughter.
The national meteorological service has already issued laughing alerts for Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly at Phoenix on Tuesday and to arrive at Monday night with rains.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a tweet that only "two tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression in a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the hurricane national centre provide for 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated spots to record up to 150 mm in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, including Central Rockies and the Great Conca, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated dots up to 100 mm.
For areas at risk of laughing, the dew could become very good news, as the region suffers from severe drought.
Despite the fact that rivers are a serious cause of concern, some precipitation could be very beneficial, since the southwest region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US drought control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will hit land on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have strength of hurricane on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
So he's expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Precipitation in various parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of laughter.
According to weather.com, "they expect 75 to 150 mm of rain from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with a tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona at the first hour of Tuesday morning with a tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach south of Utah well entered Tuesday night.
"The biggest risk we expect from Rosa or what remains of him is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and the Southwestern desert of the United States," according to the national hurricane center.
Rain is expected to cause dangerous rivers and streams of waste in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy has been found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with wounds at the Midsome Norton High Terrace area, about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he's stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have called for anyone who can have some sort of record of the facts on the mobile phone to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "suffered the Messiness and Wrath" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejection of the ruthless and outraged tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "patished the pettyity and anger" of the Democratic party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh declared in front of Congress Thursday, firmly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual abuse of her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in relation to his associate.
The president said on Saturday that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and bravery."
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable journey of service to citizenship," he commented to the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the rate of participation of Republican voters in the elections in the middle of the mandate.
"We're five weeks from some of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn't run, but actually I did," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing".
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place as late Friday, according to CNN, an assistant to the leaders of the Republican party.
Hundreds of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches because of a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday because of a festival held on the beach in the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters impacted the coast toward the evening, dragging many people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and they didn't run right away, so they became victims," said Sutope Purwo Nugroho, spoke to BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, smashed everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting on the coast.
Some people climbed a tree running from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency that appreciate the amount of shops and destroyed buildings, turning bridges and collapses and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to rock this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes series were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the intense Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
According to the agency, the geographic features of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Domanga, nearest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information was available" from Domanga, says Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which could unfortunately end much worse," he says.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a amateur shared on social networks, you can feel like a man located on the top floor of a building gives desperate warnings to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water burst out on the shore of the sea, taking buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not authenticate the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in the power supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say that evacuaters continue to desperately need food, as well as other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although workers from World Vision in Domanga were able to get safely and safely to the city of Palu, where employees are housed in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba says.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although the relief groups did the despondent gesture of initiating relief efforts, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, provision and staffing of foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While I was spending the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing people kept the hope that the miracle and their loved ones would escape the desolate story of natural disasters.
Saturday, a child was rescued trapped in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Besides Mr. Mandagei, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding area, I have my own emotional burden," he pointed out.
Gendon explained that, within hours of the fact that he circulated the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel between the parapentist community, he had desperately sent messages by WhatsApp to the Palu competitors participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a double blue mark.
“I think that means the messages were not received,” he added.
A thief takes $26,750 during the filling of an automatic cashier in Newport where the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an automatic cashier in Newport where the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport police department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy pointed out in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM to the entertainment complex and was preparing it for more money.
While doing his job, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a money bag for distribution.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper is renamed to Ye
The Kanye West rapper is renamed Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
He used that alias as his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before it appears in the program Saturday Night Live, in which it is expected to present its new album, entitled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
Besides being an abbreviation for his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio host.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I've passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confusing part, everything.
The album is more a reflection than we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers that have been renamed.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West collaborator, has been worth his nickname with or without a script and in capital letters.
Mexico's President, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has never promised to use the military force against civilians, when there is little time for the country to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a cruel reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "the military force would never again be used to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people at a time when student movements on the left were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
he said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funds allocated to AI
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money it spends on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional specialized in artificial intelligence that it has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrive after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures in the field of IA, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in IA in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become number one in the world as regards innovation in AI in 2030.
"Dupplicating the research budget in AI would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next IA field advancement," said Lee.
"Dupplicating funding could double the opportunities that the United States will achieve the next major discovery in AI," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading IP companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an IA system that passed the American Othello player with the best ranking and later served as executive in Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively appreciated previous technological competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge from the Advanced Defense Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain public scholarships," said Lee.
According to Lee, "China doesn't take academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have contracted university eminence to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the U.S. work in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think permanent residency cards should be automatically offered to doctors at AI," he added.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China presented its latest-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way as the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other public bodies in the United States give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China," said Lee.
At the beginning of the year, the United States Department of Defence created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industrial collaborators and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA has announced an investment of 2,000 million USD in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Science Foundation, currently spends over 100 million USD a year on research at AI.
In the meantime, for months, no measures have been applied in relation to the American legislation which sought to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide whether to change their country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a complaint from its territory and has denied entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign doubts whether there will be at least 50 per cent needed participation to ensure that the referendum is valid.
The question set out in the referendum paper is: "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU, with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Name-change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that was created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the realm of the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that it will determine the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, Parliament needs a two-thirds majority.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there was no irregularity at 13 o'clock.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the change of name of the country, which would open the way for accession to the Union of Europe and NATO to Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of tents installed by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick with our heads high, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO membership will be accompanied by investments more than necessary in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the great majority will vote in favour of it, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev stated that a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research in Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another survey, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV station, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote 'yes'.
For referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first time hard for the policy of the pro-Western government since it took over the month of May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero from Manchester City makes a goal after he's scratching the entire Brighton defense.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory for 2 to 0 in the party at Etihad Stadium last Saturday, Manchester, England.
Agüero scored a goal at minute 65 in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine leader received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He left at a speed between three Brighton defenses, scratching with what he was walking through the playing field.
Then Agüero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He scrambled a defense before he passed a few more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he made a pass to his left that found Sterling.
The English leader returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, who with the right leg beat the doorman of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a kick that crashed inside the network on the right side.
"Agüero has problems on his feet," Pep Guardiola, coach of the City, told the journalists.
"We decided I'd play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that you have scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling that gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that move, Agüero received the ball in depth in the field of Brighton and
He made a beautiful pass in space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before he passed it to Sterling on the long pole.
The Sky Blues leader finished the ball inside the network before he left the background line.
The City faces Hoffenheim on Tuesday part of the Champions League group phase at 6:55 p.m. in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off struggle, there were not many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to get out at the launch monticle on Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who keep an advantage game about Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have a chance to play the play-off.
The Rockies assured themselves of a victory for 5 to 2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still seek their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, we can at least go out and throw out knowing the atmosphere here, in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably be arguing every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this party?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening launcher for Sunday, but apparently they're determined to let Scherzer throw if this situation happens.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a warm-up session on Thursday and would launch on Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-wing launcher has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strips eliminated at 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump meets West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the environment of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big ones.. I don't introduce myself, but actually I do. That's why I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all necessary means, they see their pettyness, their evil intent.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The mission of Democrats, he said, is to "resist and obstruct".
“And this can be seen in the last four days,” he rebuffed, and he called the Democrats “enraged, petty, dirty and false.”
Trump mentioned Diane Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic Senator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, which provoked a loud public shout.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Wait a minute... this was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has stopped being a different party.
He's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of British MPs to whom we've been told we're not welcome, all to say what we think.
My colleague, John Ryan, received a similar treatment because he manifested himself firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, and ironically, these are similar issues as to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the wake of the Nottingham Labour Party meeting on Friday, it was reported that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and it has long forgotten the promise of "generous and kinder" policies, if ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since colleagues with whom he once thought he shared a similar political vision expected me to make a 180 degrees turn and take positions he would never have taken, either on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, for central policies are denounced, and I'm told it shouldn't be the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues that every day they have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they don't "drain."
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with each motion of "untrustful" or every change in the rules of selection, the party gets further stressed.
Over the last two years, I have received a lot of advice and I have been advised to keep my head down, not so expressive and "it would be all right."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by Thatcher's negligent government, which left my whole class literally sunk, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it, either as local advisor or as government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt in any way my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is walking towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But, actually, the message I want to convey is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or no political interest will prevent me from acting, according to my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Some Ayr beaten lead the lead
Two last-minute essays distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved victory in this vibrant party of Tenent's Premiership day.
The Ayrs, who are the only team of the ten, occupy the first position at the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that it was able to take better advantage of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The games we've played so far have tested us and we're still stuck, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: "Congratulation for the Ayrs has taken better chances than we have."
Grant Anderson's essay at minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, stood before the Ayrs, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, handed over to the party by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot recorded a non-converted essay.
Climamo expanded the advantage of the Ayrs with a penalty and, just in the middle, noted and turned a test to put the 17-5 score in favor of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melroses started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted to Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Later, the party was interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which retreated into the bunk, and on the scene the Ayrs re-enlarged the distance with a Stafford McDowall rehearsal converted by Clima.
Next, Captain Blair Macpherson was warned with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw yellow card to make a plating on Climo without a ball, from the sanctions alignment, MacPherson noted a counter-assay behind the penetrating spring of the Ayrs.
Climamo marked, as he had done almost since the retaliatory, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot of David Armstrong and passed the ball on to Gregor Henry's third line to record the fifth attempt of the local team.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to move into the hotel sector after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis' character in BBC's popular series, writing and co-protagonizing with Greg Hemphil, his comic partner for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on it, although a source of the newspaper The Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "florent restoration sector".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without the coast, hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their ship covered with yards in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazons are enlivened with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering him is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia's landless territory, the memory of a lost coastline in front of Chile in a conflict of cruel resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as it is the desire to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, not to say, awaits with a positive stance the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the resolution of the TIJ on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will rule in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign departure to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has many hopes placed on Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court would decide in favor of Bolivia and that if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations organization based in the Netherlands does not have the power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The resolution of the TIJ, which takes place only six months after the final allegations were presented, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a retreat in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
"The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has touched any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after this episode.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally fast.
Next Monday Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of discrepancy, with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless I can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
The Minister urged the United States to keep the promises made at a Singapore summit among the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it seems that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume the stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a chimera who thinks that US sanctions and objections to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean War can never get North Korea to kneel.
Washington hesitates to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament movements before.
Both Kim and the president. American Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang taking seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers to be the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of large hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented to the gateway a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which illuminated the style defined on Paris Fashion Week.
This summer the Instagram has been rocked by very impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's outstanding piece was an exaggerated kiss hat, adorned with a broad wing, with a feather shape, which flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jewelry belts, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of living colors, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high seams.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another seemed like an ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The large-sized hats climb the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat, with a two-foot wide wing, which everyone has carried, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult tag behind the hat so impractical that it spread through social networks brought another great creation to the gateway: a bag of straw for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed with bathrobe that carried it.
The bag of raffia, dark orange, adorned with raffia saws and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the collection The SS19 River of Jacquemus on Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a pity that the demand for large accessories was ignored.
John Edward: Language Skills Are Essential to World Citizens · Global Voices
Independent Schools in Scotland maintain a course of academic excellence that continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide a top level service to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a matter of very popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, you’ll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the year's exams, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages got A-higher.
The data, collected from 74 schools members of the CIS, reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also received an A.
This proves that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are maintained in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills revealed that the reasons why entrepreneurs gave them the cost of covering their vacancies, 17% were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are increasing opportunities for potential work that require languages, these powers are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competency like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, and French, with 15% speaking, was the only language with a double digit.
That's why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Knowing different languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important jobs.
In Scotland there is diversity among schools as to the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom towards the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest is, he'll always be able to choose between a number of languages in the independent schools, who have teaching staff specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what lies ahead.
In the global trading environment of the present day, it cannot be denied that languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communicative competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
We have to do this.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent School Council
LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is practically over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-timed game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes you're going to play.
"They'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the Lakers' official location.
Mike Trudell, a Laker journalist, tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-party calendar of the Lakers.
“I don’t need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first five scheduled meetings for the next week, including visits to friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for her candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 a.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's West Virginia rally can be seen online at the link specified below, via YouTube live video transmission.
Trump is likely to address the hearing initiated this week with the candidate nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of the allegations of sexual abuse that he is facing, while the Senate's pre-confirmation vote is still pending until one week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this rallying wave is to help Republicans present at the delicate November elections to gain momentum.
So, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for the next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congrès control is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, while we are heading for a season of campaign caught,” said a Trump spokesperson who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could gather supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him impetus in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist of West Virginia University, Reuters said.
Ryder Cup 2018: The American team shows its ambition to keep the hopes of individual Sunday parties alive
After three uneven sessions, Saturday afternoon ants were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamic is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on what side is the positive dynamic now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're on a little positive boost," Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points in front, with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the shape state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and is setting an example.
The gourd screams of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his turn and put a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game in hole 15 with a similar scream, of the kind that indicates that he believes that the American team is not yet out of competition.
"You have to try your best and worry about your own party," Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple bring four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the bountiful public, it is reaffirmed that they are players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is set on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at once in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning furballs, who paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes plunged Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never had a chance to get out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and ants are very fascinating to see for the interactions between matings, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change suddenly.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this ant session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe reaches the end of the Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a victory of 10 to 6 over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave their record, so far, four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophy that he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that was uncertain about the fourballs in the morning and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the ants and won two parties, but they couldn't reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points on the 12 individual Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to get four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple who earn four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the furballs, they called a brilliant action to beat a deflate Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself into two games on Saturday, showed sparks of sporadic genius, but has lost 19 out of 29 games in fourballs and ants, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, rejoined Henrik Stenson in the ants and fell for 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe didn't have everything in its face on a pleasant and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times tournament champions, and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for Americans on Saturday by achieving two points.
They won a victory with determination for 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter at the fourballs and later won back Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4 to 3 in the ants, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team had returned a difference of four points to individual parties, although Furyk's team, a title defender, only needs to draw to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack coming on Sunday is out of range.
North Korea declares that it will not unilaterally disarm "in any way" if no signs of trust are appreciated
North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying their mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong told the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test centre and committing itself to not proliferating nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not observe any response in United States consonance," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally in any way."
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-phase denuclearisation approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps gradually, its statements seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral full-scale denuclearisation, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised security assurances for North Korea.
North Korea has tried to formally put an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang must once eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington must also resist the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearization should first take place and increase the pressure level with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "declaration of the end of war," Ri pointed out.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our mistrust."
Ri did not refer to the plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this situation of shock."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from what he held last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that aiming at North Korean missile territory was inevitable after Mr. Evil's President Trump's Kim of "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
Last year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage to take disarmament measures, but stated that much remains to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time limit for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously launched sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in a bet to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompey met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying they had made progress, but within a few hours North Korea accused him of "demanding a gangster's own."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States took “consonance measures”.
He said that Kim had told him that the "consonance measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing culture of studying all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar observed that students at the world's number one university are often dismissed for what goes to basic aspects about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after making a talk about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, "Why do they tell me now, all this, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” reported The Telegraph newspaper.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, said that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students were deprived of severe sleep during the week.
The course, one hour duration, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, dolls and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects sports performance to lack sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and he added that modern technology and growing pressure that students suffer makes sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Making sure to enjoy a good quality sleep for enough time should be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety, added, even to avoid getting weighty, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in ininsanity mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied Chemistry and Physics Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to carry out a similar curriculum of studies before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to bed and wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of circa-day rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home which is another hit outside.
Ibox's set sought to add his first home victory from the triumph of last February 4 to 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team drifting, at 8 points from Hearts, unstoppable leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half, and it never seemed that Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to match the score.
While Rangers now fall into the sixth place, Livingston rises to third position, behind Winterfell for differences in goals.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object that apparently got thrown from the desk.
Gerrard made eight changes to the alignment that the Ayrs swept into the semi-finals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same 11 headline that took a point against the Hearts last week.
Although the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have marked the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder fought astray and missed the big occasion.
A hard-on launch of Keaghan Jacobs met with Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow only made a quick deviation to the back pole.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than they had in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a 15-minute criminal signal, since he and Steven Lawless met, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only drove two shots to the door the first part, but the first porter of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head hit and the docile front Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi may have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only because of their efforts.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs’s labor.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard acted at the pause when he changed Coulibaly by Ryan Kent. The change had an impact almost immediately, as the end of it made a pass at Morelos, although the imponent Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture visitors' attention by playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band might have yielded the direction to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Litthgow made a quick deviation from the corner.
Ranger replacement Glenn Middleton still demanded a last criminal for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again made his eyes big.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that finally gave rise to the device we know as "Geiger accountant."
Count Geiger, who is a pillar of science since then, also became a pile of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", featured by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, some apparently failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What day is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can listen to the effects of atoms that emanate from radioactivity to minerals."
Evans: "You sure it's breaking up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and remove malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize is malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting a patient's immune cells and altering them in the lab.
You can "see" a common protein in many cancers and then re-inject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer that suffered for more than 18 months disappeared.
The method involves extracting a patient's immune cells, altering them in the lab to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and subsequently re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results that we have obtained suggest we have a promising vaccine."
Her2 protein "protein favors the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells like treating cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West snuggled on a pro-Trump diarium with a MAGA hat after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was drafted during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic action that congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would be presented for the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, he began to criticize Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
"I always talk to white people, they say, how can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody by Matt Damon, where Hollywood's star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate Judicial Committee for allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though he didn't show up, comedian Chris Rock posted West's disapproval on social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West complained to the public that he was not well treated in the backrest because of the hat he was wearing.
"They threatened me in the backyards.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said that Superman's coat would be put on so they couldn't tell him what to do." "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked the public's screams at least twice, and the members of the program team seemed ashamed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who told the publication: "The entire study was completely silent."
West became the last hour substitute for Ariana Grande, the former one of whom the Mac Miller rapper had died a few days ago.
West left much of the public perplexed by the interpretation of Perrier's song and Love It, disguised as a bottle.
West got support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: thank you for getting rid of the crowd."
But the presentationer of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "who he is and who he is absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (including his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I think adopts and disseminates an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "the former being known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Her colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, used to be called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music changed his name to a symbol and later the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after the murder of a man Friday in eastern Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of First Instance in Belfast on Monday.
The D.A. will review the charges.
Game of Throne Star, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of swordsman Jon Snow in the series of violent medieval fantasy of HBO Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of virile hero, claiming that these papers make it clear that young boys often think they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said that he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, has admitted that she has strong determination to deal with this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we now experience?"
According to Kit, television can be a part of the responsibility of increasing toxic masculinity due to its viral characters.
He added, "What is born and what is acquired?
What does it teach on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they should have this facet of manhood?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because there's definitely something wrong with the young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequel or sequel to the Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he's full of battles and horses.
As of November, Kit will play a replay of Sam Shepard's true West work, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his partner Rose is the best game he's ever given him.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life forward," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character representing Kit, Jon Snow, in an Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple entered their marriage in June 2018 at the family farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases by 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officers.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were 40,000 new cases reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who hire HIV for this cause has fallen to almost zero, according to Chinese health officers' statements at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of the LGBT collective is common.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have homosexual intercourse will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to lack of adequate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered data from Republican Party senators and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that requests prompted criticism and far-right websites.
"Mention, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and someone unknown published it in the Capitol during a Senate commission session on sexual abuse complaints against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative locations, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and revealed the information of a Waters staff member, denounced the Capitol.
"This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which they have been compromised by these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this filtration of information.
This groundless denunciation is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," wrote Fleischer.
"That makes you think you don't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he won't get angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the defendant's motives.
He must keep calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was presenting to overthrow Waters in the elections in the middle of the legislature, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Importing if true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent statements.
"We'll make sure the criminals wake up," he continued, "and they'll be legally held responsible for all the actions they've carried out and they've harmed each and every member of my staff."
Johnny's Criticism English Strikes Again: limited spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It's tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new movie with a British approach, and this replay of Johnny English's parody of action- comedy, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Is this humorous self-satire about how despicable we are going to be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the incompetent look and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to twist everything. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comical creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with tradition of going to the cinema.
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who gives a single note to the topic of Fire Cars at the inaugural ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
Originally, he was based on Atkinson's mysterious international traveler who represented Barclaycard's now forgotten TV ads, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There's a good time or two in this last JE trip.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller's leaves tipped him in the helmet.
S"sees the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems pretty low and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Can now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems destined for children rather than adults and for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as clever or focused as Mr. Bean's dumb gags representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the dismay of the service agent, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers from a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this stamped character of Teresa-May, but the script does not get any more.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as every active spy gets in danger, he'll have to get some retirement.
And this includes the misdeed Johnny English, now employed as a professor in some luxury institution, but giving out-of-office classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall by an emergency meeting with his Bough-dry sufferer, a role that re-presents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little out of use.
So the Batman and the Robin of when things get really ugly at Her Majesty's secret service come into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the technological billionaire charismatic that claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: disguised as waiters, burning a French fast-eating restaurant, sowing chaos by smuggling on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the inside of the Volta house.
All the parades are certainly extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, everything looks like a child program.
Pretty normal stuff.
As with Johnny English's other films, it wasn't helpful to think if the film industry gave Rowan Atkinson a role that would bring justice to his talent.
Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to have a four-day workweek and cover five of them.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business leaders to spend the savings achieved by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by giving them a day's more party.
Employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but they get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit into the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The four-day shift to one week's work is supported by trade union confederation Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labour Party declared to The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits the party's perspective of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: "A four-day workweek is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
The shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The Minister's shadow plans also imply that water companies shareholders might not recover the entire investment, since the Labour Government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees in companies' joint ventures and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector firm shares to employees, who expect to borrow annual dividends for up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the investigation of Kavanaugh by the FBI could make them change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment for the Supreme Court at least one week, and has raised the question as to whether the Agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, the correspondent for the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that made them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean it," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He was firm, determined, and secure."
But Graham's vote seems to be recorded on fire.
"I have my opinion of Brett Kavanaugh and would present an explosive charge," he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it," I added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I name will be able to verify.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has he done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive program of stars, which carry out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defense group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help actively combat it.
To receive a free entry for the event (unless anyone wanted to pay a VIP entry), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to awaken consciousness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen achieved now that it takes 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just a case more than we call "lectivism" (a staff member who thinks it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, who have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than 37,000 million dollars, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10,000 million has already been paid off or raised.
The group estimates that currently protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the foundation The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and realists with their own in the United Kingdom, which commits to "help children grow as much as possible" and promises to send to Rwanda USD 35 million to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a bit of a page in history," said Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on her website that asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied, "It's going to be a long, hard way, sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights defense movements and against the previous apartheid, we will succeed, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will be performing at the New York Year's Event, who will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington may, "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting the markets, including those in the Middle East, reveal U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that Russia's intervention in Syria, primarily where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the marine routes are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent their energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event celebrated by Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the "energy consumer's view" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are actually equal.
"Economic choice in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, indicating that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says, turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which cost $11,000 million and will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110,000 million cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy can't be a pressure tool and that consumers have to be able to choose suppliers, declared Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow on September.
The US position has led to a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, the Federation of German Industries, has called on the US to separate energy policy from the EU and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said she would "think carefully" her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she would "think carefully" her candidacy for the presidency after the election of the middle legislature.
At a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, for women to hold high positions," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll take my candidacy seriously as president."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction."
"I am frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticisms of Trump and his High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters believed that it should not be submitted by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said the senator should not be presented, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed a broader support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in relation to a possible candidacy for 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator for Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes TEPT Track Palin's hit at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after listing September 11, 2007
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"With what's happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families who suffer from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds with which our soldiers return," he told the public at a rally by Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans: "they return a little different, they become hardened, they ask again whether there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged for domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and gun tenure under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge to a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
18-state representatives and the district presented a friendly curiae Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the application for the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal politics has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" attacked her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generates a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Karl Racine, declared Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum applications to be granted on the basis of facts and particular circumstances of demand, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the friend curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies entry of immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "proportion of necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims than to flee domestic violence and gangs.
"Asyil is available to those people who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions at their 11th June announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never tried to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts on the Palu as human losses multiply in a spirit to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is becoming more and more desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her child with fever in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There's no drinking water."
Residents have been seen going back to their destroyed houses to take in flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who have broken their shoulders, are outside the Palu military hospital, as patients are being treated outside because of the heavy shaking they repeat.
The tears turned him down as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassing "propaganda ads."
A week after an official Chinese publication posted a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump went to China Daily's payment supplement on Wednesday to The Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of joining the US Congress elections on November 6, USA, an accusation that China is denying.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify the pressure on China.
Although it's normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has seen the spiders push into mutual imports.
China's vindictive tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion paper on The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's redoubled harassment with advertising advertisements published in our free press."
"By disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to insert a payment announcement into The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, at the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you'll find few conflicting voices and you won't see any real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese citizens can have on China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China avoided the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans belong to women voters before the elections of the middle legislature with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
Since many of the major Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces various sexual assault applications, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming elections in the medium term.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already officially show that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, in The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to carry out an FBI investigation is sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants shouted "November is coming!" (November is approaching) as they manifested themselves in the Senate lobby as Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Ms. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be out of the picture," explains Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst independent of the news site.
"People say they've been tall; it's true.
But they could have been more, especially among women voters of suburban women and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote until they like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, where he detailed his claims for sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that there could be a negative response if Republicans pressed with confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, representative of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the board or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh sits at the accused's bank. It's also about how Republicans have managed this issue and how they treated it," pointed out Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps pick Democrats, on the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and the witnesses of Kavanaugh, with the scale that leans slightly towards the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in the Ford's testimony in an unquestionable or probable way, while 35 percent claim to believe in the Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or been in doubt during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the applications filed by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez complained that the Supreme Court candidate taught him genitals at a party while they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intention of Inrupt was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," said the emerging company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is excluded from the personal data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal power through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company integrates appropriate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of GM’s Winning Cross Clerk
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honour.
His two grandsons unleashed a memorial tombstone at a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was present exactly 100 years after his grandfather's guardianship.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns."
Later he ran to the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" made the row advance before throwing himself on a cannon with one hand and leaving three members astonished.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a prosa that could never match, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is shown by support that will be received by many people.
The MMA fans who fell asleep all night watching Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying awake all night to see Bellator 206 and refusing to see the most important event.
San José's poster contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and they had to be seen live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for the fight, the United Kingdom spectators were surprised when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disturbed about how they were to stay all night until the early morning hours of the fight.
One Twitter follower described the shift for cartoons as "a kind of vomitous joke."
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Marketing and Communication of Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the piggy, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include United Kingdom viewers in the future.
"I think when I think of repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there are six a.m. on Sunday mornings and we can't solve it till Sundays at our hours, Mondays at theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were a lot of messages going and coming, and they weren't all nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six like we normally do, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it ended.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims he has grown up feeling inferior to other people because of his sexuality, but that this gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the Desert Island Radio 4 Discs program, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father had played a key role in winning the Olympics.
The usual feature presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months of sick leave.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck in Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "he wasn't socially acceptable like children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me power and strength to succeed."
I wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The twice winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image in Australia's Commonwealth Games this year to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's triampion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American director, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "took me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 bigger than him, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you pass so when you are young (he participated in his early Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone as old as he experienced tall and low alike.
The couple were parents in a child's June named Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, "all their perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me about it last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be just like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept the death penalty, and one of the last things he asked for was if they had all the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you," "father, you won't be there to occupy the first row," she said.
"While he was holding his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that he was already dead, that I finally agreed he wasn't invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in Olympics.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud of Heather Small), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympics and which he still wore his chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is released to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A Mickelson aggravated introduced himself to Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical condition if he doesn't want to become a unhappy ribbon.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as has usually been for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments spends his time between making an ammo and working in his game in the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rush usually punishes the diverted strokes.
And if his own trajectory is not discouraging enough, Miccelson, on the ninth Sunday game, will face the very precise champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the beginning of the 12 individual parties, they start strong, the Miccelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He understood his role perfectly for that day, made me a slap on my back and surrounded me with his arm while he told me he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
"You have a lot of self-confidence.
It's a Hall of Fame and it has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I figured more, but that's how I trained, and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Miccelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a race to the Ryder Cup that hasn't equalized its individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought in intangibles on the team.
"It's fun, sarcasm, joke, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great teammate," he said.
"I think younger players also had fun messing with him this week, which has been fun seeing.
He's bringing a lot more than his game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that starting with considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team headed by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they won the win for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"We kept remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but shortly," Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the 2018 team's victory for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, leaving the score in 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members that is not finished yet.
Tomorrow she has to go to every machine.
You have to go out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the points get to the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I said, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also remember who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Enchanted with the performance of their players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to pass on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this moment, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself."
Opposing Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to surrender better individually than on team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the payouts of the last day, since he was part of the winning team on Brookline before he ended up losing in the "Miracle of Medina" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important parties, but we want to start with good foot, as seen in Brookline and Medina.
When there is a team that is inspired, there is a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We have prepared alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to start the rise against Rory McIllroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I've chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," Bjorn says about his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Army should have ended in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it won't, at least, be done until next year after defective systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The finalization of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Army commissioned in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technology against stolen actions, such as a small radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods of maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the advance ships, which were expected to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they enter into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was already reported last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to Drashana Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons why it has been returned, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, since about 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
Besides, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Army's ability to add future improvements.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz will weigh twice as many class ships as used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from faulty materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached some amazing 3.100 million euros (3,600 million dollars) from an initial budget of 2,200 million euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, taking into account recent warnings that indicate that the maritime military power of Germany is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Army "is running out of ships that can be used."
The officer said the situation has worsened over time because they stopped using old ships, but no new ones were provided as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Armada.
The National Foundation is spying on the secret life of the bats
A new research carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to find out how the bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
It is hoped that discoveries will provide new data on the behaviour of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be soprano and common, plus northern and water bats in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to monitor the activities of the bats during the station.
Volunteers and staff from the United Kingdom National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed picture on the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor to the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are more important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management jobs, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Construction and restoration of buildings threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and ignition are also at risk, just like the killer paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, the bats aren't blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to place insects and obstacles in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the bats very seriously.
He has ten experts with appropriate training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescues in a regular way.
Even the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to bats on the land of Thrave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
Farm manager David Thompson says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a great area for the bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still don't know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand better what they need to grow."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are bats before performing property maintenance tasks, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scottish Foundation for the Conservation of Ratpenates, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data about their population."
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape while his lawyers file a complaint against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has pointed out that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and said people "want to be famous" by his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal's leader and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Allegedly, he paid at the time of $375,000 because the incident was not made public, according to the information published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a 33-year-old video of Instagram Live addressing its 142 million followers after the charges were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five-time winner of the Gold Pilot in the camera.
"They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I am a happy man and everything is in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have described as "inadmissible information of suspicions about private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damage due to an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her anally, according to the reports filed in the county court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayora claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except for a "1%".
The papers allege that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sexual relations, but they were allowed to do so.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later she accepted an agreement outside the courts because she was "for reprisals" and worried "to be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the deal, since she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to fix for King Madrid coming from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he was posted for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "always regret" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "always regret it," if it lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worry" that the Toyota base in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in case of an unagreed Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without agreement on how trade with other EU countries will work has aroused the fears of other United Kingdom car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims that it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in case of Brexit with no agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on a "just time" base, with pieces arriving every 37 minutes from UK providers and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances on the border, which the sector believes could generate delays and scarcity of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and should stop production as a consequence.
Clark states that Theresa May's Chequers' plan for future relations with the EU is "heavyly balanced to avoid these border controls."
We want to get the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," the BBC Radio 4 program said.
"Toyota's evidence not only, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota couldn't confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run, it warned that added costs would reduce plant competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the Union on the plant, said that members begin to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's long-awaited meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "possessing a week" while continuing the fight about the appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and aid to Trump and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fired the Deputy Attorney General and put Mueller's independence at risk, he's been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of filing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors he was about to resign.
On Thursday, however, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate's judicial committee that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into charges against Kavanaugh by the FBI, which further delayed the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied the following: "No date has yet been fixed, it could be this week, although it may be that it will delay one more week for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may object: Sanders has not held any briefings on the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions wasn't because he didn't like the fangy of television journalists, though he said, "I won't deny that they're fans."
He then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any sources: "We have consulted this data."
Sanders said that the briefing sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the possibility to ask the president of the United States directly, it is far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the briefing sessions when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with dignitaries on an official visit.
Individual press wheels are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at some points, strange in front of the journalists gathered.
The Secretary of Health writes to the EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service following fears for Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the release of the EU's United Kingdom.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of state residency applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems to be geared towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations for a possible unagreed scenario.
I know it's time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care, while benefiting patients and communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers rally has undergone an emergency operation after a head injury on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, from Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before half.
"He came to the band line and collapsed there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him in a litter and taking him away to test him more.
A Tennessee State officer informed Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type or extent of injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second-year-old, with Tennessee State after setting it from Illinois.
I had completed five plaques on Saturday before I left the game, which make a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom with additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The list hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
It is expected that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's move to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher yields.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taxed on those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be used for government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
The list expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
13% of London's new construction properties are estimated to be non-British residents, which increase prices and make it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many bountiful areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" from the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the great constructs of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the contributions on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on renting and finishing "free of guilt".
He also wants to give the assembly more power to build new homes.
May said the following: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can't be right that it's just as easy for people who don't live in the United Kingdom, as well as for businesses with them abroad, to buy housing compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home is too distant and the dignity of people without a home makes everything even more real."
Jack Ross: "My ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotch has accepted the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently holds third position in the League One, three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren returned to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as a supporter, and that's all," Ross said to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound program.
"But I grew up seeing much playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was little and it's always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I'm successful in training clubs, but."
Ross's predecessors in Sunderland's coaching include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former coach claims that he does not feel the pressure to be the next on a list of names consecrated on such a large team, after having previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's offers.
"For now, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it's obvious that its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd only consider myself successful here if I can get the club back."
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical body.
He helped Alloa avoid falling into the third category and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to champions of the Championship next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Probably it was a decisive moment," he remembered about taking charge of the Halloa.
"I had always thought training was what was best given me, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I got out of it reasonably and enjoyed quite good moments.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot you have to overcome every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've heard of myself since I'm a grown man."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has fired consumption at Britain's hard-boggling bars, but has added more pressure to restaurants chains.
Bars and bar chains have increased by 2.7% in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA financial adviser, the company that has collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has been longer than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to that of June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption at June restaurants has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have achieved the best results, while the consumption at restaurants has gone down.
The bars offering food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
At the bars and taverns we consulted, the sales of drinks have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the OIC analysts and RSM hotels, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events continue to be the main factors related to sales in the foreign market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% per annum would be especially harmful, rather than the continuing pressure on costs.
This long and warm summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-serving businesses and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide this much-needed breath."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, has been 2.7% in July, as it indicates the momentum in the brand presentation.
The sales indicator of The Coffer Peach Tracker for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the established reference point of the sector.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey
A poll of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "false Insta" pages.
News has raised fears about publishing sexual content
20% of students say they have a "primary" account that shows parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, believe in social networks that hide adults.
A poll of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in the "false Insta" accounts, an Instagram reference, the photo sharing site.
The news has raised fears about publishing sexual content.
About 20% of students say they have a "primary" net account that shows their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager urging others to "violate me."
The investigation, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Private School Steering Committee (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of teenagers between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, half of which have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vives of athletes" in the Scottish athletic federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Federation of Athletics at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is the most medal-winning field and track athlete in Scotland and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from his dilated international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has respect for the Scotch Athletic community, the United Kingdom and all over the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm looking forward to acting as a voice for athletes and I hope to grow sports and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won the gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympics and currently a BBC usual commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote the following on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me whether I can recover or what degree.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's agility practice!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An ad that compares mothers with cows divides their opinion on the Internet
A garbage company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares expectant mothers to mingle cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered to be the "first silent tidallet that can be carried from the world," the technology company for the consumer Elvie has released an advertisement inspired by a music video of jokes to show the freedom that the new tirallet gives to the mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hardware and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I'm dying to myself, but you won't see any tails" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not braguers, but my breasts."
The tour continues: "Bomb, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, water girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim to show the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after birth," wrote one person.
Elvie tirallet is hidden discreetly in a lactation bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented the following: "Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a tidallet for mothers who will preserve their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an off-site advertisement."
Other people defended the advertisement; one woman admitted that finding that the song was "funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the trailer made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It's a great product," wrote one user.
Another person commented the following: "It's a fun announcement for mothers who bomb with darts (usually at their place of work or in the toilet and feel like they're cows.
It's not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the tidallet discreetly placed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use the tirallet.
However, Elvie's tutelage is completely silent, has no cable or tube and discreetly fits into a breast-feeding bra, which gives women more freedom to move, to hold babies and even to get out while she's pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother's first childhood partner and developer, said: "The Elvie Tirallet is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
In tracing parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a gunlet is used and the challenges that it is supposed to do, while we demonstrated, in an entertaining and educational manner, the incredible sense of freedom that the new trailer offers.
It's not the first time Elvie has been on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the street for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrants, quietly moved to a tents camp at the Texas border
The number of children emigrants detained has increased despite the fact that monthly entries across the border have remained virtually stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration have hampered child apparition.
Traditionally, most godparents were paperless immigrants, who were afraid to risk their possibility of staying in the country if they decided to host a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential fathers and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs control officer, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to receive unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who have received or lived in the home of a host are illegal in the country, and a large majority of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
To process children more quickly, officers have introduced new rules that require some to be brought to trial within a month after being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by video conference, instead of presence, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered eligible for help will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are spent in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent branches or escape attempts, according to the workers and reports that the system has made in recent months.
Advocates claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that because of its size, signs indicating that a child is suffering will be overlooked.
They've added that moving children into the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say good-bye to friends can cause a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem asked Syrian refugees to return home despite the fact that the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Mualem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Mualem has insisted that the "war of terror is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displacements.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground of a war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Mualem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational grounds" for refugees wanting to stay away from them.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition takes place to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last great rebellion, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russia's help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem has noted that the agreement has "clear terminals" and expressed the hope that military action will face the jihadists, who include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, sent by the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee formed by government members and opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and preparing the way for elections.
Mulem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump Will Win for the Second Time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, the scandals and the process of removal ended with their presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be "the end of a more dramatic presidency in history."
For now, there are no signs of fatigue in viewers.
Since 2014, the number of full-time viewers has doubled to $1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak time, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" by MSNBC, has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on the main news nights.
"People have been told that they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, the executive producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet decreeman who becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him I'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He answered that because he was making him laugh," said Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself in the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts discussing the use that Bob Woodward made of "private use" fonts for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar fur jacket ("a piece of thick clothing like his pride," headlined Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let's say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes it look like it's part of a telereality program is that every night it gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the character changes and scripting spins of Trump's program (to fight with NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode to stay behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked looking at the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the Supreme Court's future hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did those crazy programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it seems they were right."

Foreign money inundates elections in less-adjusted House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realisation of the congressional districts that have caused two current members to compete in the same square.
This recent reassignment of the Pittsburg suburb involves Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who obtained his place in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, the republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of republicans.
The competition for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the major financial organisations of the parties, the Democratic Committee for Congress (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named after an adjusted victory in a highly followed special election held in March to represent the 18th congress district of Pennsylvania.
The Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but withdraws them.
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian president Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of US diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "new decisions on the failure to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, spoke for the department this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was contemplated, which received US $140 million in 2017 aid, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and high numbers of deaths due to murder and unemployment.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But about mid-September, senior officials in the administration clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, which effectively ended with any likelihood of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for the middle of October, as a sign of the importance the administration gives to it, according to diplomats.
The three American envoys discreetly returned to their positions of responsibility in Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesperson at Bolton's White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that the three officers described, including two diplomats, agreed to discuss internal deliberations since anonymity.
An external analyst, close to administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study history
The next event to take place could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump to justice, of which there are numerous evidences in public records.
As you know, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in his election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the organization, just as he prepares to do so in front of the voters, and even before a jury of party members.
These are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall, or any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, the German officers were prepared to take a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over inflection points like this and it accelerates or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing a number of inflection points today.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with water on his neck since this paper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not fit for the charge.
Rosenstein claims the information in the Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court, even though credible accusations of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And, in particular, will we vote in half the legislature for a Congress that will hold Trump responsible for it?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will begin to be in danger.
But I think we won't fail, because I've already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-lovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday's candles on that table with the swastika.
With this bag, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic towards the party against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers received the Vienna Rapid Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive fourth in the Vila-Real camp this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the G group of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented halffielder Graham Dorrans from being able to play the first minutes of the season up to 2-2 against the Royal Village, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a trampoline for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Vila-real is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the party believing we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else in the end, but in general, the fourth was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first part, but we were better than they were in the second part.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can keep all three points, but it'll be a hard game because they got a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we'll do everything and we'll get a good result with the support of the hobby.
Last year it was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes to the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give everything, leave the season behind and succeed."
Women lose their sleep for fear of savings for retirement
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to the family about it.
Nearly half of polls at national level say they've talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10 percent of the polls claim he's talked to the children.
"People want some family members to take care of them, but they don't dare think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
We need to start over here.
Talk to your spouse and children about how well you can prepare your family to care for such a loss.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to receive attention, since these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation. It can also help you determine how you can pay those expenses.
Your long-term care funding options may include a long-term long-term health insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenses or own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money needed to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the passage into legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical attention and make sure that professionals meet your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary acquisition for your finances.
It is necessary to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elder family has a medical emergency and is on its way to the hospital.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. "The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Since the communications are cut, the relief units have not been able to obtain information from the Domanga region, an area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data about Palu and Domanga, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Domanga is a region that extends over 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
The Regency, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the central Celebes province's economy, especially in the coastal region of Domanga.
Exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it concentrates mainly in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Domanga have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Domanga.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in western Donggana that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific fire belt and there are often earthquakes.
The following are the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the west coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands died on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit southern Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude rocked a pop zone in the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude rocked one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres [10 m] that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the region of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing both destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the earthquake and the deadly tsunami in 2004.
This time, tsunamis did not occur, but more than 100 people were killed in connection with building collapses.
2018: There were a series of major earthquakes on the Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, natural of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and arrest resistance, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a well-known man tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled his phone.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su interim detention centre, where he is held with a non-guarantee obligation of 500 USD, according to KTUU.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, surely" when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin is facing three class A shortcomings, which means he could go to prison for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He's also accused of a class B failure, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time there are criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a drunk weapon in connection with the incident.
His partner said he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for associating her son's violent behavior with a posttraumatic stress disorder derived from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia — hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake rocked the Indonesian Island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media broadcast videos at the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway, at Lower Manhattan and run on passengers and cyclists during his journey, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intendedly" and that "intensely" caused serious personal injuries, according to the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty filed in the district south of New York.
Both crimes could be a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal juror attacked Saipov with a 22-failure indictment including eight counts of murder for organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required "significant planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the South New York district brought to trial a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted by conspiracy to carry out spying actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He's been found not guilty of the 22 missing charges.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We consider that the decision to call for the death penalty, instead of accepting a conviction and a life sentence without the possibility of freedom will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Member of Parliament of the Conservative Party asserts that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians have to "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of the members of Theresa May's own parliament suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks was highlighted when the Conservatives in favour of the union filed another protest against Brexit in La City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Czech commitment plan between the attacks of Brexit's supporters, the Union's supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that they reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative answers and pressure the Euroseptics and the Conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave Solihull rally that he wanted to undo Chequers' engagement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out now,' he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to disengage Chequers."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be helpful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to stay there is completely false."
The conservative party of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said to the reporters: "I only tell you, Prime Minister, that you listen to people."
"Checkers' commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the street and get us to win some election.
Abandon Chequers' engagement and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added, "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that the rally politicians must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"That, now, is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't allow them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that won our victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the union supporters marched to Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A small number of activists shook flags over conservatives against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives because of security problems that they suffered from a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Agreement, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of being a candidate for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll examine the possibility of running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, usual critic of President Donald Trump, presented for his re-election in November against the representative of the state of GOP Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It was the centre of speculation about the possibility of raising Trump by 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with officials with the open assembly format since Trump took over.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for killing Sims, from LSU
Baton Rouge Police, La., announced on Saturday that a death suspect has been arrested on Friday's LSU Wayde Sims basketball player.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET press conference.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday and called for collaboration to identify the man of the film.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot at the head who finally killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday in the media for 247s.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got shot at Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and was taken to custody in the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebots per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the world title after the team's orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas stood before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxing before and left Hamilton running in traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop in boxing and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after some wheeled action that caused the Ferrari pilot to abandon the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen began in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap was in the seventh position on his 21st birthday.
He then went on in much of his career, preserved his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen, and move on to fourth position.
He finally got into the boxers in turn number 44, but he couldn't increase the pace at the next eight times and Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman to whom they told him to let me go.
The team has done a great job to have one-two," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday to insist that she didn't filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate proved that people are "sick, cruel and liars."
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's going on in the Senate these last days, when you see anger, when you see angry, evil, cruel, and lying people," he said.
"When you look at the communiqués and the filtrations and say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?" "Eh, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered-- no, we didn't filter it," she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and filtered in September, but Feinstein denied the filtration from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein explained to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and kept it confidential, as he asked."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using statements for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat for power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants Against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat of Elite's Friday against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5 to 3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-point advantage thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee, then two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan re-placed the home team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants at the first break when he achieved the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and again Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful goal at the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the game at the end of the second part and secured the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next party Friday.
An airplane driver dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller from Indonesia became a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake rocked the island of Celebes on Friday and unleashed a tsunami.
There's a lot of replicas going on in the area and there's a lot of people trapped in the ruins in the town of Palu.
But even though his companions escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grande refused to leave his place at the trembling control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure that flight Batik 6321, which was on the track at that time, could take the flight safely.
Then he left the air traffic control tower when he thought it was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This has broken our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while disaster mitigation agencies have reported that access to the cities of Dongga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the runes and there are still many that could not be accessed," said the representative of the agency Sutope Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six feet [6 m], devastated Palu, who will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying help and crashes.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the derailments have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the crash in the pond
The airline operating a flight that's going to crash into a Pacific pond in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although previously said that the 47 passengers and the crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they had not found a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and the crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane docked in the pond because the track was short.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the lead.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the plane's emergency exits, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and began to scream, and he suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who had worked close to it to improve a dock also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the people affected to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in aircraft accidents recorded in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst makes up a story of the night that burned a woman alive.
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in the trial review of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness to the intelligence analysis field.
He described to the jury how he used his cell phone records to build the defendant's 29-year-old movements, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his earlier statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that day he wasn't in town.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another incoherence was that Telllis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicated that I had only been known for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defense plans to initiate its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to pass the trial on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills its music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of gender.
The High Breed of Bristol ensures that hip-hop has turned away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and fashion the conscious hip-hop again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom by the hands of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY Nanny asks a couple to say goodbye after a "racist" message
A New York nurse denounced a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from her mother protesting because she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay at the fact that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she got to work on the first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO A OTHER BLACK PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to his husband, he sent him to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After she realized of her pifia, a "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, alleging that the nurse she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her working day, and later she was sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims the couple a redundancies compensation and calls for a compensation of approximately USD 350 a day for the six-month residence work for which they had hired her, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," he told the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the statements that they were racists all claiming Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco in the Post.
"But would you leave your children in someone's hands with whom you've been rude, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand to an "extortion," claimed that her wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like this?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is still unresolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: "It's hard to put herself in someone's place that llig for the first time before her publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before having the inspiration to write the children's book on a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was "agredolç" after his death last year.
Describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and shows that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous man," he said.
"But since Paddington was as real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you're proud, even if it's not your own thing.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, I used to recognize Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, they took their daughter to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was very serious and they didn't expect it to pass," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he told me he would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so, pretty.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs he had been given because his body was still beating up and consuming and coming out of his system.
He had died before what was planned and so everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, for I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by relatives and other people.
I had to keep up the good shape."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head cut off and tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for the overwhelming Nad.
The feeling I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her very much."
Women of grief hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have killed themselves are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want no father or mother to hear what I must hear every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, residing in Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile could light any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "for people know that there are people they can turn to, that they can hear, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said he wasn't feeling well nor that he was depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched the bottom of Christmas, when the children opened their gifts and he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
He said his death would be a great trauma to them, but they had to work it out: "Open a hole in the family.
It's ruining us.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is holding on to a thread while the FBI initiates an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday. He also added that he feared that the committee would be destroyed with the rallies' dead end.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to do with the moment.
If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will see weaknesses in getting the man who wants to be elected to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and press them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, since he was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI believes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to clear the room and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean deserters "fall" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Unity Ministry, said that 1,127 deserts had occurred last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made a public comment.
Normally, most Northern deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrants, instead of refugees, and often returns them by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have greatly improved in recent months.
Early in the month, leaders from both countries met in Pyongyang to keep conversations focused on negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to get a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "histeric" and is not fit to work at the High Court.
The leader of the minority of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate for the High Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "histeric" and that his temperament is incapable of working in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have called it a "histeric," Pelosi said in connection with her reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh's before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excitedly, denied the charges of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and running out of words as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee and said that the charges against him meant a " grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that the Kavanaugh witness proved that he could not work in the High Court, as he showed his prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when he was asked if he'd try to challenge the election of Kavanaugh, if it's confirmed, and if Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only able to be in the High Court, but not in the court where you are now," Pelosi commented.
Currently, Kavanaugh is serving as a judge at the Columbia District District Appeals Tribunal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he did not question whether he would annul certain decisions of the High Court.
"It's no time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and expect it to seem wonderful to us," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diary: months and years of abundant fury and can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon.
He went on... "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, telling the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then I kept going.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because, basically, they are misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a masculine majority, where I ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of a bigger woman (a cold directive that had always frightened me a little) who took me from the cliff and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad, because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic MEP in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital adventure on a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of herself as a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-considered decision," he said to me as he laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said "White and the seven dwarfs."
Since he was late in the campaign, he was late for the fundraiser, so he promised he would not enter the race if he did not collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thank you to the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money and for guiding the voters, instead of doing so to the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he was speechless.
"You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder remembered about the press reaction.
"It might have been thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, "What will they put in my grave?
"Did you cry?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing · Global Voices
The initial rescues of the trade war between the US and China were shocking and, although it does not seem that the war should be over soon, a distance countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed taxes on China's main exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth $200,000 million, and these tariffs are taxing half of all the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly counterattacked in the same way and recently raised the tariffs from five to ten percent for 60,000 million dollars of American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the United States, and it is not likely that the second largest economy in the world will soon be back.
Making Washington back leads to giving in to some demands, but publicly leaning towards the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that begin a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had predicted," says Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is prepared for the return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on the street is now more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people who live in the country and who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's selection wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's selection has won the 2018 Ryder Cup in defeating the American selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European selection won the crown again when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, shot the water out into the hole by 3:16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone on all his series and became one of four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated with a 5&4 player less qualified than the European Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
"I don't mean to cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so glad I got the cup back.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I could help," said an excited Garcia after European victory.
It highlights his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost the four matches he had in France and now he has a career record at the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players that ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American selection fought all weekend to search the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pushed the European selection.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's to get your hat off.
We've been defeated."
