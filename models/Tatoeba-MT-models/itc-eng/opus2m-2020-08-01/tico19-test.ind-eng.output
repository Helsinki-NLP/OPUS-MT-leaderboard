Do you feel any other symptoms?
Have you ever felt like breathing?
Do you still feel chest pain?
Because it's the flu season.
But we must not keep the chest wound from the heart.
But the most important problem now is this chest pain
And I'm having trouble breathing.
But I know a lot of people coughing towards me.
But we need to deal with every chest pain very seriously.
But right now you can breathe well?
I really forgot the cause of this chest pain

The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that increases rapidly in the European Union/European and British Economic Area Raya, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative occurrence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trains in the European Union/European and British Economics Zones which confirm that, although the different stages depend on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic develops very rapidly in all countries.
Based on experience in Italy, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units, it is appropriate to increase its effectiveness in providing care for the COVID-19 patients who will require health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the case of pneumonia with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Taiwan.
On January 9, 2020, the Tiokok Disease Control and Prevention Center reported that the kausatif agent of this disease was a new corronavirus now called a heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence so far shows that about 80% of the COVID-19 suffer from mild diseases, that is, respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of the patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease and requires hospital care, while 6% of other cases have a critical disease that requires intensive care.
Mortality of patients treated at the hospital due to COVID-19 about 4%.
In this study, we studied the COVID-19 European Union/European Economics Wilayah (EU/EEA) and British Raya (UK) and compared it with the incident in the Hubei Province of China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and UK
After Tiokkok, the COVID-19 experienced further geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are currently following the pandemic dynamics in Tiokkok.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020, March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first European with the case of COVID-19 confirmed on the basis of the WHO definition.
In the EU/EEA, three first confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 by people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the COVID-19 case has been detected in all 30 EU/EEA and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with the date included, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents in the COVID-19 case
At the European Center for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported by each country around the world is updated every day at 8.00. This amount is obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of that country, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate the COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and UK, and compare it with the trains in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we count the cumulative incident that took 14 days, so we calculate the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, in the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported by each country until March 15, 2020 at 8.00 compared to the Italian case during the period of January 31–15March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
Train cumulative incident was completed 14 days in the EU/EEA and UK in general following trains in the Hubei Province (Tiokkok) (Grambar 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative COVID-19 incident began to increase around 21 February, and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Additional Year).
This train is primarily driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and UK show similar COVID-19 cumulative increase train (Additional Year).
Picture 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data suggest that, until March 15 at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases compared to the total number of Italian cases three weeks before or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported increases rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trains that observe the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicate that the pandemic increases at a rate that is equal to that in all countries.
This is apart from the level differences experienced by countries, the variety of responses to public health, and the possibility of the definition of the case between countries and the differences in the protocol to choose patients to be tested for the confirmation of the CVID-19, which includes the examination of sentencing.
Early in March 2020, doctors in the Italian region who were affected explained the situation about 10% of patients in CVID-19 needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 case acceptance data in the hospital and/or intensive care unit at EU/EAA level is only available for each 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study carried out in 2010-2011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care beds and nurseries in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and the treatment of the media per 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario related to health care capacity poisoning, with an estimate of the prevalence of the COVID-19 case inhaled for each EU/EEA and UK country related to the risk >90% exceeds the capacity of the intensive care bed, provided in the 6th ECDC fast risk assessment of the COVID-19.
Because so far cases are classified in certain regions in the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of specific regional services, information about cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the level of Unit treatment Area for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trains in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, the state, hospital, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenarios and the improvement of the number of COVID-19 patients that require health care, especially intensive care, as in the affected region of Italy.
As shown in recent ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive, and comprehensive approach is very important to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, by shifting from the mitigation approach to the mitigation approach, because the increase in the number of cases that are fast, as anticipated, may not give enough time for the decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if it is not previously applied.
The rapid risk assessment also lists steps in the health of the public to investigate the impact of the pandemic.
A short window of opportunity is available when the country has the possibility to increase its control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA health care system is likely to face a patient outbreak that requires intensive care within a few days or weeks to come.
Chronovirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, which has caused disaster for humans.
Similar to the homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to thousands in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower level of obesity and mortality than SARS, but more contagious and older than young people, and more on men than women.
In response to an increasing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article tries to give timely and comprehensive reviews of the rapidly expanding research subjects.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope that this examination will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The spring festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all the Tionghoa people who were ordered to stay at home during their holidays and weeks after the outbreak of a new virus.
This virus is very homologous with coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and was therefore called COV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemics began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with over 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died worldwide.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "enemy number one" and potentially damaging more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020 that establishes a sequence of viruses isolated from some patients, more than 200 of them have been published about COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This study aims to develop research into a new subject that has developed so rapidly.
As it may be, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by COV, i.e. Middle Eastern Breath Syndrome (MERS, disease in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and prognosis of disease as well as some other unanswered questions, but urgent.
According to tradition, the COV is considered non-lethal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15% of the population to gain 4.
Even so, in this century, we have found CoV that is very pathogenic to humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing the first outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidities and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third COV plague in human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the classification of pneumonia with unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the Republic of the Chinese People.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly into cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the health care provider infection was reported, which indicates that human-human transmission may occur.
On January 23rd, quarantine was held in Wuhan city and the entire public transport was stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on this disease reported that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients directly contacted the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the early location of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague as a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had spread throughout Turkey and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Gb. 2).
Since conditions develop very quickly, the final scope and severity of the plague still need to be established.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following updated epidemic images (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people are over 50 years old, only a few under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected people under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expanded in the class, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from wetane to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from winter to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic reproduction numbers (R0) are 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, according to mass transportation time before the Semi-Summer Festival in China.
Mortality of patients with confirmed cases of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality of all patients of 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are the type of sex (man), age (≥60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large group subfamily of viruses that contain a single camel RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genes: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein tinnitus or spike (S) connects with its cell receptor, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) alterative enzymes and peptidase 4 (DPP4) cells each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The RNA virus genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the virus genome, genomic RNA is accompanied by glycoprotein cover and nucleokapsid protein forms virion-containing vesicles, which then experience fusion with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-CoV type with a genetic similarity over 99.98% of the 10 samples taken; the sample was taken from the outbreak of the plague, meaning the Huanan Sea Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through electron microscope transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in very thin human breathing epithelium.
ACE2 humans were found as a receiver for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S SARS-CoV-2 protein binds with human ACE2 weaker than its bond with S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes non-separate SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new orf3b-encrypted short protein with orf3b-encrypted protein with an orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in virus pathogenesis and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not have a known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure in resolution 2.9 and in a complex with B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that complex, which has open and closed performance, is made up of dimers and ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which are evidence for the recognition and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in prescription drugs to push SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediary
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each one is transmitted to humans through owls and camels.
Using a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoV, bats are considered the original SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical with two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, an intermediary that helps the virus cross the species to prevent human infection is still unknown, and transmission routes still need to be explained.
Ji, et al. suggests the snake as a virus carrier of bats to humans who involve homologous co-combination within S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Turkey, suggest that ringing, breast-cooking long-term ant eaters that are commonly used in traditional Tionghoa drugs, may be an intermediate saRS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in CoV found in tanning and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the differences across the entire genome are still enormous; hence, the conclusive results as evidence are still unreachable.
The physical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar qualities.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and hot light at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfection containing chlorine, assay, chloroform, and other fat users, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disables the virus.
Generally speaking, the entire human population does not have immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and because it is vulnerable to this new virus.
There's not yet a detailed study reporting on immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other studies of CoV before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
Generally, after invasion of angina, viruses are recognized by the immune system carried through standard receptor receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receiver, Toll-like receiver (TLR), NOD-like receiver (NLR), and RIG-I-like receiver (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus leads to the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and interferon synthesis type I (IFN) that restricts virus circulation and accelerates macrophage antigen phagosocytosis.
However, N protein in SARS-CoV can help prevent immune response.
Soon, adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
T-lymphosit, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to viruses, and CD8+ T cells kill directly infected cells.
The T-helper cell produces proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can slow down the function of T-cells by subduing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes compliments, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in combating virus infections.
For example, an antibiotic isolated from a cured patient neutralizes MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large number of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, failure of the mug organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is marked by an aution class, is more about age with nursing and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to viruses in large numbers or whose immune function is disrupted have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The average incubation period estimate SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on study of 425 cases first in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the average incubation period is 3 days and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as explained above, show that the period of incubation 4.8 (3.0-7,2) was based on demography 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adapt effective quarantine times based on the most accurate period of incubation so as to prevent people who are infected, but without symptoms, from transmitting viruses to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early COVID-19 symptoms, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, as well as breath, muscle pain, limb, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after illness.
In severe cases, patient disease develops rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic asidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients suffering from fever and/or acute breathing and fever, even if they are not affected by lung imaging, have to be treated with the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that a percentage of 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% patients need ventilator support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies, namely study in family classes and classes that are transmitted by asymptomatics.
By contrast, the 2012 demographic study showed that the patients of MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% patients require ventilation support, much more than the COVID-19 patient and consistent with higher MERS lethality than the COVID-19 patient.
Diare (26%) and throat pain (21%) also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13-25%) are shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support required for about 14%-20% patients.
By February 14th, the COVID-19 mortality rate is 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Compared with that, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reaches 6.47 with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV is only around 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in the case of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given at Table 1.
Those figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has higher spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but does not kill MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Awyn’s class is often found in one family or in one group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have travel history or live in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact people infected or patients in the last two weeks before the winter.
However, it is reported that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms of more than two weeks and patients returned from the hospital can carry viruses again, which leads to caution to increase quarantine time.
At the earliest stage, patients have normal or decreased white peripheral blood cells.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and aspartate aminotransferase and increased viremia were found in 1,099 patients COVID-19.
Heart and muscle enzymes and hemoglobin levels increase in the blood count of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood levels increase in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels increase, i.e. the fibrin digestion product in the blood, and the lymphocyte count decreases progressively.
In addition to photothoracs were found in large COVID-19 patients and marked with bilateral pride shadow or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, tactical inflammation control, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly exacerbate gas exchange disturbances.
Type I pneumose dysfunction and type II lowers the surface level and increases the surface pressure to lower the lung's ability to expand and increase the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst finding in chest photos is often parallel to the worst disease level.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analyses of the COVID-19 showed pneumosis dequamation, hyalin membrane deconstitution, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, as well as synsitial cells that were concentrated in the lung of the patient who died from this disease, according to pathology virus and ARDS infections and similar to pathological analyses of the patient SARS and MERS.
RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection through the reaction of back transcryptase polymerase chain (RT-PCR) used as the primary criterion for the COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to false negative levels, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
Similar situations also occurred in the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is very important and a necessity to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the technique-based use protocol SHERLOCK to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected synthetic RNA SARS-CoV-2 fragment in 20 × 10-18 mol/L up to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a shut-in barrel within less than one hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly enhance sensitivity and ease if verified on the clinical sample.
Because of the lack of experience with new CoV, doctors especially offer supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying various therapies that have been used or previously proposed for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with anti-virus drugs, immunosuppression, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional thionghoa drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from a cured patient is suggested for use in therapy.
The pharmaceutical companies race to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At an early stage, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacked the lung and may also attack another organ that expresses ACE2 at a lower level, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, dysfunction and failure to breathe is a major threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is essential to ease symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on disease levels.
Patients with severe breathing symptoms should be supported by oxygenation of the extracorporeal membrane (ECMO), which is the thermodifying cardiopulmoner shortcut technique used to treat heart failure or life threatening.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and secondary infection and septic shock, and protection of vital organ function is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in a cytokine storm on SARS and MERS patients.
The sitokin storm is a systemic inflammatory response that is marked by the seriean release of sitokin, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNό, and MCP-1.
These cytokines subjugate immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the primary cause of ARDS and fail the mosquito organs.
Imunosuppression is very important in treating sitokin storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroid and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monochlonal antibody, have been used to handle sitokin storms.
Other immunosuppression handling for sitokin storms include modulation of the immune response given to T cells; relocation of IFN, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; activation of sitokin signals 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroid, as an immunosuppressant, is often used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are useless for severe lung injury to SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can cause heavy side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which greatly influence prognosis.
However, short corticosteroid delivery at low doses is being encouraged to be given carefully to patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.
When writing this review, no effective anti-virus therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous redesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir was a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, again for disease treatment caused by the Ebola and Marlburg virus.
In time, rembesivir also showed inhibition of another single camel RNA virus, which included the MERS and SARS virus.
According to this, Gilead provided this compound for Taiwan to do a series of tests on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin has been suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute breathing symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
This interaction with other drugs used by patients should be monitored accurately.
Plasma from a cured patient and antibody creation
There is a long history of the recovery of patients ’ blood from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent the health of the disease.
True, patients who have been cured often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced lymphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients who are seriously ill.
Their symptoms improve in 24 hours, along with lowering inflammation and weight of the virus and increasing oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification must be done to propose such a method for large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
Further, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma - related deficiencies should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate excessive immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Antibodi concentration in blood is usually low and plasma is required in large amounts to treat a chronically ill patient.
Development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to combat global epidemics are difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identify genetic codes that effectively inhibit or perform an effective antibody coating against proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect largely depends on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula is different depending on the diagnosis of disease based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify the component or its optimal combination.
Currently, since effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 is not available, TCM becomes one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms until they are present or for those who recover from severe disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen were found for the COVID-19 therapy.
The highest level of cure in the COVID-19 therapy is observed in some provinces of TCM using TCM in 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which uses TCM only in about 30% of the COVID-19 patients, has lower levels of cure (13%).
However, this comparison is still very harsh because many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Zhang Boli and his friends combined a study comparing western drug therapy (WM) with WM and TCM combined therapy.
They found that the time needed for body temperature recovery, the loss of symptoms, and the lack of appetite much shorter in the WM+TCM group than just the WM group.
More impressively, the rate of decline (from light to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and mortality is lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM group only (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, TCM's efficiency and security are still waiting for better controlled testing on a larger scale and at more research centers.
The other interesting thing is to characterize the working mechanism and clarify the effective component in the TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most of the patients suspected or confirmed by the COVID-19 were very scared of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and those who were quarantined also felt boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Further, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and coughing and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor symptoms, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicides were reported.
Tracking contact history and quarantine mandatory, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 plague, can make people more concerned and feel guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for patients of the COVID-19, suspected people, and those in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include establishing a multi-dipliner mental health team, clear communication with routine and accurate updating of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and a therapeutic plan as well as the use of professional devices and electronic applications to avoid contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important for cutting chains of animal and human reservoirs infected with vulnerable animals and often being equipped with antiviral therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by viral outbreaks.
The effort has been made to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which, in a long and effective way, makes the antibody penetration and/or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live vaccines have been evaluated on animal trials.
Nevertheless, the in vivo effectiveness of this vaccine candidate in the age and model of the lethal challenge and its protection against zoonotic virus infections still needs to be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS reduced 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported ever since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MERS classes continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using the virus that is disabled, the plasmaid DNA, the virus vector, the nanoparticles, the virus-like particles, and the protein subunits of a recommendation and some have been assessed on the test animals.
Vaccination development against safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 for nonimmuns is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to deal with due to a long time to develop dynamic vaccines (about 18 months) and variations of dynamic CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show full clinical travel to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover without a single stroke.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a model of disease prognosis is essential for health care to prioritize the service, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical study reported so far, the following factors may influence or are associated with the COVID-19 patient prognosis (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 especially occurred at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% elderly patients over 50 years of age in the study of 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have procuring comorbidites and complications and significantly older than patients in need of no intensive care (the 66-year-old medicate compared to 51-year-olds), which indicates age as a prognostic factor for end-of-life CVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 more infected men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Komorbiditas and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to have acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events also caused the primary cause of death on SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be able to connect with a kolanyositis with ACE2-positive, which can result in heart dysfunction on the COVID-19 patient.
Note that basic age and disease are highly correlated and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or tissue injury and is proposed as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between CRP levels and survival and the COVID-19 prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict final results.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during network damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and heart dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Photo thoracics and development of temporary clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict end results and COVID-19 complications.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are widely used as an extension therapy for infection diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors of this disease eventually suffer from an avascular osteokinosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dose and short-term decrease in patients with COVID-19.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer extraordinary stress because they have to endure long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on the study of demographics so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to applying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other COVs that cause seizures.
Therefore, in the early stages or times of incubation, infected patients can produce viruses in large numbers during daily activity, which causes great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most of them do not occur at the early stage.
In this way, the current COVID-19 disease is far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS disease.
Currently, a major effort is being made in China, which includes quarantine of Wuhan and cities around and quarantine continues almost throughout the population with the hope of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this is a major economic and other sector in the country, the number of new patients has fallen, indicating an early epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate states that the plague will end in March and the decline phase will last for 3-4 months.
But some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which seems to be far more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
The group of researchers from Canada reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected at mid-concassions and healed patients' throats and returned from the hospital two weeks before. This indicates that re-identified viruses can be repeated episodes, similar to influenza.
Even so, promising signs happen in China, if seen on the basis of a decrease in the number of new cases, which shows that the current strategy might work.
Ebola's originally predicted would cause a million cases with half death as well.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe also, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus not too pathogenic to be associated with humans.
Compare the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics below.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and it may also be through direct contact with substances contaminated by the virus.
This virus was also found in the fesses so that it creates the possibility of a new transmission, which is a transmission of the fesses-to-mouth.
Recent studies in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which include 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, accurate precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially those who provide health care, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even those who happen to have contact with patients or people who are infected.
The first defense line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (the 1860s series number) help control the spread of the virus.
The surgical masks ensure that the sparks of those who may be infected are not airborne or stick to the surface of the material, where the sparks can continue to be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks can protect against virion inhalation with a size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm.
Because particles can capture even five surgical masks that are planted together, the provider of direct health care with patients should wear N95 (the 1860s series number) and not a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolation clothing to further reduce contact with the virus.
Virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing N95 masks; the virus might enter his body through the eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear facial shields or glasses while working with patients.
For public society in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with infected soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-contained quarantine, and avoid contact with people who may be infected.
Three-legged legs are believed to be suitable for keeping a patient's distance.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a major warning to China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
Nevertheless, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center calmed the population by saying that this new virus has a low quality of distribution and the capacity of limited reproduction from humans to humans and prevention and control of the disease is not a problem.
This message was very soothing to the public, especially as the whole country was preparing for the semi-summer festival, so that this critical time had passed to stem a still small disease in Wuhan.
The disease control body in China should learn from this and make great improvements in the future.
For example, this body should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because every word is observed by the people and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information than clinics than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorized officers; (3) more limited to strengthening the potential epidemic at the beginning, and not attempting to calm the public; and (4) more often performing targeted and effective training to increase public awareness of the epidemics and to test and increase the public response system periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started to be released at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout China and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak gives an impression of the recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some clear differences between the COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important in building epidemics and treating patients.
COVID-19 is more about older than young people and more about men than women, and the level of death is also higher than that of young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% than 1.44%).
The COVID-19 patient transmits the virus even when they are without symptoms, while the SARS patient usually transmits the virus when they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to spread the COVID-19 than the SARS.
This explains some of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
The routine RNA basis for testing SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results to some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured can give positive results again to virus testing.
This finding greatly increases the risk of virus circulation.
With the rapid progress of the COVID-19 research, some important issues still need to be solved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although genetic homology is found 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two similar-SARS-SARS bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal is the intermediate species to sustain the virus from its origin, tell bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we can't cut transmission effectively and the plague can fire back every moment.
Although molecular modeling and biochemistry show that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the airway cell and results in subsequent pathological changes?
Is this virus also related to cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot reach a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic take?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic become a global pandemic, end up like SARS, or repeat periodically like flu?
The answer to the above questions and many other statements is very important, but it may take time to find it.
However, at any cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
Human coronal virus zoonotic source
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven co-evolutionary crown viruses (CoVs) and their inangs, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coVs (HCOV) were known to cause mild disease, such as a fever.
Severe acute breathing syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverse the circumstances and reveal how much HCoV infection can damage and threaten the soul.
Sars-CoV-2's appearance in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoV a resounding and surprising us with a high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonoses, so understanding the origin of HCoV zoonotics will benefit us.
Most HCOV comes from bats.
Some HCoV intermediate reservoirs have also been known.
Animal identification has a direct involvement in prevention of human disease.
Investigating the interaction of CoV-inang in animals can also give an important insight into the pathogenosis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present a general picture of the current knowledge of seven HCOVs, focusing on its discovery history and its zoonotic origin and its interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compared and subtracted the HCoV from the perspective of evolution and genome co-combination.
The disease epidemic CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful angina transition and the involvement of virus evolution in disease survival are also monitored.
Corona virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of RNA viruses hiding, positive inundra, and single frame.
This virus has the largest genome with a size of 26 to 32 kilobesa among the RNA viruses called "CoV", because its morphology resembles the crown under the electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar setting.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open threads (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are bent together, and both are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyprotein.
Polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of open read range (ORF) for structural protein, which includes eyebrows or spikes (S), a veil or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complete proteins that are specific to a particular line of offspring are also categorized by various lines of the CoV.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified as four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genes, beta-CoV has the most HCoV and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
The phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and predators are the source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while nail is the main gamma-CoV and delta-CoV reservoir.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
So far, there are seven known human CoVs.
Among those seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), middle Eastern krona syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as seizures and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing infections of heavy low-breathing channels on relatively more patients and having a higher chance to develop into acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung.
The first HCoV-229E Strain, B814, isolated from the ingus patients of the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through a thorough study of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both causing symptoms of recovery.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infections are generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak occurs.
The SARS outbreak that took place in 2003 was one of the most destructive epidemics in modern history, which infected more than 8,000 people with a severe death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle Eastern Breath Syndrome (MERS) resulted in a continuing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
New 2019 HCOV (2019-nCoV), next known as SARS-CoV-2, is a kausatif agent of the 2019 coronary virus epidemic (COVID-19), which has taken the lives of more than 3,120 people and infects more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare itself for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Those seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins of bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidences support the origin of evolution all HCOVs from bats. On bats, CoVs adapt well and nonpathogenicly, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for the world and the world.
The tracking of the HCoV zoonotic origin gives the skeletons to understand the natural history, the driving force, and the constraint factors of inter-species displacement.
This study can also guide or facilitate the search for an animal reservoir, intermediate, and Sars-CoV-2 amplification, which has an important role in the prevention of future circulation.
In this review, we provide a general picture of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We particularly emphasize and discuss the public subject that HCoV's parent virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but become pathogenic after transmission of the interspecies to the new angel.
We also considered the HCoV evolution train that increased transmission capabilities are often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The final outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to HCoV-229E strain B814's first ingus patients with a fever, various coVs had been isolated from infected animals, which included turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In some of the last bases, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A short history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
Strain HCOV-229E was first isolated from the patient's breathing channel that had an upper vent infection in 1966, which was then adapted to be implanted on the WI-38 lung cell.
Infected patients HCoV-229E showed symptoms of fever, which included headaches, sneezing, nausea, and throat pain, accompanied by fever and cough seen in 10~20% cases.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and serial sequences in the still-infested shrinking brain.
HCoV-OC43 infection clinical images seem to be similar to HCoV-229E infection, which is symptomaticly indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogen infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread throughout the world and are most likely to be broadcast during the winter in the current climate.
Usually, these two viruses are less than a week incubated and followed by a period of illness for about 2 weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, a healthy HCoV-229E infected with mild fever.
Only a few patients with a weakened immune system show a low-breath infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is a pandemic of the first HCoV documented well in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first SARS case can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Turkey.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spread in many countries and continents.
Despite the superintendent, each case is estimated to have caused about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak of virus burden seen on the 10th day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV were initially suffering from myalgia, headaches, fever, leukemia, and itching, followed by dyspnea, coughing, and breathing disorders as further symptoms.
Limphopenia, abnormal heart function tests, and creatine kinase enhancements are a lab disorder that is common to SARS.
The damage caused by alveolar diffusion, epithel cell proliferation, and macrophage increase is also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal channels, hearts, and kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, usually accompanied by cytokines, which can cause death, especially in patients with mild anxiety.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of zero-patient relatives traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus was at first very common in children, elderly children, and patients with low birth defects who suffer from respiratory disease.
Images of corriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and frequent bronchiolitics were found in HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation of 8-month-old male nasal specimens that suffer from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Despite being identified in the Netherlands, this virus actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents approximately 4.7% of the general respiratory disease and the peak events occurred in the early summer, spring, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called a crew.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from 71-year-olds who had been treated poorly because of pneumonia and bronchiolitics in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitics, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 found all over the world, causing mild breathing.
Four HCoV communities have been fully adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into very pathogenic diseases. However, the extraordinary case is indeed for unknown reasons, as in the case of a more recent subtype HCoV-NL63 virulen that has been reported to cause infection of heavy low-breathing in China.
In general, when the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself within humans, these HCOV virulence and pathogens are also reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from 60-year-old lung patients with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases come from the Middle East, import cases with a time of secondary contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The Mers clinical manifestation is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which has so far only occurred to MERS among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with a high case death of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most frightening viruses known to humans.
In mid-December 2019, the class of pneumonia patients retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that an ongoing low-breathing infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and called it COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the death rate of a gross case of 3.4%.
Reportedly, the death of a case in Hubei, Taiwan, is 4.2%, while the death of a case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with images of fever, cough, and breath.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute breathing disorders.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of high nucleotide sequence homology, of 82%, both clustered into a different phylogenetic tree branch.
Sars-CoV-2 pathogonism is obviously lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subject infected SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms has been reported and may play a role in the fast-paced SARS-CoV-2 spread around the world.
Compared to and distinguish SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCOVs show a very interesting similarity and difference.
First, the period of incubation and travel of HCOV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows six other HCOV general trains.
Second, the safety of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four other HCOV communities (such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of HCoV infection in the Community, which includes a slight non-specific or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infections despite a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting patterns, having similarities with HCOV communities as well as SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities are at least as high as HCoV communities.
On the other hand, it lowers the capabilities of SARS-CoV-2 transmission after some pathways on humans still need to be verified, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the fesses sample.
"Is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fekal-oral plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, it still needs to be clarified by the next study."
It's also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of HCoV community.
However, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which includes the capabilities of transmission, pathogenicity, and continued spread in several pathways on humans, will have a profound impact on the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both HCOV and humans may be the species of ancient HCOV pandemic.
HCOV that causes severe diseases to humans and humans who suffer severe HCOV has died.
For this to happen, HCOV has to replicate in humans in sufficient amounts to allow for adaptive mutation accumulations to counter the factors of animal restraint.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 disease survives and more people are infected, the more likely this virus is to be fully adapted with humans.
If the virus adapts well, transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
Over the years, four CoV communities have moved into the human population and triggered an all-out in immunocompetence.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which are highly pathogenic are not adapted to humans and their transmission into humans cannot be defended.
Both have to defend themselves and build zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more interferons and amplifications.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCOV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted like HCOV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCoV community and is not as pathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Still to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to full humanity and spread in humans without any animal reservoir or intermediate.
Before discussing the origin of HCOV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and HCOV amplification.
Animals act as HCoV's evolutionary angel if they have close relatives and share high homologies at a nucleotide sequence.
An ancestor virus usually adapts well and is nonpathogenic in this angel.
Likewise, a reservoir carries HCoV continuously and within a period of time.
In both cases, the angel is naturally infected and is a natural angel for HCOV or the parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV has just entered the middle of the brain just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not been adapted with a new and often pathogenic angel.
This intercom can function as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role as an amply able virus to replicate temporarily, then transmit it to humans to accomplish the scale of human infection.
HCOV may have fatal infections if it cannot maintain its transmission in the middle.
On the other hand, HCOV can also adapt with the intermediate arm and even cause long-term endlessness.
In this case, the middle angel becomes a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data retrospectively reveals that the case zero SARS has a history of contact with birds.
Further study of seroprevalence indicates that the animal salesman has higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.
Musang moon (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market are the first identified with similar-sars-CoV viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the monks in the market were killed.
Nevertheless, it is reported that the moon owls of wild nature or farms that are not found at the market of living animals give the majority of the results of negative testing for SARS-CoV. This indicates that the moon owls may only act as an intermediate appreciation enemy, but not the natural SARS-CoV resorb.
It needs to be recorded, since 80% of the animals in Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it can't be ruled out that many small mammal species may also function as an intermediate saRS-CoV amplification.
All this angel seems to be the final saRS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal for SARS-CoV next reveals a nearby bat's coV, called the Rhinolopus bat's relatives HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found on the bat's Tiokok horse bat's bat.
This bat gives positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and sequences of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome.
This coV and the other bat CoV share nucleotide sequence homologies 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study is the foundation for a new concept that bats are an angel for new human pathogens.
Some SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV) are also identified from bats, but only one, called WIV1, can be isolated as living viruses.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 comes from a sample of bat fesses shown to be using ACE2 bats, owls, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interesting thing, SARS convalesen serum patients can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents an ancestor who is closest to SARS-CoV on bats, with a 95%-induced nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high level of homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus SARS-CoV and a bat is not a direct reserve of SARS-CoV.
Philogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bat and MERS-CoV use the same angina receptor, which is peptide 4 (DPP4), as a way into the virus.
The sequence of polymerase RNA depends-RNA MERS-CoV phylogenetically closer to its weight in beta-CoV bat identified by Europe and Africa.
Until now, no MERS-CoV lives are found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% of the underlying nucleotide homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct reserve of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East showed that Arab camels yielded seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralized MERS-CoV, just like Central Eastern camels in some African countries.
MERS-CoV's life is identical to the virus found in humans isolated from the nose of the Arab camel, which indicates further that the camel is a real reservoir for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that mass virus discharges with symptoms that are usually mildly observed on the test camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It needs to be recorded, the infected camels send the virus not only through the breathing route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of delivery of the bat virus.
However, the question still remains unanswered because many confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, possible as a result of human-human transmission or unknown transmission route involving unknown species of animals carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from Rhinolophus finis bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too great to establish parent relationships.
In other words, bats may not be a direct reservoir SARS-CoV-2, except if CoV bats that are almost identical were found in later days.
It is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 intercom animals are among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Huanan Sea Sea Food Market. Many cases of early COVID-19 are associated with this market, which indicates the possibility of transmission of animals to humanity.
Some of the latest studies based on metatenomic sequences show that a small group of mammals that are threatened with extinction, known as tremoring, may also bring beta-CoV ancestors who are related to SARS-CoV-2.
This new CoV strain divides 85-92% nucleotide sequence homologies with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is as close to the RaTG13 as 90% in the secondary nucleotide level.
Both are grouped into two sub-line viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in phylogenetic trees, one of which shares receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence equivalent of 97.4%.
A striking thing, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are much more different, although the level of uniformity is consistent with the entire higher genome.
Previous study on sick tremors also reported a viral contiguous detection of lung samples, which were also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopts a different method of copying and manually framing to produce a sequence of partial genomes consisting of about 86.3% complete virus genomes.
We can't rule out the possibility of tringling as one of the animals between SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 directly from trumping because of the sequential difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 tingling.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives of SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathways on bats, trinkling, and other mammals still have to be set.
Although the highest secondary homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 kinggling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shared the highest homology at the secondary level of the entire genome.
Too speculative if it is said that the level of similarity between the beta-CoV RBD relative-SARS-CoV-2 kinning and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectively selective convergence along the way.
Comparison hypothesis supports the co-combination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 tranggling and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As an evolutionary factor, many co-combinations occur between beta-CoV.
Researchers still can't decide on the origin of SARS-CoV-2 zoonotics.
Besides highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may come from bat coV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 parent viruses have been found in predators.
It is reported that the coV bat called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected on the bat three colors of North America shows a close to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E genetically correlated with other bat CoV, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae is also expected to be the intermediate.
To be clearer, knowledge of the current origin of HCOV animals is summarized in Figures 1 and Table 2.
phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of HCoV interspecies transmission in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed the species of livestock to infect humans, there was a pandemic of respiratory infection.
History of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is not very clear.
Alpha-CoV bats that are related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between them, there's an alpha-CoV alpaca.
Some evidence supports the direct transmission of viruses from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may be in contact with bats in the ecological loop together.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with the aqapa.
Second, alpha-CoV bats associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV alpaca causes respiratory disease on infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, it is possible that the alpha-CoV relative-HCOV-229E of humans could not be sidetracked.
In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility is that while alpha-CoV bats function as long-range HCoV-229E genes, alpaca and Arabic camels may function as an intermediate channel that transmits viruses to humans, exactly like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a very good example for the interspecies transmission of bats to Arab camels and Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary source MERS-CoV of the bat was known in early identification of the virus and was also reinforced by later finding.
Clearly, bats are rich virus species lengths for interspecies genetic fragmentation and interspecies transmission.
A long age, a colony set up together, a close social interaction, and a strong flying capacity, all are a supportive condition for bats to be an ideal 'virus publisher'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has been adapted to the camel that has changed from the middle angel into a stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in this animal.
His sporadic transmission to humans happens by chance and man remains the ultimate enemy for MERS-CoV because the transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the camel role in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of aging, if any, in different SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Above all, beta-CoV trending is highly pathogenic in treagging.
Tendling may be the final angel for beta-CoV relatives SARS-CoV-2, similar to a mosquito in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animals to humans should be counted or excluded.
First, bats may be a reservoir for a SARS-CoV-2 relative virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological relays with bats by using woodwork or woodwork.
Second, tremoring could be one of the internavigation amplers for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2 relatives virus.
Humans get viruses through slaughtering and consumption of poultry meat.
Perhaps, many mammals, which include pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies survey of pets and wild animals need to be done.
The third, as mentioned above, co-combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that are well-connected with bats and twirling.
The SARS-CoV-2 animal origin search is still ongoing.
Despite various animal species, three main factors on the virus side are also important to facilitate coV crossing the barrier of species.
First, its relative rate of mutation is high in RNA replication.
Compared to another single-band RNA virus, the rate of CoV mutation can be considered "current" to "high" with the average rate of substitution of ~10-4 per year per step, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV against new angels.
CoV has exoribonukase corrections, removals that result in very high mutations, attenuations, or even inviability.
Interestingly, an analog of Remdesivir nucleotide was known to press the CoV replication through the inhibition of this exorinuclease and RNA polymerase depends on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the rate of CoV mutations is about a million times higher than the rate of its inner mutations.
In addition, mutating rates are often high when CoV has not been adapted with an angel.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of mutation, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation with humans.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another angel who is close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV which has adapted to Arab camels.
Theoretically, it's unlikely that genetic decay will quickly cause vaccines and anti-virus agents against SARS-CoV-2 to become ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in the modification of the genome, for mutations and co-combinations, thus increasing the probability of co-evolutionary interspecies, which would be beneficial to the emergence of new CoV when appropriate conditions.
It's supported by a lot of unique open-read patterns and protein functions that are marked at the end of 3′ genome.
Third, CoV often swapped templates randomly during RNA replications through unique "choice-saling" mechanisms.
In an animal that acts as a mixing vessel, the rotation of the camel usually occurs during the RNA CoV transcription.
Full RNA and highly homologous subgenomics can experience co-combinations to form new CoVs.
Natural phylogenetic evidence of co-combination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in CoV animals such as SL-CoV bat and CoV-HKU9 bat.
Virus-inang interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, the interaction of viruses with anang receptor is another major factor affecting the transmission of interspecies.
Here, SARS-CoV co-combination is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection during the interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and owls, SARS-CoV is expected to undergo rapid adaptations in various angels, especially with mutations in S-protein RBD.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and intensively becomes a target response antibody.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is amino acid from 318 to 510 on S1, which connects with human ACE2 and the corresector as a virus entry road.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, musks, mice, and raccoon dogs, allowing transmission of antspecies virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues observed are different between human virus isolates and mussels in RBD and 4 of them located on receptor binding motives for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity for protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
Need to note that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at S1 protein S unit involves the affinity of S protein binding with human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows human ACE2 binding affinity and S SARS-CoV-2 protein 10 to 20 times higher than human ACE2 affinity and SARS-CoV protein.
The important thing to know is whether there are any other corresponsors that may be required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Interesting thing, HCoV-NL63 is also related to ACE2, but with a different part on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidae N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-thersethyl acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after the interspecies transmission of the animal.
In addition to the cell receptor, the end result of HCoV interspecies transmission is also regulated by other dependence factors and limitations.
The difference between human and natural reservoir, such as bats, Arab camels, and predators, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCOV has to take over the angel dependency factor and break down the angel restraint factor in order to succeed in the interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular determinants in the interaction of these important viruses still need to be identified and specified.
The layering of all the endless genomes to see the dependence and limitations factors of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCOV appearance: back to the beginning of the plague
The bat's coV propriety gives us a great opportunity for a new HCoV to appear.
In this case, bat coV functions as a long-range HCOV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic co-combinations also motivate HCoV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, obtaining or losing a new protein-containing gene may drastically modify phenotype viruses.
Among the SARS-CoV-accessor proteins, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in adapting to humans because of the isolated SARS-CoV-relative virus found in multiple ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with special features of elimination 29 nucleotide found on the strain isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that supports the wading of animals.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of co-combination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV descent, with a large number of smaller areas of recommendation identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Cocombination locations are also identified at nsp9, mostly nsp10, and part nsp14.
Similarly, the co-combination of various genera is taking place in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurs in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, co-combination has also been observed in other HCOVs where HCOV has been co-combined with other co-V animals in its non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selections can play a role in unintentional changes in viral genomes, possibly resulting from the release of the virus from the pressure of selection experienced, such as by the immune angina system.
The example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 on the strain prototype HCoV-229E due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat viruses and camels that are related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca shows a single nucleotide aspect that results in a range shift.
Finally, new HCoV evolution is also driven by the select pressure in the reserve.
Mild or untimely symptoms are detected when the coV infected bats, which show different adaptations between CoV and bats.
It seems that bats adapt well with CoV in anatomy and physiology.
For example, failure to activate proinflammatory response on bats will effectively reduce pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, natural killer cell activity on bats is pressed by increased regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell receivers and low-class histocompatibility complex molecular expression levels.
In addition, a high rate of reactive oxygen (ROS) species of high bat metabolic activity can push CoV replication and influence correction by exoribonukease so that it puts a selective pressure on the generation of a highly pathogenic foreign virus when entering a new angel.
A more pathogenic strain of CoV may also develop through co-combination, which results in protein extraction or new protein features for adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two bases.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir nest, such as bats and camels.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong immune response.
This is where the secret lies with the untimely carrier and the cause of a heavy case of human infection.
Especially heavy symptoms due to excessive immune response activation and cytokine storms, with increased lung damage if immune response becomes stronger.
On the other hand, on the untimely carrier, immune response has been removed from the CoV replication.
The same strategy to decide how immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response especially strong on bats.
Therefore, interferon type I gift, at least in the early phase of human SARS-CoV-2 infection, should be beneficial.
In addition, the NLP3 inflammatory activation on bats is defective.
For this reason, the inflammation of NLRP3 with MCC950 may be beneficial in the handling of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 showed up following the general rise of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV bats that share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also coV bats that share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although some other pests and animals in the market were found to carry a virus identical to SARS-CoV, the direct intermediary for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found.
Beta-CoV trending which is highly homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which shows that trangilling may play as one of the internading or beta-CoV trangilling may contribute a fraction of genes to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either intentionally or unintentionally.
CoV is back to focus because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies on bats and other animals have greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoir for HCOV on human transmission.
There's a lot of evidence to show that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 came from bats and was transmitted to humans through the middle angel.
Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and wet-hunts in the market, it may be the closure of the wet market and the murder of all the wet-hunts in it that effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, tringling should be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of some beta-coV kingling lineages that are close to SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms are transmitted to humans through tremoring and other mammals still need to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in Arab camels for a long time.
This camel functions as an important transport tool and as a main source for meat, milk, leather, and product woll for the local community.
Arab camels spread across the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we cannot kill all camels to control MERS, as done at the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop vaccines for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we get rid of this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause a disease.
Various zoonotic CoVs travel in the wild.
Especially, coV bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is a lot of possibility for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience co-combination, which results in the emergence of a new CoV that is easier to transmit and/or more deadly for humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in various parts of China was to be abandoned in order to cut off unnecessary contact with humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, a better preparation and recovery plan must be applied.
Actually, many viruses have been on this planet ever since.
These viruses are in his natural reservoir until there's a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features that support the spread of the virus, human opportunities are intertwined with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
Continuing surveillance of mammals is necessary to understand the CoV ecology and its natural angels, which will prove beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals and future pestilences.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the zoonosis of the virus is for humans to keep a distance from the ecological relays of natural zoonotic viruses.
Some sections of SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic puzzles have not been found yet.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2's ancestor virus to twirling, the condition when bats and bats share ecological relays is an important thing to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, human contact with bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that plays an actual intermediate role, the way mammal interacts with another species, which includes humans, bats, and tremors must be explained.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both trials and surveillance infections have to be done.
Whether bats, trinkling, or other mammals, are expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent virus that is almost identical can be identified in its natural ant in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this field will outline the evolutional SARS-CoV-2 pathway in animals, with an important involvement in prevention and control of the COVID-19 in humans.
Updates of "expected case" diagnostic criteria and "confirmed case" COVID-19 need to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance for diagnosis and management of new 2019 choronavirus infections (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference for combating pandemics worldwide.
Despite this, the 2019 choronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, awareness and knowledge increase based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also being updated.
In this letter, we answered one comment on our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for the "expected case" and "confirmed case" based on the Guide Diagnosis and Management for COVID-19 (the seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of Chinese People.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused a disease, which is now formally called the 2019 kronovirus (COVID-19) disease and the virus is called the kronovirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained the COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed rapid advice guidelines and the guidance has been published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
These guidelines have drawn great attention to the way we have been published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and knowledge that is increasingly based on ongoing research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also being updated.
For example the Guide to Diagnosis and Control for COVID-19, issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of the Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, this commission has produced a total of seven editions with part of the context has changed considerably.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple score offer based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence for our guidance and makes a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We support their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
Even so, their work requires updating based on the latest diagnostics and control guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh test version) and the latest studies.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the expected case, a combination of one of the epidemiological history images with two clinical manifestations is required to perform comprehensive analyses, or a three clinical manifestations are required if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history or stay in Wuhan city and area, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) contact history with SARS-CoV-2 case (with positive nuclear acid tests); (3) contact history with patients who have experienced fever or symptoms of breathing from the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other community where COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) contact history with confirmed case classers (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or breathing symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or breathing symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection imaging features; (3) total white blood count shows normal lymphocyte counts, decreases, or decreases in early autum stages.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on the expected case with one of the pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time positive PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequences of all viruses show high homogeneity for known new corronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibody changes from negative to positive, or titer increase ≥4 fold at recovery stage above acute phase.
We can see that the CRP actual-time nuclear acid test in the sample of the breathing or blood channel added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third issue (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); then serological evidence added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on further research by researchers to find optimal acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the breathing channel including blood removal, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the provision of specific positive antibody results into confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more evidence to remind us to watch out for patients with atypical symptoms and no symptoms.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. alloy chart must be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in practice and clinical studies in the future.
As a closet, we hope that more direct evidence will appear and ask readers to comment.
To diagnose the "expected case" and "confirmed case", we recommend following and obeying the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also update our guidance on time as help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths as a result of COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in one day as a result of that virus.
Until yesterday, Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research Bangladesh reported the number of reported infections involving 114 active cases and 33 home-based healed cases.
Totally 17 deaths.
In a news bulletin, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that death covered four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41 and 50.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of those who died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video online announcement, Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obadul Quader said that public transportation would be stopped longer than originally planned, until Saturday.
This public transportation stop has started since March 26th and planned to end on Saturday, April 4th.
Transporting basic necessities -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection incident recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8, on two people who had just returned from Italy and one of them as well.
On March 19, the three men recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronary virus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the crown virus.
The peak occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infection and Zambia suffered its first death in connection with the coronary virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free from the infection of the crown virus.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Middle European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States (AS), there are over 244,000 cases of crown viruses, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reports, which quote data Johns Hopkins University, there are over 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronary virus infection.
All over the world, countries announce more stringent action to curb disease spread.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, extended the territory to 40th of May.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians would remain paid without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament took a vote to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote was won by 215 votes in support, ten abstinent votes, and one vote declined.
Saudi Arabs extend the hours of night in the sacred city of Mecca and Medina all day long; before, the night only occurs between 3 and 6 o’clock.
Thailand's planning on applying the night clock between 10am and 4am.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended its domestic order until May 1st.
Australian store lowers the purchase limit of toilet tissue for transactions
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, the Australian Woolworth and Coles store network each lowered the limits of the purchase of toilet paper up to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at national level.
ALDI also applied the limit of one sir, on Monday.
This restriction is announced as a message in the case and on the Facebook page of its network.
The buyers are reported to have accumulated supplies due to the fear of the COVID-19 if society should do independent isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for delivery to the house for up to one pack per order.
This change follows the limitation of four packs per transaction previously applied Woolworths and Coles each on March 4 and 5.
In his statement on March 8th, Coles reported that with the bullying of the four packs, "many stores are still out in an hour since the delivery," and mentioned the request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, calls it "unforeseen".
The sales of "faster" last week, according to one of the speakers, Woolworths.
Costco stores in Canberra also limited the amount allowed until two packs last week.
In order to avoid overruns, Coles ordered a larger order than the supplier and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made provision for special Wednesday promotion activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, the executive director of Australia's Oil Association, said that the oil tank was trying to increase the supply, but the local government body limits for the time of delivery of the truck made it difficult.
He anticipates the increase in production costs, while the sellers are trying to meet the demand, and less special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the early release of supplies, some stores could not carry out a special Wednesday.
In a report News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a ritual scholar from Queensland University of Technology, says the shop fills supplies every night.
He stressed that the toilet tissue was a large item so that the amount of supplies was low and, if sold out, made a lot of empty space in the racks so that the quantity of the goods became more expensive.
Coles and Woolworths say [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and treatment can be [bought] and there's in large amounts, anxiety may be minimized, using Russel Zimmerman through the ABC News Office.
The producer of the toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made the Kleenex Toilet Fabric, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, pressed them to work 24/7 to keep the supply, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some real estate dealers offer free toiletries to the first auction dealer in Melbourne, when less auctions are held because the buyer takes a break for long weekend holidays.
The edition of Thursday NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, includes eight pages intended for cutting and using as a toilet tissue.
The stores actually refused to apply the limits, according to ABC Australia's report on March 3rd, they said that they were not planning to apply the limits of the purchase.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, treatment, dry foods, handwashing soap, and flour.
Likewise outside Australia, on Sunday afternoons the British online supermarket Ocado was observed limiting the purchase of the Andres toilet paper until two packs of 12 scrolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) says COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak—disease caused by the corronavirus SARS-CoV-2—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to how wide the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemic journey.
If the state detects, tests, handles, isolates, and immobilizes its people in response, it uses Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We were very careful because of the level of preaching and the anxiety and the anxiety of both the laxity and the fear of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center of Control and Prevention of Diseases, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, there was no breathing-channel virus ever traced from its onset to a continuous global spread."
Gebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by the kronovirus."
He goes on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new state of the pandemic followed WHO's decision in January that declared this plague as a blight of society's disparate world.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "the point is, this disease will get worse."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reported there are at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) which is continuing and caused by the 2 heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a Health Disease that ravaged the World on January 30, 2020, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been healed.
The number of fatalities is estimated to be 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and dry breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute breathing syndrome.
Time from exposure to symptoms usually takes about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific anti-virus treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive action includes washing your hands, shutting your mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and isolation alone for those who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by dealing with travel, quarantine, nighttime, hazardous workplace control, and the closure of facilities.
The pandemic has caused major global economic social unrest, delay or cancellation of cultural, political, religious, sports, and widespread supply of items that are aggravated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been well closed at national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting some 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
The misinformation about this virus has spread online and there is a xenophobia incident and discrimination against the people of Tionghoa, people with offspring and appearances of East and Southeast Asia, and people from areas with significant virus cases.
As a result of heavy industrial downturns and closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decrease.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (city of Hubei propinity), reported the classification of pneumonia case with unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and the investigation was done in early January 2020.
Those cases are mostly related to the Huananan Sea Food Market and therefore the virus is expected to have a zoonotic origin.
Viruses that cause a disease called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is related to bat corronavirus, corronavirus ringing, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no clear connection to the next wet market class.
Among the early case classes reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have something to do with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, on 55 years of age from the province of Hubei, was likely to be the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case being reported down in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
Until February 26, relatively few cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds below forming 2.4% cases around the world. The head of British scientific advisor Raya, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before the immunity of the group can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested by COVID-19 and whose results have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was estimated to be greater than the reported case.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number is likely 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers are cured.
For those who do not recover, time from developing symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, some 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In China, until February 5, about 80% of deaths occur in people over 60 years of age and 75% have a previous health disorder, which includes cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual number of fatalities caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, considering that official numbers may not include those who died without being tested, such as home, nursing home, etc.
The partial data from Italy found that the excess number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by factor 4-5 times.
A female talker for the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Center admits, "We know [number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number", a statement strengthened by a non-historical report on the U.S. reckoning too low. Too low a survey often appears in the pandemic, as in the 2009 H1N1 pig flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of Turkey occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
By February 28th, outside the land of China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories have reported death, in every continent, except Antarctica.
This number varies according to region and time, and is influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time from the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of death to case reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified period of time.
According to statistics Johns Hopkins University, the death ratio against cases overall is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) per 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the region.
In China, an estimated death ratio of 17.3% (for people with symptoms 1-10 January 2020) is 0.7% (for people with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Another estimate includes case fatalities (CFR), which reflect the percentage of those diagnosed who died of certain diseases, and the number of fatalities infection (IFR), which reflect the percentage of those infected (diagnosis and non-diagnosis) who died of certain diseases.
This statistic is not time-bound and follows a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of fatalities infection for the pandemic overall between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate is consistent with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyzes the impact of the CFR estimate.
WHO confirms that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end duration of this plague is unclear and may be different according to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Without control, a contagious disease usually takes place and then begins to drop when the disease runs out of the available angina.
But it's almost impossible to make a reasonable projection right now about when it happens."
Senior medical advisor to the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan said that "this plague may end June" if the whole country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on the rare steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, possible until one or two years."
According to the Imperial College research conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical limitations and other steps will require "so that the vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easily transmitted, can disappear entirely" and this disease "may have turned into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The repeat virulence will depend on the immunity of the group and the level of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
A rare symptoms include fatigue, the production of breathing sputum (flagma), the loss of the smell, asphyxiation, joint pain and muscles, throat pain, headache, headache, vomiting, haemophysics, diarrhea, or sinuses.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including breathing difficulties, depressed chests or chest pain, sudden confusion, walking difficulty, and vision on the face and lips; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms occur. Further development of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some people who are infected may be asymtomatic, that is, without clinical symptoms, but with the results of tests that confirm infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are close to those who are confirmed infected should be monitored closely and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa estimate asymtomatic ratios ranged from a few to 44%.
The period of incubation (when between infections and symptoms) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, uncertainty, the estimated number of patients with COVID-19 who lost their initial sense of smell was 30%, and then decreased to 15%.
Detailed arrangements for the spread of the disease are still under way.
The COVID-19 distribution is believed primarily to occur during close contact and through a small droplet produced when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that unplugged coughs can cause droplets of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be transmitted by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when talking. Breathers can also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although these viruses are generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplet can fall into the mouth or nose of someone close to it or maybe inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and lung heart resuscitation (RJP), can make breathing secretes turn into aerosol and spread through the air.
Preaching can also happen when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the fesses, this risk is believed to be low.
The government of China is viewing the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The most contagious virus in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and at a further stage of disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before symptoms, which indicate transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few asymtomatic case reports are laboratoryly confirmed, but asymtomatic transmissions have been identified by some countries while investigating contacts.
The European Center for Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others. This virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
Specifically, found that viruses can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylen) and 304 steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although the British authorities suggest washing their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have affected infected people.
Koronavirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the classer case of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features are associated with coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if it has home soap, which crosses the protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is close to the original SARS-CoV.
Virus is estimated to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that coronavirus is genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B line) along with two bat-based gallars.
This virus has a 96% similarity in the entire genome level with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, researchers Tionghoa found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of a sequence of genomes between stem viruses and human viruses.
Until now, the comparison of the entire genome has found the most 92% of the genetic similarity between coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the grinding is an intermediate saris-CoV-2.
Virus infections can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, but confirmation is finally done through the reaction of the back transcript polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) on infected secret or through CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan showed that CT significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with the number of graphic features that tend to persist with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a first-line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first released on January 17.
Test using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on a sample of breathing or blood.
The results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is done on the nasopharynx, but the throat valve can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
By 6 April 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to approve its use widely.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of computed radiography and tomography (CT) in a symptomatic person include a deep glass peripheral asymmetry and no pleura efusi.
The Italian Radiological Society is building an international database for the finding of imaging on confirmed cases.
Because it is stagnant with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificities in identifying COVID-19.
A major research in China compared breast CT results with PCR and showed that although less specific for infection, more rapid and more sensitive imaging is recommended to be considered as a screening tool in the epidemic area.
Convoluted neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the features of the imaging virus with radiography and CT.
Strategy to prevent the spread of this disease includes maintaining good personal hygiene comprehensively, washing hands, avoiding eye, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing tissue when coughing or bleeding and immediately throwing tissue into trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical restraints are also recommended to prevent the spread of corruption.
However, the virus has reached the scale of society in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the community don't know where or how they are infected. The provision of health care that handles people who may be infected is advised to do standard precautions, contact prevention actions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of the location data from the phone by the government for this purpose has triggered privacy issues, with the exit of the statement by Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for this kind of surveillance limitation.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on friendly privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user distance to another phone.
Next, the user will receive a message if they're close to someone who's tested positive for COVID-19. Dispatch misunderstanding on how to prevent infection; for example, discoloring the nose and foaming with non-effective blood pressure.
There's not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing hands is encouraged to prevent disease from spreading.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after a toilet or when their hands are dirty; before eating; and after a nose, cough, or sneeze.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, viruses were killed by household soap that damaged the protective layer.
Further, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand-hand treatment with at least 60% alcohol content based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of latitudes (in one minute disinfection for the surface of a solid surface), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other pathways, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexide gluconate, are not effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of CVID in the public facility, such as office or childcare, all areas such as office, bathroom, public area, electronic equipment together such as tablet, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machine used by sufferers, should be disinfected.
The health organization recommends that people close their mouths and noses with elbows or tissue when coughing or sneezing, and then immediately remove the tissue.
The surgical mask is recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and length of expiratory droplets that are spread during speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and manner of masking.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch faces with insufficiently clean hands, which is the main source of transmission."Maskers are also recommended to be used by people who may be suffering from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for COVID-19 sufferers, although WHO also admits that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage masking to members of the community.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of non-medicine masks made of cloth. Turkey specifically recommends the use of medical masks once used to healthy society, especially when close to (1 meters (3 feet) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transportation or living in crowded areas.
Thailand’s health officers encourage people to make home masks and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited the public from going out to the public without wearing masks or covering noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear masks when they went to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government forced everyone who entered the torpedoes to wear a mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear masks when they were in public places.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, requires train passengers and city buses to wear face masks on April 1st.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time outside the house, and recommends the creation of the fabricated face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social limitation (also called physical limitations) is an infection control action intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing contact between individuals.
Social limitation methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can apply social restrictions by living at home, restricting travel, avoiding public areas, using uncontacted greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
At this time, many governments have been forced or subjected to social restrictions in areas affected by the plague.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations were quickly reduced, starting from 250 people (if unknown as a group of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany forbids meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Age and people with medical conditions are based on diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and disturbed immune systems that have a risk of serious illness and higher complications are recommended to the CDC as much as possible at home as possible in areas with illnesses in society. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "social salvation" into "physical restriction", to clarify that its purpose is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relations, both virtual or from a distance.
The use of the term "social restriction" implies that people must completely isolate themselves socially and do not encourage people to keep in contact with others by alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This recommendation includes an encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or virus symptoms.
Self-insulation at home is recommended for those diagnosed with CVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
The health authorities have issued detailed instructions for the proper isolation.
The strictest self-induced quarantine instruction is issued for those who are high-risk groups.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to the country or region with extensive COVID-19 circulation are advised to do quarantine independent for 14 days since the last possible posting.
Strategy in disease control is support or suppression, and mitigation.
Concentration is carried out at the early stage of the outbreak and is intended to track and isolate infected people and take other steps to control the intended infection and vaccination to stop the spread of disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to spread disease, the next effort moves to the mitigation stage: these steps are taken to slow down the spread and reduce the impact on the health care system and society.
Combination of restraint and mitigation actions can be done at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1.The advantage of the management of infectious diseases is to try to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as the epidemic curve.
It lowers the risk of failure in health care and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to deal with the disease include individual prevention, such as hand-cleaning, facial masking, and self-sustaining quarantine; steps at the level of the society that is destined for physical limitation, such as closing the school and canceling the mass meeting; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in this kind of intervention; and steps at the level of the environment, such as surface clearance; and other drastic measures intended to stem the plague in Turkey when the outbreaks of the epidemic are becoming apparent, such as parading the entire city and making a strict travel ban.
Other countries also apply various steps aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduces a mass coverage and local quarantine, and warns about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for those infected who make quarantine independent and wear large fines for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of facial masks and punishes the farmers of medical supplies. Simulation for Britain and the United States shows that mitigation (suffering, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) has a major challenge.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but it still results in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Removals can be selected, but need to be held as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if it is first reached), because otherwise the spread will slide back quickly as the suppression steps are delayed.
Long-term interventions to push the pandemic have a social and economic impact.
There is no specific anti-virus drug approved for COVID-19, but the ongoing development effort, which includes an existing drug test.
Including a flu medicine that sells free, drinks sufficient water, and rest can help ease symptoms.
Depends on levels of obesity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and breathing support may be required.
Steroid use can make patient conditions worse.
Some previously approved compounds for treatment of other viruses are being studied to be used in treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and domestic disputes" can reduce symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that improving capacity and adapting health services to the needs of the COVID-19 patient is a basic step in responding to the disease.
ECDC and the European Regional WHO office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing on laboratory services for the COVID-19 testing, if possible canceling the elective procedure, separating and isolating positive patients COVID-19, and increasing intensive care capabilities with personal training and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known new cronovirus case can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Turkey.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
These cases are mostly related to the Huananan Sea Food Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A classer pneumonia with an unknown cause was observed on December 26th and handled by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Province Hospital, who informed the CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27th.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Center Hospital told their colleagues about "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false goddesses, and the others, Ai Fen, were reproved by his boss for his outposted warning.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then released an announcement to the public on December 31st and told WHO.
Quite a lot of unrecognized cases of pneumonia were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan that then triggered the investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, supported by migration during the New Year Imlek and because Wuhan is the hub of transport and main railway transit.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.On March 26, the United States has surpassed Turkey and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. By April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 people have died and over 364,000 were healed.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Because of the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen Region restrict free movement and control the borders.
National responses include steps to control, such as quarantine, a command to stay at home, a command to protect at home, or a quarantine at night. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in one of the 40 regions in the United States, more than 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in the region in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some kind of state of quarantine, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed COVID-19 case can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report shows the first case on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixian observed the classification of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 26th; this observation was reported to CDC Jianghan on December 27th.
The early genetic testing of the sample of patients on December 27, 2019 indicated that there was a coronavirus similar to SARS.

On 23 January, as a response to the central government's decision to apply the transport ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea said that although the step was "clearly not WHO recommendation," but it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to prevent the epidemic in the most concentrated place of the plague" and he called it "never before in the history of the health of society."On 30 January, after the confirmation of human transmission to humans outside of China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that this outbreak was the People's Global Health Disorder (PHEIC), which is the sixth PHEIC since that step was first carried out during the 2009 Baji flu epidemic.
Director General WHO Tedros Adhanom says that PHEIC is stated because of "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-sized countries that do not have a poor health system.

Some officials in China, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected previous confessions of the first coronary heart disease in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theory about COVID-19 from the United States or Italy.
The U.S. government Donald Trump referred to the corronavirus as "Tiovirus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "Tioku's attempt to cover up the virus now turned into a global pandemic."

Many Koreans signed a petition, either calling for Moon's judgement, based on their claims of government error in dealing with the plague, or praising the response. The pandemic has allowed many countries to respond by issuing emergency laws.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable the government to strengthen its zeal for authority.

The steps of China and Italy in combating illegal consumption and trade are successful so that the anticipated lack of acute food will be avoided in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural productions, has not yet experienced declines, but prices can increase according to industrial representation.

The central bank reacted faster than they did at the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst - hit sectors because of travel bans, the closing of public places including tourist sites, and government action that restricts travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled flights because of a slight demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British Flybe regional airline collapsed.
The impact on the navigational industry is on a level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic is consistent with Chunyun, the main travel season related to New Year's Eve Imlek.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central government and areas, including annual New Year’s Festivals, and private companies were also alone closing shops and tourist sites, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year’s Eves Imleks and tourist sites were closed to prevent mass meetings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and the traditional temple exhibition.
In 24 of 31 provinces, the city ofmadya, and the province of China, authorities extend their holidays until February 10 and command most of the work not to be reopened until that date.
These areas are 80% domestic GDP and 90% domestic exports.
Hong Kong increased the discharge of communicable diseases to the highest level and announced an emergency situation, closed school until March, and canceled the New Year's celebration. Ritel sectors were globally affected by the reduction of working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to European and Latin America's retailers fell by 40 percent.
North American and Middle East researchers have decreased by 50–60%.
It also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to the center of shopping in March compared to February.
The global shopping center operator is doing additional steps, such as increased health care, the installation of thermal scanners to check the buyer's temperature, and the cancellation of the event.
In January and February 2020, during the summit of the Wuhan epidemic, some 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the 300 million migrant workers in the countryside of China are housed in the provinces of the country or trapped in the province of Hubei. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the kronovirus epidemic can cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate to 32%. The region quarantine in India has caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid by daily wages) to unemployed. Surveys from Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some kind of job loss. Almost 900,000 workers have lost jobs in Spain since it had forty regions in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers filed a universal credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany submitted a short-term work scheme subsidized by the government for their employees, known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Worldwide, the arts and cultural heritage industries are deeply influenced by the pandemic, which affects the organization and individuals, both employed and self - employed.
The arts and culture sector organizations strive to support their high mission (often public-funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the public, to preserve employees and society's safety, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, venues, and other cultural institutions were closed without time, with exhibitions, events, and performances canceled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The impact of this new and very fast-growing disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion venues.
The film industry was also disturbed, and the Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebration in Rome, which fell during the last week of Christian repentance, was canceled.
Many denominations encourage Christian age to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services through radio, direct broadcasts, or television, while others offer a drive-in or a rise.
With the closing of the church and the chapel of the Roman Catholic Church and the removal of the Holy Peter from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled the service and restricted public meetings at the church, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurneys.
Iran's Ministry of Health announces the cancellation of Friday's prayer in the area of the plague and the places of worship then closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibits the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants into sacred places in Mekah and Medina.
This pandemic has caused the most significant disruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the EUFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the NHL 2019-2020 season.
This plague messed up the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympics Committee announced on March 24 that it would be "scheduled until after 2020, but not more than summer 2021." Worldwide, casinos and other games are closed and live poker tournament broadcasts are postponed or canceled.
This caused many players to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites reported significant new registration increases. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or canceling concert tours.
Lots of great theaters like Broadway also delay all the shows.
Artists explore various ways to continue to produce and share works via the Internet as an alternative to a direct traditional show, such as a live online broadcast concert or making a web-based "festival" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their works.
Many Internet themes of coronavirus are spread online with many people turning to humor and diverting attention in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 plague, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the people of Tionghoa and East Asia, as well as against people from the affected regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion, and intense hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) record racist sentiments revealed in various groups around the world that the Tionghoa deserve the virus or receive what they claim as the ultimate reward.
Some countries in Africa have also increased anti-Tiokok sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on account of their region.
There's already support for the Tionghoa people, both online and offline, and for the people in the affected areas.
Subsequent outbreaks of outbreaks into the new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe with a serious COVID-19 outbreaks could also be targeted at suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in the countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially sign a petition to prevent the Tyonghoa from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become a Twitter train.
The Tionghoa and others in Britain and the United States reported an increase in racist and assault harassment.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus "Virus Tiokkok", a term that critics considered to be racist and anti-Tiokkok.
The taste shows in Ukraine attacked buses that took Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East India, bordering on Tiokkok, and learning in major cities of India were reported to have been subjected to harassment related to the coronary heart disease.
The president of the Bharatiya Party Janata state unit in the Western Dilip Ghosh states that Turkey has destroyed nature and "that's why God takes vengeance on them."
That statement was then threatened by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "misleading".In Turkey, xenophobia and racism against non-Tionghoa people are stirred by pandemics, with strangers described as "foreign rubbish" and targeted for "hijacking".
Many of the newspapers using pay claims have erased it for some or all of their coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers make science-related outbreaks available with open access.
Some scientists choose to distribute results quickly on the printer server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for 2019 choronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes a method that detects virus presence and detects the produced antibodies as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the sample is confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus only.
This test is used to confirm a new infection or is still active.
Antibodies detection (serology) can be used for the diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Antibodies test shows the number of people who have been infected, including those who have symptoms too light to report or who have no symptoms.
The number of mortalitys that are accurate and the level of immunity groups in the population can be determined by this test result.
Because of the limited testing up to March 2020, no country has any background data on the prevalence of viruses in its population.
By 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of testing countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of fatalities reported, which is likely to be too high in some countries.
Using the reaction of the polymerase chain real-time transcription (rRT-PCR), this test can be done on the breathing sample obtained by various methods, including nasofaring or sputum sample.
Generally, results are available within hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on the throat valve can only be relied on in the first week of the disease.
Eventually, the virus could disappear in the throat as long as it continued to replicate in the lungs.
As an alternative, for the infected person tested in the second week, samples can be taken from the deep breath channel by using either the inhalation catheter or the materials emitted through the cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
British Raya also developed a test on January 23, 2020.South Korea's Kogenebiotech company developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2-based SARS-CoV (PowerCheck Coronavirus) device, which was licensed on January 28, 2020.
This device looks for the "E" gene that has all the beta coronavirus, and the RdRp gene that is specific for SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approvals from the National Medical Product Administration in China for the SARS-CoV-2 CRP-based device. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes RT-PCR Real-Time Koronavirus New 2019 diagnostic panel (2019-nCoV) to the public health laboratory through International Reagent Resource.
One out of three genetic tests in the old version tests yields unconvinced results due to reactive errors, and the number of tests in the CDC in Atlanta is limited; this results in an average of less than 100 samples per day being processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components considered to be unreliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that the state laboratory and the local laboratory are allowed to perform the test.
This test was approved by the United States Drug and Food Supervisor based on the Authorization of Emergency Use.
By March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of the COVID-19 test based RT-PCR on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made a national COVID-19 test available on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit announced; collection and processing of specimens must be done in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the National Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Surveillance Service in Health Care. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop a test for detecting COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that could be performed within 3.5 hours with a high volume so that a machine could perform approximately 4.128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorisation to Holological, LabCorp, and Thermal Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cephed also received from the United States of America an FDA test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing using the amplification technology of isothermal nuclear acid that is not PCR.
Since there is no need for a series of temperature change cycles, this method can yield positive results only within five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 machines in the US and Abbott anticipate to increase production until they produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monochlonal antibodies that specifically bind new nucleokapsid protein (N protein) corronovirus is being developed in Taiwan, hopefully can yield results within 15 to 20 minutes like rapid influenza tests.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "photo chests have a small diagnostic value at the beginning stage, as the CT [computed tomography] may already exist before the onset of symptoms."
Typical features of CT include bilateral ground-glass multilobar opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura dominance, crazy Paving, and consolidation are formed as a result of disease development.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the current pandemic point showed that CT significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many supple imaging features tend to be with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for the first line test in the diagnosis of the COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended the PCR for the early one.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals from about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity from disease, and in population surveillance. Inspections can be done in the center laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care (POC).
The automatic system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to do this check, but the availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, usually one peripheral blood specimen is used, although a series of specimens can be used to follow immune response.
For PoCT, a sample of peripheral blood was generally used that was obtained through a skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not required before the examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentions 29 agencies that provide notification to the agency as needed and so it can now distribute their antibodies tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test approved by the FDA was authorised for emergency use. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics had European approval for their IgG and IgA antibodies to viruses in blood samples.
The ability to test up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR checks on RNA viruses.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after weaning infection. At the beginning of April, Britain found that none of the antibodies it bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong sets out a scheme for the expected patient to stay at home, "the emergency department will provide a specimen tube to the patient," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results a few moments later. The British NHS announces that NHS is pioneering a sample of the suspected case test at home so that it eliminates the risk of the patient sending others to the hospital or must infect ambulances if used. On the standard test for the suspected case of COVID-19, a professional health force will take samples using appropriate precautions.
The high-level testing centre has helped South Korea carry out the most rapid and extensive testing compared to any country. On 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Germany says that Germany has about 12,000 tests per day in road patrol settings and 10,700 tests have been performed in the previous week.
Costs are borne by health insurance if tests are requested by the doctor.
According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a standard test was offered in a number of major cities.
By 26 March 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey reveals that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested up to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Hospital Technion and Rambam develop and test methods to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by merging samples and only testing further if the combined sample was found to be positive. In Wuhan, an emergency pendant laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin language: 中, or "Fire Mata" in Indonesian) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction monitored by BGI founder Wang Jian and it took 5 days, the modeling showed that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the cost related to quarantine management could double if this test capacity did not exist.
Wuhan Laboratory was immediately followed by Huo-Yan Lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
By March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. Multiple source design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This balanced design can be carried out in a small laboratory without needing robotic fluid treatment.
By March, insufficient and insufficient amounts of reagents had become a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, Britain, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are attempting to explore sample sampling protocols involving sample heating at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the Arab Emirates was reported to do more coronavirus testing per population captain than any country, and ready to increase the testing scale to reach most populations.
This is achieved through a combination of standard testing and mass mass-resale laboratory purchases from Group 42 and BGI (based on the emergency detection laboratory "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, this lab is capable of performing tens of thousands RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of China.
Various testing recipes targeting various sections of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in Turkey, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted German prescriptions for the production of testing tools that were sent to low-level countries without any resources to develop itself.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Center was not available until January 28, so that it slowed down the testing available in the United States. Early in the outbreak, Turkey and the United States were having problems with the effectiveness of testing tools; these two countries and Australia could not provide sufficient testing tools to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that the extensive testing available in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow down the expansion of the CVID-19 pandemic. A high demand for testing because of widespread viral circulation causes hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for testing in the U.S. private laboratory, and supplies of slugs and chemical reagents become critical.
In March 2020, Tiokok reported an accuracy problem on their test equipment.
In the United States, a test tool developed by the CDC has "decided"; the government then removes the bureaucratic obstacle that prevents private testing. Spanish buys testing from the company of Tiongkok Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results are not accurate.
The company explained that failure in collecting samples or in using test equipment may result in some failure.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would attract incorrect equipment, and replace it with another test device provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic of Tiokokokuk gave an incorrect result.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that this test device be thrown into the Danube River. Kara's essay from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the tested equipment purchased from Turkey in Turkey had "high fault levels" and they didn't "use it."Ingris Raya bought 3.5 million testing tools from Turkey, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that this test tool could not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine of positive tested people and tracking of people who contact positive people SARS-CoV-2, gives positive results.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, the first location of death due to COVID-19 in Italy, performed two rounds of testing on the entire population of 3,400 people, about 10 days.
About half of the positive tested people have no symptoms, and all cases found in quarantine.
With restrictions on travel to this community, a new infection was eliminated at all.
With aggressive contact tracking, restriction of entry, testing, and quarantine, the coronavirus 2020 pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than other developed countries even without extreme restrictions, such as the closing of restaurants and ritual companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that people stay at home on March 28, but the schools were reopened in the early hours of the holiday on March 23.
Some other countries also handle pandemics with aggressive contacts, restrictions on entry, testing, and quarantine, but with quarantine areas that are not too aggressive, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower number of fatalities, perhaps because these countries are more capable of detecting people who have mild symptoms or have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive samples of COVID-19 and the first ten negative samples to one of 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Out of 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the “positive test result” column was influenced by the country’s testing policy.
A country that only tests people in the hospital will have % higher positive results than a country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show signs or not, with other factors.
Washing hands, also called hand-cleaning, is an act of cleaning the hands of someone who intends to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at a certain "critical moment" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal-oral pathways.
People may also become infected with respiratory disease, such as influenza or fever, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Five critical days of washing hands with soap are: before and after pouring out the water, after cleaning a child's ass or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or raw garlic.
If there is no water and soap, hands can be cleaned with ashes.
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning kids who have just used the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medicine or medical treatment can prevent or reduce disease spread.
The main purpose of hand-washing medicine is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacterics, viruses, or other organisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses, and other infectious diseases; preventing causes of contagious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infection;
And reduce infant mortality at home.
Studies carried out in 2013 showed that handwashing was a small increase in child height.
In developing countries, the number of infant mortality due to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate due to the disease to almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea to about one third; this can be done by providing clean water in low - handling areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea can be associated with handwashing with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and infection of acute breathing channels (ISPA), as a subconscious behavior done at home, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the primary ISPA, is the cause of the number one child's death; this disease causes the death of some 1.8 million children a year.
Diare and pneumonia cause almost 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using toilets can save more lives than any vaccine or medical action, and reducing die from diarrhea to nearly half and death from acute respiratory tract infection to half.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitary actions as part of the water program, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).
Washing your hands also protects yourself from impetigo that is transmitted through physical contact directly.
A small side effect washing hands is the frequent washing of hands that can cause skin damage as a result of skin thinning.
Studies conducted in Denmark in 2012 found that handwashing can cause an itch and cystic skin condition, known as hand or hand dermatitis, especially among health workers.
Washing hands too often is seen as one of the obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCDs).
There are five critical moments all day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the spread of fecal-oral disease, which is: before and after using the toilet, after cleaning the child's butt, before feeding the child, before eating and before/after feeding or cooking meat, fish, or raw garlic.
Another important time to apply the technique of washing the right hands to prevent the transmission of the disease is before and after treatment of the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal shit or treating the animal; and after touching the trash.
In many countries, the level of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practice soap washing. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest level of 97 percent; the United States almost in the middle of 77 percent; and Taiwan at the lowest level of 23 percent. Now some methodologies are available to improve behavioural adoptions of soap-washing behavior at critical times. Washing a group of hands for students at specified times is one of the options in developing countries to habitually wash hands in child behavior.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Education Department in the Philippines is an example of proper steps to support children’s health and education.
The twice-year supply of worm drugs, plus washing your hands every day with soap and binding your teeth every day with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
This program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Microorganism cleansing of the skin is reinforced by adding soap or detergent to water.
The main task of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to the oceans and increase the lateness.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because of the fat and protein, which is a component of organic waste, is not easily leaked into the water.
Despite this, fat and protein cleaning are supported by sufficient water flow.
Solid soap, because of its re-useable qualities, may contain bacteria obtained from the previous use.
A small number of studies investigating the transfer of contaminated solid soap bacteria concluded that the transfer could not occur because of the decayed bacteria.
Even so, the CDC continues to say "the liquid soap that comes out of the vessel without touching the hand is preferred."
Anti-coffee soap is widely promoted to a healthy society.
So far, there is no evidence that antiseptic or disinfection use recommended better for organisms that hold antibiotics in nature.
However, anti-bacterial soap contains a public fire agent such as a trickle, which has a list of foreign, long - held organisms.
So, even though the remaining antibiotic strain is not targeted by the anti-bacterial soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is.
In addition to surfactants and skin shielding substances, advanced formulations may contain acid (ascetic acid, ascorbate acid, latex acid) as pH organizers, benzoate as active antimicrobial acid, and more skin conditioners (coal tongue, vitamins, ointments, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon's Society Health Faculty shows that ordinary soap is equally effective with consumer-level antibacterial soap that contains a trickle in preventing disease and cleaning of bacteria from hand.
The warm water that is comfortable to wash your hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm water is more effective than cold water is used to eliminate natural oil that holds up dirt and bacteria.
However, turning back with the belief of many, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand-hand care or antiseptics are non-water-based hygiene agents.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, a hand-cleaning agent was a non-water-based drinker (also called an alcohol-based rubger, an antiseptic hand-washer, or hand-hand care) becoming known.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on alcohol or ethanol isopropyl, which is formulated together with substances such as carbonmer (acrylate acid polymer) to be gel or with moisture such as glycerin into liquid or foam to be easily used and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide incer increases further antimicrobial activity. Hand treatment containing at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Bacteria, bacteria resistant to many drugs (MSSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) and mushrooms.
Alcohol treatment containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log 3.5, similar to 35 decibel reduction) bacteria in hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in hand 1 minute after use. Hand care most effective against bacteria and not effective against some viruses.
Treatment of hands based on alcohol almost entirely is not effective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause for contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptic hands or sufficient alcohol squeezing should be used to water or cover two hands completely.
The front and back of the hands and in the arm and the end of all the fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds to liquid, foam, or dry gel.
The tip of the finger must also be washed thoroughly by rubbing it in two palms. The Center for Control and Prevention of the U.S. Disease recommends more handwashing instead of handwashing, especially when the hand looks dirty.
Improving the use of the service agent because of the ease of use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms; however, the service agent should not be used as a replacement for proper handwashing, except soap and water not available.
The use of alcohol-based hand-hand care can often cause dry skin, unless the emolynics and/or skin-folding are added to the formula.
Drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emoticons to formula.
In clinical trials, the treatment of alcohol-based hands that contain hemolynic causes irritation and skin dryness far lower than soap and antimicrobial detergent.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive in alcohol squeezing rarely occur.
The lower spirit causes dermatitis of contact that interferes with the pull of this product is compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents do not wash their hands from organic substances, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, the handwasher is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still in hand.
Honesty of freehand alcohol is highly dependent on its materials and formulations, and according to history, this product is significantly worse off than alcohol and alcoholics.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have proven to have a continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, not like alcohol, which is proven to be reduced after repeated use, perhaps due to progressive side effects.
Many people in the low - grade community are unable to buy soap and use ashes instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ashes may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfection agent because, if contact with water, ash will form alkali streams.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative soap when soap is not available.
Techniques washing hands properly based on the recommendation of the U.S. Disease Control Center to prevent disease transmission include the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold water flowing.
Water flows recommended because the closed baskom may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to be unaffected.
Put your hands around it with a lot of soap, including your back, on your fingers, and under your fingernails.
Soap lifts germs out of skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more accurately when using soap than when using water only.

Squirrels create symptoms, which help remove germs from the skin, and rub longer to remove more germs.

Brackishing in the Basque can cause contaminated hands to return.
Dry with dry lips or let it dry in the air.
Wet hands and wetness are easier to re-contaminate.
The unbleached nail and nail polish can store microorganisms.
Fertilized lotions are often recommended to keep hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate washing your hands when running water and/or soap is not available, for example, flowing water from the syringes or bottles that are hanging and holed and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as school or rural areas in developing countries), there are water solutions, such as "typy-tap", and other low-cost options.
Tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a water bottle hanging from a rope, a tutelage operated by the feet to pour a little water into the hands, and a soap.
Effective hand-drying is an important part of the hand-cleaning process, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand-drying in the public toilet.
The more research indicates that paper sheets are much cleaner than the electric dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and provided by the European Tissue Symposium lap industry, to compare the level of paper lap cleaning, warm air dryers, and more modern jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by about 194% in fingerbooks and 254% in palms.
Chasing with jet air dryers caused a total increase of 42% in the average number of bacteria in the finger books and 15% in the palm of the hand.
After washing and drying hands with a paper cover, the total number of bacteria decreases by 76% in the finger books and 77% in the palms.Scientists also perform tests to determine the potential of cross-contamination to other users of toilets and the environment due to each type of method of drying.
jet air dryer, which sprays the air from a unit at a speed claimed 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), capable of blowing microorganisms from hands and units and potentially contaminating other toilet users and toilet environment up to 2 meters.
The use of warm air dryers spread microorganisms up to 0,25 meters from dryers.
Paper cover does not show significant microorganism spread. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt, various methods of hand-reaching were evaluated.
After hand-drying, changes in the following number of bacteria are observed:
There are many hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to dryers using paper sheets.
Washing hands using hand treatment tissue is alternative during travel if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand treatment must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The washing of medical hands was required far after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There is an electronic device that provides feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection decreased with the use of the device.
Medical washing was done for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in numerous amounts or gels to kill and rub each part.
Hands have to be rubbed by each other with fingers bound.
If there's shit under the fingernails, the hairbrush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in the water in their hands, hands need to be thoroughly rinsed and dried with clean lips.
After dry matter, the sheet of paper was used to shut down the water tap (and open the door if needed).
This action avoids hand recontamination from the surface.
The aim of washing hands in the health care arrangement is to remove pathogen microorganisms ("the liver") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of washing hands is still at an unacceptable level in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patient and thus contaminating microorganisms.
One study shows that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can lower the level of blood flow infection linked to catheters to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing the standard of handwashing and shaking hands in the health care sector.
The WHO clean-up concept can also be seen on its website for public comment.
A relevant review by Whitby et al.
The commercial device can measure and validate hand hygiene if the demonstration of compliance with the necessary rules.
The World Health Organization has five moments to wash its hands:
after exposed to blood/body discharge
Before an aseptic task, and
After the patient's treatment, adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (the "medicine" or "antimicrobial" soap) was used to kill the washing material.
The kill function may be desired prior to surgery or in situations when the organism that holds antibiotics is very common. To 'clean' hands before the surgery, it is necessary to turn off and turn off without touching, chlorhexidine or iodium washing, sterile lap to dry hands after washing, and sterile brushes to rub and other sterile instruments to clean under the nails.
All the jewelry has to be released.
This procedure requires washing hands and arms down to elbows, usually 2–6 minutes.
It's not a long time to rub (10 minutes).
When dispersing, water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After the washing of hands, the hand is dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use the hand treatment before and after treating the sick.
For the control of staphyloccus infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand-cleaning comes from 20% first washing, and that the additional benefit obtained is very little when the frequency of hand-cleaning is increased above 35%.
Washing with soap usually results in more than three times the spread of infection to food compared to washing with anti-bacterial soap. The comparison between washing hands with alcohol-based laundering and washing hands with anti-bacterial soap at a median time of 30 seconds shows that the scrubbing of alcohol-based hands reduces the contamination of bacteria 26% more than the anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handwashers to reduce the A H1N1 influenza virus and difficult clostridium spores from the hands. Intervention to improve the hygiene of the hands in health care may involve education for staff about washing hands, increase the availability of alcohol-based handwashers, and written and licentious reminders to the staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective intervention in various health care settings.
In developing countries, washing their hands with soap is recognized as a basic way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand washing facilities in the homes of residents, schools, and workplaces points to universal handwashing behavior as a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, handwashing nets near private toilets or public toilets are rarely available, although options are available to create cheap toilets.
In any case, a low level of washing may also occur because of habits that have been planted and not because of lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and encouragement to wash your hands with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing your hands, and bring about changes in the behavior of the long - term population.
For effective walking, monitoring and evaluation are required.
Systematic reviews of 70 studies found that an effective community-based approach to improving handwashing in LMIC, while social marketing campaign was not effective. One example of school-based handwashing was "The Three Star Approaches" by UNICEF that encouraged the school to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students washed their hands with soap, among other requirements of cleanliness.
When the minimum standards are reached, the school can move from one star to finally three stars.
Building a washroom can be part of a hand - washing campaign to reduce the disease and death of a child.
The World’s Hands Washing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve the purpose of changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 Crown Virus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of hand-washing emoji.
Some studies investigate the effectiveness of the overall cost of washing hands in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the year lost to illness.
One survey shows that encouraging soap-washing is significantly more cost-effective than water intervention and other sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as a newborn mother or a wounded army in the hospital, first known in the mid-19th century by two cleaning agents: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "modern care workers" in England.
At that time, many people still believed that infection was caused by a rotten odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, a plague that was transmitted through food and infections related to health care made the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases more active stimulates hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 pig flu epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increased awareness in many countries will be important to wash hands with soap to protect themselves from the contagious disease.
For example, the poster "the proper hand-washing technique" is hung next to the washbasin in the public toilet and in the office and airport toilets in Germany.
The word "washing hands from" means declaring someone's denial to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
That statement comes from a Bible chapter in Matthew’s book when Pontius Pilate washed his hands with the decision to enslave Jesus Christ, but it has been widely used in the English community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash his hands constantly to cleanse the imaginary stain; an act that showed his guilt for the crime he did and had persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate them more when washing their hands.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation have a lesser degree of purity involved in "cleaning" compensation, such as volunteering.
Religion commands the washing of hands for the purpose of cleanliness and symbolism. The washing of symbolic hands, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is the ritual portion of washing hands in many religions, including the Bahá'í faith, Hindus, Havilah and Yadayim in Jews, Lavabo in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hindu religion, Jews, and Islam are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
Moreover, Hindu religion, Buddha, Sikh, Jews, and Islam required the washing of hands before and after eating.
Hazard control for COVID-19
The dangerous control of the workplace for COVID-19 is the use of safety and occupational health methodologies for risk control for the prevention of 2019 kronovirus disease (COVID-19).
The proper management of the workplace depends on the location and work, based on the risk assessment of the sources of disease, the level of disease in society, and the risk of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work has minimal contact with the public and other workmates; for this work, it is encouraged to take steps to prevent basic infections, which include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics, and doing cleaning and disinfecting work routinely.
Jobs at risk include jobs that require close or often contact with people who are unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected by the spread of current or international travel communities.
This group includes workers who have contact with public society such as at school, the working environment with high population density, and high volume ritual setting.
Risk control for this group, in addition to the basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high efficiency air filters, sine protectors, and providing self-protection tools when encountering the COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers that health and morgue that is exposed to people who are known or expected to suffer from COVID-19 at high risk, which increases the risk of high exposure if workers perform an aerosol production procedure on, or take or handle specimens from, people who are known or expected to suffer from COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard control for these workers includes technical control, such as a negative pressure ventilator room, and self-protection device that fits the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some effects on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or they may be afraid of a job.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and how to obtain these items (such as shopping outside busy hours, by delivery, or upgrade).
In the end, shipments of items from the highly affected geographic region of the COVID-19 can be disrupted. The disease-repair and disease-repair plans can be used to guide the protection action.
The article considers the risks associated with various workplaces and jobs, includes the sources of waste management, the risk factors arising from home and society arrangements, and the risk factors of each worker, such as age or chronic medical condition.
The article also outlines the necessary control to deal with the risk and the emergency for situations that may arise as a result of the plague.
Sexiness and the plan for the removal of contagious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goal of the outbreak involves reducing the spread of staff, protecting those at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the adverse effect on other entities in supply chains.
The level of disease in the community where the business is affected by the act of retaliation taken.
The risk control hierarchy is a work framework that is widely used in safety and health work to collect the risk control based on its effectiveness.
When the danger of the COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last protective tool.
Technical control includes the isolation of employees from the hazards associated with work without relying on the behavior of workers and can be the most costly solution to implement.
Administrative handling is a change in the policy or employment procedures that require the action of workers or employers.
Self - protection (ODA) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative control, but can help prevent some of them.
All types of ODA should be selected on the basis of risks to the workers, correctly installed as (e.g., respiratory), consistently and correctly worn, checked, treated, and replaced on a time basis, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low - risk jobs have minimal contact with the public and other workmates.
The recommended basic infection prevention steps for all workplaces include often washing hands carefully, encouraging workers to stay at home if ill, breathing ethics includes covering the cough and the ashes, providing a network and garbage vessel, preparing work from a distance or shift of work at a time of arrival/return, if necessary, informing workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and doing regular cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Fast identification and isolation against potentially transmitted individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free of fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever reduction or other symptoms, and that the policy of flexible sick leave permits workers to stay at home to care for sick family members, and that employees know this policy.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk include jobs that require close contact or often within six feet (1,8 meters) with people who are unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of public transmission around the business location, or because someone has recently made an international journey to the location with a wide-ranging COVID-19 transmission.
This group includes workers who have contact with public communities such as at school, working environment with high population density, and high volume requirements. Technical skills for this group and high risk group include setting up a high risk group, including a high risk group of employees who have contact with general community communities such as at school, working environment with high population density, and setting up high-population environments. Technical technical controls for this group and high risk group include installing high risk groups of installing high-risk groups of air filters for high efficiency efficiency air air filters, increasing ventilation levels, increasing the level of ventilation levels, installing physical barriers such as sleep-guarding plastics, and installing windows of wheeled guards, and installing windows of windows or heights for customer service services. Administrative controls for this group and high risk groups include installing high risk groups including high risk groups of high risk groups, including high risk groups including high risk groups including high risk groups such as at school, increasing the level of the general use of this group, increasing working conditions such as high population groups, and high population environments, and high volume groups of these groups, and high volume sets of high volume structures.

Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers includes separating the sick from another person at 6 feet, pointing one cabin crew to take care of the sick, and offering masks to the sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear once and for all medical gloves when caring for sick passengers or touching contaminated body fluid or surface and perhaps other protective devices if the sick passenger has fever, coughing constantly, or breathing difficulties.
The gloves and the other items should be disposed of in the life-threatening bag, and the contaminated surface should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.
Ideally, further medical action is done in the cabin of people in isolation. Apart from the public distribution, for schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if infected people have ever been in the school building.
If there is a public transmission at the minimum level until now, the social limitation strategy can be applied, which includes: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, voice pooling classes, or eating at the cafeteria, increasing the distance between tables, arrival times and gradual return, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health offices locations for children with similar flu symptoms.
If there is a high spread in local society, in addition to a social restriction strategy, extending the school closure can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
The law enforcement officer who has to contact confirmed or expected COVID-19 was recommended to follow the same guidance as the emergency medical technician, including the appropriate use of self-protection.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect the belt and task equipment before they are used again by using a household spray or cleaning lap and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of old APDs and to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue are at high or very high risk.
High risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation services that are exposed to known or expected COVID-19 patients.
This job is a very high risk if workers perform an aerosol income procedure on, or take or deal with the specimens of, known or expected COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronkoscopes, some procedures and dental examinations, or the removal of invasive specimens.
High risk morgue work involves workers involved in preparing bodies of known or suspected COVID-19 cases at death; this job is at risk of very high repair if the workers perform an autopsy. Additional technical control for this risk group includes an isolated room for known or expected COVID-19 patients, including when the aerosol result procedure is performed.
Ventilation of special negative pressure may be appropriate in some settings of health care and morgue.
Specimen must be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come into a separate room be separated into a different waiting room based on whether they are expected to be the COVID-19 case. In addition to other OSHA cases, OSHA recommends a respirator for those who work within 6 feet of known patients or are suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the person who performs an aerosol revenue procedure.
In the United States, N95 approved NIOSH filter facial respiratory system or better should be used in the context of written and comprehensive breathing protection programs that include fitness tests, training, and medical examinations.
Another type of respirator can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the workers. WHO does not recommend clothing completely closed or coverall because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not transmitted through body fluid.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for the screening officer at the entrance point.
For those taking breathing specimens, caring, or transporting patients COVID-19 without an aerosol production procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, robes, and gloves.
If the aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by the N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Considering that ODA supply is not sufficient throughout the world, WHO recommends minimizing ODA needs through long-distance medical services, physical barrier such as a glance window, with only people involved in immediate care can enter the room containing the COPID-19 patients, use only the necessary ODA for specific tasks, continue to use the same respirator without releasing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnostics, monitoring and ordinating the chain of ODA supply, and do not encourage the use of masks for people without symptoms.

SUBSTANCE: [Covid-19] Soften the burden and prepare the future
TANGGAL/WATER: March 14, 2020, 00:00 UTC
LIST: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes it clear the global human relationship and the responsibility we have to each other.
We have never faced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the building of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've witnessed among all our coworkers through email, calls, and talks are an extraordinary validation of extraordinary human beings, which we're lucky enough to work with.
I am so grateful and proud that I can call you my fellow worker.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how much it is for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how this is a powerful symbol for this important resource to remain available to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, either you make sure this site keeps running, helps pay our partners, or helps keep our community safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially at this time.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work schedule and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was an accurate response to the challenges we faced and the best way to maintain the organization’s survival during this time.
We really want to get rid of the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice is made.
We don't set holidays, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted at this time, and either you need to care for the loved ones, shop for the needs of the trees, or go to the doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your working time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This shouldn't have been said, but we said it.
Sick leave or PTO is not necessary, just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure the main work areas can be resolved.
(If you are diagnosed positively with CVID-19, please tell Bryan in the T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the right attention from management).
Companions whose wages are based on hours will be paid full.
We've said it, and said it again, to respect our commitment to the contractors' partners and the clock-based staff.
All people will be paid according to their normal working hours.
It's included if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their work as a way to fuel the stress of the world around us.
Our work can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Once again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Confidence & Security, and the Dana Learning team, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all the departments to assess our current goals and divert our focus to support the essentials of our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus full on the most essential project.
Slowing down right now will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning on "working late" after this pandemic has passed.
You wouldn't be expected to work late to meet the unrealistic length of time right now.
We realize that the situation has changed and will try to set a new target and timeline if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adjust to the new reality and the day - to - day work schedule, we meant adjusting the time line for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Year Plan.
We mean to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make budgets so that employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and the care of loved ones while adapting their needs or wanting to work with fewer schedules for the next few weeks.
The length of this time line greatly reduces the workload and current planning pressures throughout the organization.
We'll deliver our proposal to the Council next week and update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, placement, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our partners based on SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great concern, we hired an anti-virus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They're using hospital-based antiviral fluids to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
The buildings apply their own safety control protocol by using products that support the safety of their tenants.
We were happy that the office would be ready to use when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has distributed the COVID-19 protocol to us and all the DC-based staff members.
As of last week, our DC office has moved to a long-range work order, along with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our fellow NYC-based colleagues know, we're also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work from a distance for the first time.
Our long-working colleagues realize that it may require adjustments and they want to give you advice:
The longest meeting time limit is one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into days.
Define a meeting clearly, on a schedule, and send out previous publications.
Make video as default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Show the leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor conversations for questions and records the list of speakers, and someone to help make a meeting record (or make a collaborative note).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy little food.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to his colleagues about the shared work
SDM Operations Team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to support the increase of distributed jobs across the Foundation.
Last week we asked all funders to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic is over.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make them unable to complete the approved activities and that no one would be given a stipend because they had to postpone or modify the target.
This week we will continue with additional guidelines on Wikimania and the regional and other thematic community conferences.
Generally speaking, feelings from all over the global community seem to be a sadness over these disturbances, but at the same time relief from clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is trying to prepare a page at Meta-Wiki to provide community space to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Thursday coming, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and make time to connect.
We're in this situation together and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all the essential information related to COVID-19 other at Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all information is in one place.
We also try to keep regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, the main course of work, or difficulties about the performance, or other things that may require help, do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and be a link as needed.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operation International SDM.
None of these changes are seen as a burden to our work and duty.
On the other hand, this change is a recognition that our work and our obligations may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These are the steps we are confident of important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support for our movement, and give the world the services they rely on.
The work we planned earlier will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and create space for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months to come.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work as well as you need.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Enzym angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has an activity that is opposed to an angiotensin reverse enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also functions as a point of entry into the cell for some coronavirus.
ACE2 human versions are often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 reverse enzymes are metalloenzyme containing seng located on the surface of endothel cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein has M2 terminal-N peptidease domain and domain transporter amino renal acid collectrin terminal-C domain.
ACE2 is a single type I passing membrane protein, with an enzyme-active domain found on the surface of cells in the lungs and other networks.
The ACE2 extrasel domain is separated from the domain transmegran by another enzyme, known as the sheeddase, and the late protein produced is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membranes, especially type II alveolar membranes, small intestine enterocytes, arteritus endothel cells and veins, and pulmonary muscle cells in most organs.
MRNA ACE2 expression was also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
ACE2's main function is as an ACE measurer.
ACE splits angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cut off amino phenylalanine carboxyl terminal acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides include [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, orange, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also arranges traffic of the membrane transporter amino neutral acid SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmember protein, ACE2 functions as a main entry point into the cell for some coronavirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (sars-cause virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (saws-cause virus-COVID-19).
More specifically, S1 protein binding on spikes or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 enhancements with ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface results in endotosis and virus and enzyme transfer into endosomals located in the cells.
The process of entering this virus also requires the primary protein S by a series of TMPRSS2 proteases, which are currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesized that lowering the ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE and ARB standard inhibitors.
A systematic and meta-analysis review, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors causes a significant decrease of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients at higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with decreased mortality associated with pneumonia, although the result is less powerful than the risk of overall pneumonia."
ACE2 humans recommendation (rhACE2) is expected to be new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipoplysaccharide.
Half-time rhACE2 on humans is about 10 hours with workouts 30 minutes apart from 24 hours long (duration) effects.
Some findings show that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance against classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or an angiotensin II disease in increased blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory syndrome.
b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts to overcome the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people who may have made contact with those who are infected.
Many applications are developed or promulgated, which have official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Some skeletons to build a contact tracking application have been developed.
The problem of privacy is questioned, especially related to the system based on the geographic location of the application user.
Alternatives that do not oversupply privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to another phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionalities to support those Bluetooth-based applications directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed applications that allow citizens to check if they have contacted the COVID-19 sufferer.
This application is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, it uses an application called TraceTogether.
This application is developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be delivered to the government. Northern Macedonia launches "StopCorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track awareness of people who may be infected and respond quickly to health care authorities.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the application is still waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store approval.
On 12 April, the government stated that a contact tracking application is in further development and will be available for distribution within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singaporea and BlueTrace protocols. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur on the application-based system, which includes false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if the data taken is limited to only a few populations.
To address concerns about the spread of a misleading or dangerous "coronavirus" application, Apple sets limits on the kind of organization that can add the most connected corronavirus applications to the App Store, that is to limit only for a "remi" organization or that has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply similar restrictions.
Private supporters express their concern about the involvement of mass surveillance using a coronavirus application, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure that is designed to handle the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after a threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements that limit this kind of surveillance.
This organization states eight conditions on the government project:
surveillance must be "according to law, necessary, and proportionate";
the range of observation and surveillance must have the sun's rays set;
data usage must be restricted for the purpose of COVID-19;
data security and anonymity shall be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid more severe discrimination and marginalization;
each data divider with the third party must be defined in the laws;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The participation means all of my "relevant interests" required, including the health experts of society and the marginalized group. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) German and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan means to solve the surveillance problem by constantly removing tracking mechanisms from the device operating system after it is no longer necessary.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, not applications, thus eliminating the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
A network-based solution that has access to raw location data has significant privacy potential.
However, not all systems with the central server need access to personal location data; a number of privacy-protected systems have been created and use the central server only for intercom (see below).
In South Korea, a non-based system used to track contacts.
Instead of using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to produce notification through text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes information available to the general public, which is permitted with widespread changes in the privacy laws of the information after it is fired by MERS in the country.
This information is available for public use through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using the core system while protecting privacy.
By 6 April 2020, the details are not yet available.
Privacy-protected contacts are a well-founded concept, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts working on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user proximity to another phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralised approach, and is not a single protocol. The centralized protocol includes tracking of Decentralised Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called Contact Genesis Number, CEN), Protocols and Sensitive Privacy Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, a platform to use a technique that protects privacy when collecting and using a range location or intersection data to track the COVID-19 release.
This is based on a study of the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.Other similar works are the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology and was also established in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and officers without sacrificing the data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, global NCT co-analysis was established by groups with basically the same approaches and is a highly advanced protocol, with a view to reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a major aspect of reaching wide acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government applications an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative for tracking contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of Low Energy Bluetooth technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also published the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be launched in three stages:
Launching the tool to allow the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
The integration of this function directly to iOS and Android Google and Apple are planning to solve data collection and monitoring problems by continuing to distribute the system at first by updating the operating system, and then eliminate it in the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Reposition medicine (also called a new target gift, a new profile, or a new task in medicine or therapy transfer) is a drug that has been approved for a new treatment purpose, i.e. for a disease or medical condition different from the original purpose of drug development.
This path is a scientific study path that is currently being carried out to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
The other direction of research includes development of the COVID-19 vaccine and convalesen plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several binding sites.
Analysis of the linkage sites can be the basis for the development of effective antiviral drugs against the COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papal-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribofosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al studied a number of candidates that were later optimized and analyzed their species similarity with the drugs approved and had the highest level of nutrition to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 poten drugs in their clinical studies to recommend in the clinical study design.
Chlorokuin is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chlorocuin and hydrochlorokuin related are two of the four drugs that will be tested as part of the Solidaritic Clinical Trial.
Governor New York, Andrew Como, announced that chlorocuin and hydrochlorokuin tests in New York will begin on March 24. On March 28, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorokuin sulphate and phosphate chlorokuin based on Authorization of Emergency Use (USA).
This medicine has not yet been approved by the FDA clinical trial and U.S.-based authorization only as an experimental medicine for emergency use in patients who are not treated, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "use, dose, or duration of hydroxychlorokuin for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been set.
The doctor says they use that medicine when "no other choice".
A Turkish team of researchers in Istanbul is doing a small study on the use of chlorocuine combined with seng, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are being conducted at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and safety test and an honest use of hydroxychlorokuin prevention.
The Chinese clinical trial in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved to be "effectively clear".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within four days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the medication.
In a study carried out in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Board reminded the public that there was evidence to support the medicine little and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan for supplies and use the military to send drugs to a university hospital, where drugs would be used to treat patients with CVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to Trump's government on the purchase of the drug, which may not be effective in cases of a major multiple virus disease.
This medicine may not be safe if used by a pregnant mother or a person trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirus, concluded that "there is no significant benefit".
This medicine is designed to prevent the replication of HIV by binding proteases.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that will match the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in scientific society about resource referrals to respond to drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in international Solidarity Tests.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Then Gilead Sciences discovered that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activities against several wires, pneumo-, paramiko-, and corronavirus.
One of the problems with anti-virus treatment is resistance through mutations that can cause more severe diseases and transmissions.
Some early test studies show that remdesivir may have high genetic resistance restrictions. There are some ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials performed by the University of Cleveland Hospital, one for people with an ongoing disease and one for those with a severe disease.
There are three clinical trials being carried out for intravenous vitamin C for people who are ill and have severe COVID-19, namely two controlled plasebones (Tiokok, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began testing for azithromisin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Health and Global Medicine Center (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (cyclesonide) Teijin, korticosteroid inhalation for asthma, for a new presymtomatic coronavirus infection patient.
For a form of angiotensin 2 reversing enzyme, Phase II testing is going on with 200 patients will be recruited from a severe case that has been neglected in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to find out how effective treatment is.
Researchers from Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently examining the role of collkisin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with CVID-19 and had mild symptoms so as not to require inhalation.
Women who are pregnant or breast - feeding or do not use effective contraception methods do not qualify.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low - molecular heparin is often used to treat patients so as to motivate the Italian Medicines Authority to publish guidelines on their use.
A multicentered study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoksaparin sodium at a dose of prophylaxis and therapeutics was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention is focused on giving new treatment purpose to approved antiviral drugs and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th edition
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to Tiokok's 7th edition
Some antibiotics identified potentially as drugs that can be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-responsor IL-6): Approved by Tiokkok.
In addition, testing is also done in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaksin COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed the clinical trial, there is a lot of effort being made to develop the vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the kausatif virus of this disease, would not be available within 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in Phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The major plague spread throughout the world in 2020, which led to major investment and research to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop vaccines that might be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative stated in April that the thing to be observed in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, distribution at the required scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI reported that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development for early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform target advanced to Phase I security studies, includes:
nucleat acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I promoter and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (phase I controller and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by ECPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered as being in planning or being planned).
Phase I-II test performed early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually done at random, controlled placebo, and at some locations, while determining the most appropriate effective dose.
Phase III test usually involves more participants, including control groups, and tests the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 of them have not been in human evaluation (in particular in "praclinis" research).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential of molecular tightening vaccines that would genetically modify the virus protein to stimulate immune reactions.

in the development and development of vaccines.
Further, this partnership announced a clinical trial and clinical trial plan Phase I in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working 11 blocks away, and even on the fast track, the development of vaccines took at least one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported a particle development similar to coronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human testing planned in July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian reported that the U.S. President Donald Trump had offered "'a large amount of money' for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, which the German government had protected.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced partnership with the German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop mRNA-based vaccines.
Currently, vaccine candidates based on mRNA, BNT162, are in a clinical trial with the expected clinical trial will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech firm Takis Biotech announced that they would receive results of clinical testing in April 2020 and vaccine candidates at the final stage could start testing on humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Innovation Coalition of Epidemic Asia (CEPI) announced a total investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and Pittsburgh University, with a total investment of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, reaching $29 million.
Another ECI investment partner for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russia's health officer announced that scientists have started six vaccine candidates testing on animals.
Imperial College London's researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing RNA vaccines that can self-accomplish for COVID-19.
Vaccine candidates were developed within 14 days after receiving follow-up from China.
By the end of March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 medically-restraint projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced a special C$192 million funding to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccin bank" containing some new vaccines that can be used if another coronavirus disease occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported the PittCoVacc test, the candidate of the COVID-19 vaccine, on mice; they stated that "MNA that gave subunit S1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine produces a specific antibode response that may occur [on mice] starting to appear 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the Faculty of Pharmacy Waterloo University announced the design of DNA-based vaccine candidates as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce such harmless particles that can stimulate immune systems to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, governments, industries, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, which are also called nonspecific effects.
It means that these vaccines can benefit beyond his preventable disease.
Further studies in Australia are attempting to follow up with 4,170 health officers.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess vaccine honesty using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, shows the need for step-by-step safeguards to reach biological safety levels in dealing with living viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on a non-human animal model.
By 2020, no protective drugs or vaccines for SARS proved safe and effective in humans.
According to the research published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and health institutions around the world.
When MERS becomes prevalent, an established SARS study can be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatment against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed Phase I clinical trial in humans, and three other vaccines were in process, all of which were viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVA), and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts support conspiracy theory claiming viruses behind COVID-19 have been known before and that vaccines are available.
The patents quoted by various social media posts refer to patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus, such as coronavirus SARS.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by acute acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and dry breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
Time from exposure to symptoms usually takes about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some develop into virus pneumonia and fail in the mucus.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, and this virus is mainly spreading inter-manufactured when there is close contact, often through sparks or small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
Despite the results of breathing, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and do not spread far.
People can also be infected by touching the contaminated surface and touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is highly contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although circulation may occur before the symptoms appear and after the next stage of disease. The standard diagnostic method is with the reaction of the polymerase chain transcription back real-time (rRT-PCR) on the nasofaring strain.
The use of masks is encouraged for those suspected virus infected and caregivers.
Recommendation on the use of masks by different public authorities; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend its use, and others require its use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific anti-virus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People who are infected with the virus may have no symptoms or symptoms such as flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or asphyxiation in the chest, confusion, difficulty getting up, and face or lips; medical withdrawal is immediately recommended if these symptoms appear.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sininating, swallowing, or sore throat, can be found, but more rarely.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in multiple percentages.
Some cases in the early Chinese only with clinical descriptions of the chest and palpitation.
For some, disease can develop into pneumonia, failure to perform mosquitoes, and death.
This time is called a time of incubation.
The incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people on the rise will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Report shows that not all people on the road will experience symptoms.
The role of this untimely carrier in the transmission is yet to be fully understood; however, early evidence shows that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show unrecognized symptoms and are being investigated, with the Korean Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remain unacquainted during treatment in the hospital.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to report cases without symptoms in its daily case on April 1st; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and mud water can carry the virus load on a large scale.
Speaking up with the loud release of more sparks or droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can cause droplets up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not airborne, the United States National Science Academy has shown that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air receptacles placed in the corridors outside the room produce a positive sample for RNA viruses.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make breathing secretes turn into aerosol and spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the fesses, this risk is believed to be low.
European Disease Control and Prevention Center (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others. This virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
Specifically, it was found that viruses can be detected for one day on cards/cards, up to three days on plastic (polypropylen) and solid steel (AIS 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective when used properly; soap products describe the thickness of the virus protector, deactivate the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other streams, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glukonate (surgery disinfection), are not effective. In a study in Hong Kong, samples of lute water were taken in the median two days after incubation began.
In five out of six patients, the first sample shows the highest virus load, and the sixth patient shows the highest virus load on the second day test.
Koronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute breathing syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the classer case acute breathing disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features on the coronavirus that is related to nature.
Outside of the human body, this virus was killed by household soap, which damaged the protective bubble.
The lung is the most affected organ by the COVID-19 because the virus accesses the angina cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzymes, the most abundant in type II lung alveolar cells.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spice or pitch" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter angina cells.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of infected people treated poorly in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe disease.
High level of cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute miokard injuries may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very highly in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
The high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and vena thromboembolism (25%) were found in patients with COVID-19 infection in the ICU and may be associated with bad prognosis. Autopsy in those who died because of COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and infiltrate inflammation that contains lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for respiratory epithel cells that express ACE2, patients with heavy COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
Specifically, T-cells that secrete GM-CSF pathogenic have proven to correlate with monosites that secrete IL-6 inflammatory and severe lung pathology on the COVID-19 patient.
Lymphosytic infiltration has also been reported on autopsy.
WHO has published some testing protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is the reaction of the polymerase chain real-time transcription (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on a breathing sample obtained through a nasopharynx; however, a nasal or sputum sample can also be used.
Generally, results are available within hours to two days.
Blood testing may be used, but it requires two samples taken within two weeks so that the result has a small amount of time.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus gallus and release its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop independently polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, an antibody test (which can detect active infections and if someone has previously infected) is in development, but not widely used.
The experience of the test in China shows that only 60 to 70% are required.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidance released by Zhongnan Hospital University Wuhan suggests methods to detect infections based on clinical images and epidemiological risks.
The wide-glass bilateral multilobar opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetric, and posterior much found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy Paving (the yield of the lobular septum with a variety of alveolar fillings), and consolidation can occur as disease develops.
A little data is available on microscopic and pathophysiological lesions COVID-19.
The main pathological finding in autopsy is:
Makroscopy: pleurisis, pericarditis, lung consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of immune pneumonia can be observed:
lightweight pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumosis hyperplasia, large atypis pneumosis, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of giant cells are very intense
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar ecstasy.
DAD is the cause of acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: high levels of alveolar gland and interstitial fibrosis lunger
Blood: intravascular coagulation is demonstrated (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommending use of the inner elbow if the tissue is not available.
Hygiene hands that match after coughing or sneezing are encouraged.
The CDC recommends that the use of fabric closures in public places, partly to limit transmission by people without symptoms. The social limitation strategy aims to reduce contact with people infected with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public.
Limitation also includes keeping at least six feet [6 or 1.8 m] away.
There is no known effective drug to prevent the CVID-19.Because vaccines are not anticipated until early 2021, the main part of the treatment of the CVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak epidemic, which is known as "coupling the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet or when their hands are dirty, before eating, and after a nose, cough, or sneeze.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand-hand care that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand-hand care is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help eliminate bacteria spores in alcohol; this substance is "not active substance for hand antiseptics".
Glyserol added as moisture.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommended that the people who suspected them carry the virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to deal with respiratory failure issues, but the benefit is still considered.
Self-sanity and lifestyle and healthy eating patterns are recommended to increase immunity.
Supportive care may be useful to people with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for treating the NIVID-19 sufferer who has been inhaled.
Intensive care professionals and lung experts in the U.S. have developed recommendations for care from various agencies into free resources, i.e. IBM.
Until April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical powers recommend paraetamol (asetaminofen) compared to ibuprofen for first line use.
Caution should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health care that treats the COVID-19 sufferer, the CDC recommends placing the person in the U.S. Tullar-Air Infection Isolation Room (IAIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact prevention actions, and tullar prevention actions. The CDC describes the guidance for the use of self-protection tools (APD) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: APD clothing, breathing or facial masks, eye protectors, and medical gloves. If available, respirators are not better.
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial control, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used based on the US Emergency Use Authorization.
The N95 respirator is designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified use in the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using a facial shield or, as the last effort, an artificial mask.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some are very heavy.
The type of breathing support for people who have failed to breathe linked to the COVID-19 is active being tested for people who are not treated, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-flow nasal canal or bipositive air pressure.
Not yet known whether one of these two methods yields the same benefit to those who are critically ill.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flowing nasal canulas. Heavy cases occur more in older people (aged over 60, and especially those over 80).
Many advanced countries have no adequate hospital bed per captain, which limits the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases so that it requires inhalation.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the COVID-19 patients who were treated barely finally entered the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated with acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) occurring on the COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators capable of doing pressure control mode and high PEEP required to maximize oxygen delivery at once minimize the risk of lung injury and ventilator-related pneumothoracs.
High PEEP may not be available on the old fan.
Research on treatment potential started in January 2020 and some anti-virus drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drug development may take up to 2021, some currently tested drugs have been approved for other uses or are in further testing.
Antivirus drugs can be tested on people with severe disease.
The volunteers who recommend the WHO also participate in the testing of potential efficacy and safety. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation for convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in the case of a person's life very or threatened.
Plasma convalesen has not yet undergone a clinical study needed to prove its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, Turkey launched a mobile application to deal with the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This application can detect 'near contak' using surveillance data so it can detect the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-recommendation but also informs local health officers. Analyzes data on phone data, facial recognition technology, cell tracking, and artificial intelligence used to track the infected and those who are in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security agency to track the phone numbers of suspected corrupters.
It was taken to do quarantine and protect people who might be contacted by infected citizens.
Furthermore, in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom shared aggregated phone site data with the German federal government body, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of viruses.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Regional Health Commissioner Italy, Giulio Gallera, said he was told the cell operator that "40% people are still moving places".
The German government had a 48-hour hack at the end of the weekend with over 42,000 people.
Furthermore, President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for a creative solution against the choronavirus circulation.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection themselves.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Raising social isolation, loneliness, anxiety of health, stress, and economic decline is a perfect storm that endangers mental health and the well-being of society."
This disease can be mild with a little or no symptoms, which resembles other general respiratory diseases, such as seizures.
Mild cases usually heal in two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical illness may need three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still less. In some people, COVID-19 can influence lung to cause pneumonia.
In the worst affected, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or failure of the mosquito system.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood pressure, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and heart.
Blood clotting disorders, especially an increase in prothrombin time, are observed in 6% of patients who have been treated inhaled, while kidney function disorders are seen in 4% of these groups.
About 20-30% of people with the COVID-19 image show an increase in heart enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in inhalation.
However, the patient who was transferred to the ICU has a median of seven days between inept ratios and death.
In a study that investigates early cases, the median time from early symptoms to death is 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, men have 2.8% death figures, while women have 1.7% death figures.
Histopathological examination of the postmortem lung sample shows diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Changes in cytopathic viruses observed on pneumocytes.
Artichokes resemble acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage is observed, with an increase in troponin levels or a stop in the heart.
According to the March data from the United States, 89% of people who are not treated have a stable condition, and the availability of medical and social economic resources in an area can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary because of the difference in the region, but also because of methodological difficulties.
Fewer case calculations can cause the death rate to be too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean the current mortality rate is too low.
Perocuk has the possibility of 1.4 times more severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from disease, and lung screening showed organ damage.
It can also cause an intensive-transmission syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it is not known whether previous infections give effective and long-term immunity to people who are cured of this disease.
Immunities may be obtained, if you look at another coronavirus behavior, but have been reported case recovery COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days later.
This case is believed to be the worst remaining infection, and not the re-infection.
This virus is supposed to be natural and comes from animals, through widespread infections.
The fact is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human transmission to humans.
A study of 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest warning date of December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported early warning symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
It varies according to region and time, and is influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time from the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO set the ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed laboratory and U07.2 for death due to COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Death ratio against case reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to the statistics of the Johns Hopkins University, the death ratio for the case overall is 6.9% (153,822/2.240,191) by 17 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region. Other measurements include the number of fatalities in the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed who died of certain diseases, and the number of fatalities in the infection (IFR), which reflect the percentage of those infected (diagnosis and non-diagnosis) who died of certain diseases.
This statistic is not time-bound and follows a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not everyone who is infected makes antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people who have been infected.
In the outbreak epicenter in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) is already dead.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread through the Karnaval festival, which spread among young people, causing relatively low mortality, and probably not all of the COVID-19 deaths classified as the COVID-19 death.
Moreover, the German health system had not yet come under control.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as examined by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) died because of COVID-19.
The pandemic and mortality levels are different for both men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with a different risk between new men and women not seen at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The obvious reason for this type of gender is unknown, but genetic factors and behavior may be an excuse.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, are younger than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people are men and 72% die because of COVID-19 is men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infection.
Studies indicate that virus diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of health workers with a higher gender type, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
Leader WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is the abbreviation for crown, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time identified plague: 31 December 2019.
It is chosen to avoid references to specific geographic locations (e.g., Tiokokkok), animal species, or a group of people, running with international recommendations for stigmatization prevention. Virus that causes COVID-19 is given the name of coronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both disease and the common virus are called koronavirus.
At the beginning of the plague in Wuhan, China, this virus and disease are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCov acute breathing disease as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to the 2015 guidelines that do not use the location name in the name of the disease and virus.
The official name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limited capacity in standard supply chains, some digital producers print health care materials such as nasal valves and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital really needed ventilator valves, and the supplier couldn't give in the required timescale, a local company was turned around and printed 100 valves needed in the last night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and information appeared on the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of replication of the virus on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no drug or vaccine approved to cure this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization practiced "Solidarity Trial" to examine the effects of four existing anti-virus compounds with the most promising honesty.
Vaccines are not available yet, but various institutions are active in developing vaccine candidates.
Previous study of SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, researchers aim to make a whole virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, either an inactive or dead virus, is intended to trigger a rapid human body immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
Second strategy, subunit vaccine, designed to create vaccines that create immune sensitive systems against certain subunits in viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on S-spike protein that helps virus absorb ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique to create vaccination).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies must be tested to find out the security and safety of the vaccine. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code that is copied from a virus that causes disease. The dependent-antibodies increase has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials in April 2020.
Seven tests have to assess the approved treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychlorocuin or chlorocuin.
The newly targeted antiviral drugs formed most of the research in China, with nine Phase III tests on redesivir in some countries with an estimated reporting time at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidate and CVID-19 drug exists.Some existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, which include remdecivir, chlorokin and hydroxychlorokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for remdecivir honesty.
Clinical increases are observed in patients treated with redesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trial is being performed in the United States, China, and Italy. Chlorokuin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with early results.
However, there is a call for a formal examination of the research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend chlorocuine use.
However, Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice the dose is very dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation for hydroxychlorokuin and chlorokuin on the policies of a doctor who cared for the patients of the COVID-19.The 7th edition of the Tiokokdomen also included interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against the COVID-19.
Initial data show that a high dose of ribavirin is required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo study after showing low concentration SARS-CoV-2 swiveling. Research shows that early principles against protein thinning by serin protease transmembrane 2 (TMPRSS2) are very important to enter SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chlorokine and hydroxychlorokuin with or without azithromycin have large limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Complication of the sitokin storm can occur on the COVID-19 weight further.
There is evidence that hydroxychlorokuin may have an antisitokin character. Tocilizumab has been placed in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study is completed.
This drug is being tested phase 2 at the national level in Italy after showing positive results for people with severe diseases.
Combined with the ferritin blood test serum to identify the cytokine storm, this medicine is intended to fight the cytokine storm, which is expected to cause death to some affected people.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of cytokine steroid refracter-lowering syndrome induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there's no random and controlled evidence that shows that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer the refined and bonded antibodies produced by the human system that has recovered from the COVID-19 to those who need it is being studied as a method of passive nonvaccin immunization.
This strategy is tested for SARS with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a working mechanism that is expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular sitotoxicity that depends on antibodies and/or phagositosis, may as well.
Another passive antibiotic therapy form, for example, using the produced monochlonal antibodies, is being developed.
Convalesen serum production, which is part of the fluid of the patient's healing blood and contains specific antibodies against this virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronavius, a group of closely associated syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Center Hospital, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after showing awareness of the virus spread.
