Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American president of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a full schedule.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who selected him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, but only the third one who will be awarded the prize in the Committee's very presence.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award.
The President does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a President who leads a war in two countries at present.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics would forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a degree and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate to charitable works, but has not yet specifically decided which.
His programme will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of nature accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police charged the president of the Association Société des protectors de la nature de Litoměřice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for his withdrawal from his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman of the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and at risk up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting buckets are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their drinks packagings, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting buckets at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before you find the right buckets.
I don't mean that we wouldn't sort everything out in Brno.
But I feel that our city's second largest city councillors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the Stone Age of Sorting Waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but above all because of the number of buckets dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is all science, which requires mainly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't like me, but that seems to me very little.
Not to mention the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city it's not a safe haven either.
So to finish, many of my friends don't sort their waste.
Per paresse.
It makes them a trout to get to the barns.
I'm not surprised about them.
After a party myself, I offered to throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except that I didn't see any colour buckets of Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the wastes overflowed.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is likely that ecology and so-called aestheticism are not of much interest to Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy in the city a place in the first league of hockey that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying a few extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after dragging a moment on the Internet.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole Moravia region in the South.
Parubek's budget has dropped from retirement and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or public servants may be lacking money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It is only to put the problems back later, to mine the land," Janota said.
We need to know that on the money borrowed the interest to be paid is increasing and that it will need to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not lower social aid or expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those currently increasing on the left: firefighters, educators, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their retirement or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater government debt - next year it will not be missing 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will increase more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to repair it and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also be missing five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and started sections that cannot be modified to reduce costs.
At the very least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty large yards, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the caution of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very properly - it will draw in the dividends of ČEZ (electric power supplier and distributor), which the state has most and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damage, to supplement pension accounts or to reserve the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this tip increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has declined by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, Janota notes.
The Minister will then have to save money from the department or, at worst, from the government's budget reserve.
There is also a hundred million missing from the two billion-dollar state fund project, which must allow you to track on-line what each government's expenditure is.
The first step will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed appear promising.
Just one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which deals mainly with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is no part of fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is on the rise.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Desert runways only pose problems to lift-back operators.
Lack of snow dissuades people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users travel through offers, request prices but do not undertake to book for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud in Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl information portal.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams to Špindler.v Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate to book.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation is only then you can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hotels offer only one week's stays for the New Year.
I think they're going to try to place them again, but they're going to give up, too, and they're going to accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The Ingtours tourism agency of Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week is of most interest to us for the moment, it is not completely sold.
It's still free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February go as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, the interest for winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend winter in the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are recovered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for New Year as well as Christmas.
There is great interest during the holiday of January of the Polish and February also sells well," said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at ninety percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent of employment at present.
February is a little lower for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will still grow has certainly indicated the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, hotels in the Krkonoše do not have to expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there are precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, time should warm up, Jiří Jakubský reports from the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is a mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president of the sage reputation, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he himself considered to be very simple.
When he ended up allowing his doctrine to be breathed so heavily awaited, it turned out that he had collected it on carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not happy to use in the text even several times the expression "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is, moreover, to use the title of the January 2007 Bush discourse as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by civil war as being "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which issued recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful so that newspapers currently do not speak at all from Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, which means, objectively speaking, he left his successor a final situation far more favourable than we could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
Again, campaign commanders called for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite the habit of subordination.
He called for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months but without a better option, he cheated the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to remove the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, even if he had 10,000 at the beginning.
What brings the most problems throughout Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. Obama's entire doctrine brings more questions than it provides.
Many doubt the fact that a half increase will bring the same fruit as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is marked by the opposite exact - no one can count on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their leadership daily according to their arrangements.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only dust in the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups in the light of the lack of clarity about relations, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "promote state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy is perplexing by its volunteerism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only become worse and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of the war in view of their "promple return to the house" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, since the Taliban will view it as the indirect testimony of the US defeat.
NATO's last summit has shown that Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is geared towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
For example, it will be necessary to respond when, according to Obama, America is coming to the victorious withdrawal of Afghanistan's troops.
However, each solution of this type will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only routine for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it to plan a new strategy, if it would prove to be a total fiasco.
Bank leaders Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums
High-ranking employees of the US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticisms about its wage practices.
The group of 30 leading leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell before five years.
Actions may be withdrawn from management if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus takes the lead in the effort to link wages with long-term performance at Wall Street.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank became the target of criticism after nearly $17 billion was set aside for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters Agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, strong bank sector premiums have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it was planning to allocate a single tax of 50 percent the bankers' bonuses over 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
There are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in Technical and Literature disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the Romanian writer Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry award was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a winner this year was physics.
This award was given today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the degree, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The well-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward, since it was only at the beginning of his journey and was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is indispensable for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to Chateau
President Václav Klaus will receive the finance minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who will put his stay on the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for the coming year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which further deepens the public finances crisis.
President Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss her function Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the Chamber of Deputies has validated the left-wing proposals on money transfers on Wednesday and has increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government was repudiating the proposals of the democrats for their indirect increase in the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, and disagrees which questions the future of Fischer's firm which had been formed by agreement between the SDG, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by Members, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer government and which he believes must charge the State debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but does not force it, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrefrable deficit" of public finances.
Now there is, in his view, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could rely on a consensus of wider political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is exhausting and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, SDO and Greens clearly no longer works.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dratic verdicts".
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Government of Topolánek is overwhelming and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD has successfully qualified for ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticisms that the main roles played by American actors, South Africans claim that Hollywood Invictus's new film - Invaincu will expose a lot of things to the world about the country, its battles and its victories.
The story is about sport, race relations with Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded for Oscars, frames the film on Nelson Mandela's life, untiringly fighting against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that it was a ninety-nine-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally..
The sixty-two-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby drama in the middle of the box, for example, has embodyed the leader of a movement against slavery himself becoming a slave, a President of the United States fictional, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and as important for so many people as Mandela.
The former South African man was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invincu and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains and is still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is persuaded to be able to unite his people through sport and decides to join rugby players who are among the outsiders at the global level.
The South African team will eventually make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story on large screen.
I had no other goal but to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind bars before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to hold his hand.
I realized that when I held my hand, I recovered your energy, it was transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare himself for a role in the rough middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look a lot bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus under the hood of the director Eastwood received positive opinions and even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
The newspaper Daily Variety's film critic Todd McCarthy summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film evaluations on rottentomates.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway was observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the missile of type "Bulava" which was originally the pride of the Russian army gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got hurt in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "the missile that does not steal"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was usually done at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the aircraft.
It was obviously the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be set on fire from a moving and immersing vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object probably was by a defective "Bulava".
After all, Norwegians have not doubted for a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the avalanche touched only the third.
In previous cases, engines have experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test releases have passed without a record, the Ministry of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent thus fills the generals with optimism and therefore they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear cores of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again take part in a 51-year-old professional match.
The former world champion, the Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will hand in hand to his team of the CSKA Moscow in need and will probably make his entry already during the Friday game against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at forty years in 1998, is for now the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov became the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union, he twice set off gold at the Olympic Games, seven world champion titles, he won the Canada Cup as well as the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member since 2001 of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancelled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that unions reported an emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk of Hyundai factory confirmed it.
However, management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday that is still working this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why additional volunteer hours were proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
Sedmička.cz reported that the company offered a 400-chronic bonus to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
He will also be awarded post-graduate for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way its employees are motivated in exchange for overtime.
They either receive the supplement for overtime hours, or they can place a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their end-of-year holidays indicated Vaněk.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and warmest point in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management decided to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, car workers were forced to work almost daily for two additional hours in more than eight hours.
Trade unions are counting on cancelling the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car plant and the trade unions must take place Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the strike in case of agreement on their claims and signing a common document.
The situation in the plant ended last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously started strike due to unceasing overtime.
They also protested against the bad conditions of wages and alleged shams.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the requirements for car production.
During the Monday strike announcement, trade unions also asked that employees who had ceased production be subject to no penalties.
Trade unions call on society to reduce time spent to a minimum of hours.
In addition, they want this year a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (209 €) for these.
Nošovice's Hyundai car factory currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last year in November.
It produced approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV into the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it also deals with viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality, in some cases, takes the top on the fact that the combination does not deal as intensively with the current variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, the lives of patients can be radically extended through a combination of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of the experts from three institutions, the Czech Republic Academy of Sciences, the Prague VŠCHT and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to coping with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metal-carborates are acting on the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the resistance problem.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links to virus proteins.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon and are connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A betrayed and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a HIV virus protein that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV virus caused by HIV protease, there would be no mature infectious particles in the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, explaining researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Cheque Science and Biochemistry of the Czech Republic Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested as well as its resistant variants obtained from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metal carbide is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarbores, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to explore further to develop effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Łezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Debates of the European Parliament
The President of the ODS (Democrat Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek has qualified as "suffering" the approved budget for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the SSB's remarks as a drastic verdict.
He says take time to analyze.
ODS spokesperson Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative firm supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether the House of Deputies supports the minority who is concerned about combating the growing deficit, or whether it is concerned about remaining in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDG and the social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with the proposed amendments of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The Chamber has increased money for employees' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the proposals of the democrats was that they were indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The SDG left the room before the vote, thus obeying the wish of the government as if a modified budget was a less bad option than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of helplessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office if proposals for amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made a meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday after his transition to government:
He also indicated that he wondered whether he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason why.
If Fischer decides to continue to address the budget deficit, Nečas considers that the representatives of ČSSD, who imposed the budget changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, retirement, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDG are not at issue.
This is the case with the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the SDO did nothing harmful, said Topolánek in a text communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are demanding TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign from the government deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that he is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the Chamber."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda, then I will devote myself to it, said from the Chamber to the journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew into the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has moved backwards at the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas also stressed that the SDG would probably have voted against the modified budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democratic Members to allow the budget to vote.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, did he react to the question of whether the SDO had not been blamed on the part of the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I didn't notice that my vote would have failed.
I already knew when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a curfew of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new ČD schedules, there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
The Czech Railways will delete or limit some less-loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will fall to the date of entry into force of the new two-percent hours compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, the residents of the Ostrava region will have more links to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an expression will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region of eight percent in total, on the other hand, Prague and its surroundings can be welcomed for an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor line - České Budějovice are also cancelled and a few express trains on the Prague - Písek line - České Budějovice will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the major changes, one can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment Milovice's inhabitants must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines away to the capital will have their final destination at the main train station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart within two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13th.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million extra crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Iron Roads next year in a total of four billion crowns to settle visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in nearly three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Iron Roads have again signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Iron Roads appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use a price increase of the vast majority of transport tickets.
Changes will only affect one-day tickets ČD Net and low-price eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the journey, while so far it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroner.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children have been released
The rebels today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP that informed them, but spoke at the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields when fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first pursued the raiders as a result of violence caused in the settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Magundanao in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23rd November massacre linked to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, these have renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the American halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates a part of the life of the former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the combatant against known worldwide apartheid returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, feedback from critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
He was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvesu, South Africa, on the complete name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, then in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the cut-off of the world of football, and also because the media are driven by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination among the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are at the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations made to the main roles where Hollywood stars "paving".
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film by taking his own words back.
I dreamed of this long-standing role and prepared myself well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to be able - as it is said - to recover from his energy, he indicated during the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you can remember yourself through the film the personality and message of Mandela.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns each individual he added.
Bringing the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel of the British writer John Carlin is the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicting the South African defender of human rights during his mandate to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman therefore tried during the film to collect two racial groups of a long-divided population and as well as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he was wearing the national jersey of the South African team on the world cup lawn, which South Africa had won at the time.
Mandela had long been ovated fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by white people.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in reuniting people into a single nation again, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the situation in South Africa is going to improve.
The South African whites are, however, skeptical as recently commissioned in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the region of Louny
A fire swallowed in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov na Lunsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesperson for Ústí firefighters, there are six units operating on fire.
They initially wanted to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the company's spokesperson Pavla Mandátova, the incident did not endanger the safe operation of the transmission package.
The damage is estimated at some tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, Čeps did not know anything like it and that such incidents are isolated.
The electrical power supplies were not interrupted, said the company's spokesperson ČEZ for the Northern Bohème Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in Czech territory of 400 kV transmission and electrical lines and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution posts with 67 transformers transferring electric energy from transport sets to distribution sets and lines paths of 4339 kilometres in length.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today a complaint for defamation against three democratic social prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the region of South Moravia, Radko Martínka of the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura told him in Dvacet minutes of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in some regions.
However, all regions have signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of them attacked us and claimed that we made the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for the slanders on Student Agency, said Jančura at Radiožurnál.
He also pointed out that there was evidence that no region had agreed with European law.
This is why we are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's complaint is a continuation of his media show that serves him as free advertising for his company and for his person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertising that will mention the unfavorable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and that he intended to resume it after New Year's.
He stated that the campaign will focus on corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion kroner, without issuing an invitation to tender.
According to Jančura, such an action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought threats to Jančura by a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name, Jančura said today to Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcals will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcals will reverse the old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voting is already taking place, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Experts are also clear in the vaccination process.
New vaccination.
Free vaccines for August children.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year, one quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcals.
However, parents paid 1600 crowns or more for one dose.
The vaccination of younger children requires four doses.
Experts believe that each year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 kroner at doses of vaccine.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
To date, the State has spent about 500,000 krona per year on all vaccinations for children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age from pneumococcal infections occurred.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcals.
At an international conference at which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied that we had an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we could impose at least this.
I think this is a direction to follow now said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococcals.
We are not looking at him for the moment, said his spokesman, Mr. Vlastimil Sršeň.
Vaccination optionally has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Société specialité des paediatres, recognizes that voluntary vaccination is based on his defects.
If all children were vaccinated, a decrease in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional" said Cabrnochová.
The specialists expect that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their babies.
Vaccination against pneumococcals is also marked by the fact that the first vaccination of children is funded by insurance rather than by the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release prevention funds, thus saving on future medical care.
Physicians will have to buy their own products
However, this is related to the concerns of paediatric practitioners regarding the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to purchase vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as other State-provided vaccine products.
Some Members feared, however, that this would allow insurance to "deduct health insurance amounts".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to repay them.
It is estimated that paediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 krona per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It'll be a long way from being easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Flight of Museum"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings for a value of $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been questioned while he was loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical leather to force the museum entrance in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Press Agency Associated Press (AP).
AP cited a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Frazetta Jr claimed to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the tables to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior refused to give such permission, the agency said.
Labour defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the increase in tax and reduction of expenditure announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticisms of opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by reporting his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also drew attention to low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a ceiling of 1% on public salaries starting in 2011.
The wrath of Social Insurance
Trade unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession that they are not responsible for and warned that "problems" were announced.
The reduction in social insurance - which will allow about GBP 3 billion per year - has made the world of businesses angry, because he believes it is a job tax while the goal should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers bonus
The increase in corporate profits tax for small companies has been abandoned
Reduced taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Retirement increase of 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person who earns GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a person who earns GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, whereas a person who earns GBP 10,000 per year will win GBP 110 more.
Ministers stated that their goal to reduce the deficit by half before 2013 was "hard decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would weigh on the first 5 per cent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, rejected an increase in tax and stressed that a decrease in expenditures was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and the growth of the economy would start again at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP above the estimate.
"Half Opportunity"
The Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning against the "debt crisis" of Labour, stated that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, elucidating "scientificly" difficult choices until after the elections - which must be held in June 2010.
"They presented nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour stressed that schools, hospitals and the police would be protected from future reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would result in a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But Lib Dems claimed that the money collected through the increase in taxes and the decrease in expenditure would be used to support next year's spending rather than to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were "constructed on the wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC's Political Editor, said that the advertising schedule - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April next year, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, with money being simply recovered the following year.
However, the Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish details of spending beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that restrictions on public spending would start to feel only in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Études Fiscales) stated that the Chancellor's figures would entail substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only delayed," said his Director Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report.
The FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested at a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab , announced the American Embassy in Pakistan at BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether the same men had been reported missing from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sought information about these people.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani descent, one Egyptian heritage and the other Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesperson, said the agency had heard about the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether they really are the students who have gone missing," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncles.
She said that the house was already monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
State Secretary Hillary Clinton refused any comments on arrests, reported press agency Reuters, but stated that the United States had to "collaborate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been carried away from their homes by their families, in Northern Virginia, at the end of November.
Amnesty Condemns Iranian Abuse
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the report of the Amnesty International Association.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities stated that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens have been killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's contested election has led to major public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Twelve have been sentenced to prison sentences and the prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
Since then, however, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, said our correspondent.
"Fausse confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against election results.
"They often hit my face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half-conscious," Amnesty said.
In August, the candidate losing the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that demonstrators held after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
While the Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, they admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the park of the city
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform Bristol's site into a competitive track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 skiers and semi-professional snowboarders competing for cash prices.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park, a small tramp preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the top view of the track was beautiful but that it was rather intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining in contrabas.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prizes have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for some fifteen years and the effects of which are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's latest book presents a much wider and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim Spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very well aware of listening to and reproducing the discussions between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the mayorate (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to get a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not debate until the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen generally agree with their lawyers of a Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia which today constitute a small part of the Muslims of Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularity of French people could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the so virulent intellectual elite of secularism) were actually committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not harmed, in relation to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing navigate into new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
He knew about the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting white bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave 14-year-old aspiring to fight only the tip of his mosquito, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent into zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show assembled 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually one millionth of the area needed for an adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the algae that were growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose on species survival.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorcycle Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations of the hunt that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alumn Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating overview of what the future may be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
There's no need to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th, the pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the source of the ice cap.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the relief changes under it.
Satellite surveillance and probes on icebergs are of great help, but the largest of the work is made by durciful men, camping in the cold.
Anderson beholds the extraordinary and tiny world of the arctic ice-dependent system, formed by the saltwater nets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it may be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the tombs in Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus trip to deposit a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, to North Carolina at the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday mornings to deposit crowns on Veterans' tombs, in different sections of Arlington Ceremony's cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also established a non-profit association, "Wreaths Across America", which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has provided more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this was a way to thank those who sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Employed in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as from the Vietnam War, because they are not often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples stood by their hands, wearing the fresh pine crowns on the gray tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Nearly he planned the silence on Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhumed.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others were looking to see the small black and white information cards, stuck in the wet soil for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She was from Zanesfield in Ohio and had taken eight hours to come and gather on the tomb of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free for... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, and affirmed the services of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on client projects such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to have access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez made a number of requests to leave the country to receive awards, but authorizations have always been refused.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the Communist Government of the Brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance through concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or an employee's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press member of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a major mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be permitted -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace Fidel, his sick elder brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often caused a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries began to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities found a supposed organization preparing a plot to send five North Virginia men to Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this would allow an important network of terrorist recruiters who were looking for radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Having arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistani secret services who was informed about the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince Al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the banned mountains of the north-east became a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered to be infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed himself on condition of keeping the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into the camps of al-Qaida when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are questioned by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in determining those in whom they trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, U.S. secret services have given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruits play the role of gatekeepers, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their advertising value.
However, Evan Kohmann, an expert from the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups also need to pay more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept because US secret services have become experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model than so many others have? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen ask for "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked in the streets, here on Saturday, calling for more action on the climate of the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center congresses of the city.
The number of protesters was estimated to be 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings, downtown.
On this day when little has happened during the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists have walked through the city, deploying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, saying 'The Earth says it has enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to his mother's home country, Peru, opened his eyes to the tearing problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change that is already taking place."
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to make the word pass and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep anonymous due to its involvement in climate discussions, activists who wore masks and black clothes lit several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters failed to raise the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative for climate.
When asked whether he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, that is something I did not know about.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful from perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb negotiations or harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal tenacious differences between races
Last week's federal report on results in mathematics brought good news for public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the District is still far behind leading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more advanced in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the recent figures of the National Assessment of Education Progress are the continuing gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 white children (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only from one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view over a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Director of Educational Institutions Group Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in District education.
I do not miss the joy of one or two won points, said Kwame R. Brown (Democrat-parent), Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Basic School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the message of the test results is that the city's middle schools (schools) desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (schools).
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students at the end of the elementary cycle classes and at the beginning of college who have not integrated the reading bases earlier in their school course and are rather late in relation to their peers.
Every day, the math program, for the Kindergarten (Maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who also has to be credited for the NAEP progress reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to those students at a lower level than that of the class," Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for less successful schools in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at Berkeley University in California who is studying the results of city tests.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighbourhoods of Washington.
This targeting may also have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they are from, can be assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap in success was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the Washington District, to be in competition with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "start point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descending and blinking at a moment of sight with white columns, brick façades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 students (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of a new student who was impressed than enthusiastic.
That's where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide led them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? says she's thinking, when she was given the low law teacher ratio - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit the children during their three-day discovery trip and now they have fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely raised for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who have left high school where they have become parents in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands of children who benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic of the "second generation" in five-year high school studies -- a remarkable success if one considers that both of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they open the way for future generations to play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study the beaters claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an inherent need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university -- in particular, if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We must consider providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared you) , it provides over $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when students of low-income families are middle school (school) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, which has been invalidated by dozens of years of war and sanctions.
American companies have left with participation in only two of the 10 auction fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only one who had an auction lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies opened the way, Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, said an Internet site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability while U.S. military forces retreated, hindered American oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, the analysts say.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and West Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who had strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided them with technical advice, left their hands empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the State, has more contracts than other companies and has divided with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected auction companies made bids that were then compared to the barrel tariff that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the leading organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, having hit the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, reported Friday by the U.S. counter-expansion authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their cars on Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
The local authorities claimed that the missiles were fired by a non-pilot aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchist tribal border of Pakistan.
They drove a white car, headed to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani Civil Secret Services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority said that suspicious local militants rushed on the spot and quickly confiscated what remained of "completely torn-off bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American anti-terrorism representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was one of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of al-Qaida military organizers leading the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic guidelines of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said that Somalia had made rapid progress in the al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known by the American general public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second major character of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of the CIA drone attacks has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also impatiencefully killing suspected informants, says the site.
The United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdrew
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he was going to resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate of allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide intervenes while the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States calendar for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO Governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military Powers to increase the number of international civil servants assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign but would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement," Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is an Italo-Switzerland citizen who recently chaired a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September of encouraging President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism in relation to international election observation."
Eide stated that it had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged United Nations leaders to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than he was assigned to the mission to Afghanistan, saying that this would give them greater confidence in how their money was spent.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy UN employment regulations were hampering its ability to bring new talents.
The United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary for Defence, Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world's great powers were soon to impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of an outpost of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a one-week visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a renewal.
One of the things that weighs me most is that if I've learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it's the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He stated that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer enormously from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesperson of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not return its nuclear programme in full conformity with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has led to such an agreement, a way of building confidence on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has been away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's consolidation of some of the international community's proposals for which they had indeed given their agreement at the beginning of October led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not considered, in response to significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set the deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to the proposals before turning to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations stated what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue its talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nuri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich Kurdish oil region to meet with the Army leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays in American plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the pending withdrawal. American authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Regional Government of Kurdistan: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up with a propagandizing poster, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An additional baby, it is an additional grave".
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the ageing of the population, radically changed their direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have a second left," said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good play and spoiled, known as the "small emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
Population distribution, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and older will explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in coastal wealthy cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission said that fertile couples had to have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "so old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is to date, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist Government.
Couples who transgress this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual incomes -- and suffer discrimination at the workplace.
The Chinese authorities attributed to the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced the abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women of a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys - girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened a lot of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters that encourage families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has sent family planners and volunteers to meet couples at home, and to slip prospectus under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wish to have more than one child.
According to the family planner, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although leaders in a rural town in Shanghai say that they have seen an increase in couples' applications for a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The town of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials claim that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of Family Planning Committee in Shanghai City of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they only have minimum health insurance and government life insurance.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly consider that the single child's policy is a problem of rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
True, we steal the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and had the habit of everybody taking care of us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it more accurately.
For couples working in two, middle class, who lower the birth rate, it says, it must be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don't want to have themselves this lifestyle, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from her parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you have to write his resume to get a place in the best nursery."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations -- has returned under the fire of the Friday ramp, due to the publication of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden, in the coming years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases has highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it has clarified the path to be taken.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in timeless negotiations, with over 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support climate warming in the longer and longer term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process," said John Coequyt, Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described as the "full picture" of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer.
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries during the same period would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday by promising to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support flooding and drought or to avoid deforestation.
On Friday, however, the same verbal conflicts have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder on China than the Bush administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without effort and action from the major developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the US main negotiator, either lack of "good sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help financially China to fight climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have appeared both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing about their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major issuers responsible for their actions.
This is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, Ulate said, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put pressure on obtaining a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a proposal for a 24-page treaty, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of Climate Unity of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the complete political process", in part by what they are now unified and that they call on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debate became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in place before the heads of governments reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Indian Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister came down from their aircraft and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Congress Palace every day -- guitar players present night shows mocking countries that they believe betray themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
Intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 Heads of Government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the grand court," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the World Conservation International Policy.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 p.m., Monday morning, a blow of whistle will go through the night to report the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will row from Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and would link the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The small lost holes will become flourishing suburban cities, the lengths of business trips will be much shorter, and the passage of aircraft and car by train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable planning battle, and the fear of environmental hazards are likely to stop British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will make its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a higher-speed network, heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Penguins to Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A unique line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial trace is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the network at high speed.
Rail industry experts report that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks that the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken prior to a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping travel between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This seems to be the best solution to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for rail revolution.
The taxpayers reimburse the loan of GBP 75,000 for the Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the chief member of Parliament Tory, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orangery he built in his home of his constituency.
The party leader who was endorsed by David Cameron to complain that the members of parliament were "maintained", increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build an extension of oak to his second house in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay additional interest, amounting to hundreds of books per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not interrogated by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a monitoring of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of the parliament, is the owner of a two-storey house in a village in his district of Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly one million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office claims that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda at home, describing it in his plans as an orange tree.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Privileges and Standards of the Commons concerning his pre- borrowing arrangements.
The Committee found him guilty last month of any charge of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of the loan of GBP 271,406 from his London property to his constituency that he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The standard interest rate variable RBS increased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Phantom Cabinet Officer in September, after a covert journalist reportedly filmed him saying that the members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expenditure scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated like "m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, millionaire since his former position as a oil trader, began to have to explain his expenditures, in May, after he appeared to have requested thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the office of fees that this could "be considered excessive".
One activist dug a pound hole in the lawn of M Duncan, to protest after it was revealed that he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fee office and by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of fraud or development or use of the rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be clearer or simpler."
Faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent calendar.
Brighton beach cabins have found a new means of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages the spiritual exploration by creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for every December day, using the theme of Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 18:30, every day, with free pastries and hot wine served.
The songs of Christmas chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-remunerated priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Avent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police conducted several hundred inquiries.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, walked in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, to arrive by Friday at an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making "the political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the start of the courthouse, when a group of 300 protesters, fully black-dressed, broke windows with paving and hammers, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-semitting police officers intervened immediately without any housekeeping.
In total, the police announced the inquiry of 600 to 700 people, essentially according to the members of "Black Blocks", these ultraviolent clusters that had been illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were called "without distinction", pointing out that about one hundred of them "were always held on the street on Saturday evening" and held in a seated position despite extreme cold".
Party of Parliament, the court, rather good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without looking to enter it.
A scene had been set to accommodate the speakers planned, before a candle watch with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by car and running the big cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue sky waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for climate".
Today, we go down to the streets to claim compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the Beninese singer Angélica Kidjo.
There are rivers that are drying up in Africa, streams where we can walk like we've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992, with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alter-globalist movement drew close to environmental organizations.
The French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of the altermondialism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, walked in red, planting bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, gatherings of a few hundred protesters have also been held to call for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Abkhazia separatist elected his president, Georgia denounces a "face"
The Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "face".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to the Abkhaze Electoral Commission.
The first interim results were to be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in high school, including the outgoing president Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "rules that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 people, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling office in a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region to sumptuous landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, gave warm welcome to Russian officials who had come to monitor the elections.
We, the Abkhaze people, are grateful, said at a small ceremony, in reference to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises agreements with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims neither to support the current power nor the opposition.
A 50% majority plus a vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people walked around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the one who lives, called for nearly 700 people in the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement that will have to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Party of Parliament, the general good child court, took the lead of the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center, without looking to enter it.
A scene had been set to accommodate the speakers planned, before a candle watch with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the court, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke out windows, found an AFP journalist.
They were immediately surrounded by rioting police officers and intervened without any housekeeping, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the inquiry of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of "Black Blocks", these ultraviolent clusters that had been illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the interrogation of about 20 people, according to the police.
We had eyes on extremist clusters, warned police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while law enforcement helicopters turned to heaven.
The majority of the protesters, who came in and out of the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue sky waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for climate".
Today, we go down to the streets to claim compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992, with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alter-globalist movement drew close to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, figure of the alter-globalism, told the PSA to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The organization Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, have demonstrated, dressed in red and floating bands boasting solar energy in front of the mayorate of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, gatherings of a few hundred protesters have also been held to call for action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).

The history-geo comes reinforced from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "enhanced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminals.
Now, the first students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Mr.Chatel.
For the minister, "you have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "S is no longer a scientific course" but "in large, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain sub-files of the S, he goes on, stressing again: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals inundate themselves from the absence of history-geography in terminal in technological high schools."
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in Humanity revealed that almost seven French out of ten (69%) disagreed with the government's plan to suppress compulsory history-geography education in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and some right-wing elected.
On the other hand, the minister added that it was "no question" to remove the philosophy of terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their view sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will undergo at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will address their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also follow internships during the year of M2 and will be a first year before students as trainee teachers.
If you add all the internships proposed before the competition, you already get more presence before the students, or more than 300 hours, it continued.
Finally, the Minister states that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in National Education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Superior Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a 15-minute engagement of experts, each filmed and opened to the public, observed a AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that caught people and gave them the desire to know more, explained on the margins of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day who took his name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Some 20 stakeholders are selected from their discipline experts and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
About climate warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but with graphics, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will consider that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
The videos taken from these conferences will be posted online on the school site from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled in February, followed by others at a two-monthly rate.
Delays in payments: anger of prison supervisors, planned actions
The prison supervisors' unions called on Friday for "general mobility" to require the payment by year-end holidays of additional premiums and hours of which payment was rejected in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd Union of Supervisors) has asked staff who will not be on duty to manifest Tuesday morning in front of prisons and "block" them to "denominate the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "gather in general assemblies in the various prisons for strong mobilization", judging "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first Union of Supervisors, the Autonomous Federal Union of Prisons (Ufap/Unsa), "calls it for general mobilization (...) to bring about an increase in discontent and anger".
The Prison Administration Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts of staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the head of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of hours in the future did not occur, said Alliot-Marie.
The December payment will therefore be minor, except for management staff benefiting from the famous functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have good backs".
This is a scandal, the interregional union of the FO of Marseilles was indignant, announcing its decision to boycott to the new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those in October are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable that we should take care of personnel's money, says Bordeaux's CGT-penitentiary.
According to unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less crowded than others.
But in any case the account is not there, noted the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "sweetest tips" than those he receives
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas as a family at the White House, entrusted to the "paper" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things more delicious than those I receive."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on Sunday night on the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate the holidays of the year in their new and prestigious stay.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be on the side.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "certainly" a gift, according to excerpts from the broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama took the false stand against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she tricked the president.
At all, was he obliged to grant before responding with humor by showing the First Lady's pearl collar from the finger: "Who gave you this?".
During this one-hour show, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a strong support from Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father he rarely saw offered to him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It was only later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to important "leions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "harm resulting from the operation" of the discal hernia suffered in Paris on 26 November, he told Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "necessary repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, sought to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued within 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the last singer's tour, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
Only in 48 hours will we have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by the PSA, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic for this discal hernia.
The intervention, programmed for several days had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This one was not available Thursday evening to comment on RTL information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for a follow-up response infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, estimated on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself not to make himself "no concern" for the rocker, who is "a beater".
He had just called me before I left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because it was 12 hours of aircraft after such an operation, it's not playable, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, stating that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily with antibiotics" and that the infection was "independed".
Mr. Camus also said that he had had met with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, at the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated with a "small colon cancer", then with a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been quite commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulty of moving on stage.
In mid-November, his surroundings had even to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first Bousquet on its fetish distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the Worlds-2009 in a large basin, released on Thursday an international title on a distance that he particularly affects, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro-2009 in a small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three records of the world beaten while waiting for a deferral.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relay gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, which highlighted the world record of 50 m free, of which he holds the brand in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queens of swimming, the 50 m free, it was the 28-year-old French who imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers started against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet preceded Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in the event, I said that if the record of the world was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were covered with polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from January 1.
Originally from 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epics in Istanbul, which had hosted the first ones in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations did not serve this time in German Paul Biedermann, a double champion of the world in large basin this summer in Rome, records from the world to the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he owns over 400 m free swim (3:32.77) but imposed itself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I haven't given up on this race.
I knew this time I couldn't beat a record of the world but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola awarded 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was charged on Thursday, $1.5 million, clearly above its estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This panel before two meters long over 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
He was sold in one hundred batches.
The sale is still in progress but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have most up to now, told the PSA a spokesperson of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained close to 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made an element of his bath in his particular Parisian hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council prior to the accession to the power of the Marshal Pétain.
There was a shadow zone of about 50 years.
By searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure attempt from Honduras Zelaya to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who had been denied an exception by the Putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government aircraft departed to his place of origin, according to a source of the Migration Branch.
The Putschist government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a safe haven.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the guest chief of state.
The Putschist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to give up my charge (...), they wanted me to resign," said Mr. Zelaya on Thursday on Globo radio, on which he has often expressed himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the fallen president, refugee to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted us a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, said Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, on HRN Honduran Radio.
I do not ask for asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to be made as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Mr Zelaya's initial rumours had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the fallen president, who had come to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military had strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government in relation to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, on the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He had returned to Costa Rica in surprise on September 21 and had taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested to respond to the "high treason" crime of which he is charged with justice, according to the Putschist government.
President Putschiste Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street climbs, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with US trade balance figures showing the resumption of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq, with technological dominance, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index accounted for 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegza said of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, it has temperate, estimating that the market was focused on "half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures in the U.S. trade balance, "showing that the activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit declined by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting the opposite of a divestment of the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the leading US trading partners, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment enrolments in the United States have increased against all expectations last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest in one year," said Scott Marcouiller, by Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday evening and that of the 30-year-old to 4.492% on 4.408% on the day before.
Cuba: hundreds of supporters of power consist of the "White Ladies"
A few hundred supporters of Cuba's power constituted wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on Thursday for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were called.
Some forty "White Ladies", married or close to political prisoners, were conceived on the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched towards the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, noted a AFP journalist.
At the bottom of the Yankees!, "mercenaires!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" were scanning, the uplifted fist, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who "ensure their protection".
The previous day, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to manifest themselves on Thursday for the international human rights day were, they, called by civilian police, found an AFP journalist.
The police force in civilian vehicles led the dissidents who were constituted by government supporters, according to this journalist.
In general, discontinuing in similar circumstances takes only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Women in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under lockdown.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "mercenaries" or "actors" at the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely enough, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "contro-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of misrepresenting rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced killer kills an octogener in the knife and gets 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed with two knives killed an octogener and injured five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influx, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the attacker, aged 28, would have struck with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogeneary, in or before a pharmacy of the 85 Boulevard Jean-Jourès, learned from police sources and from witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929 by a senior officer of the Alliance Police Union, died in the hospital after his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he then took a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, aged about 30 years, interfered and was injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogeneary succumbed.
The days of the other injured are in danger, while vital organs are apparently affected, depending on police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and would have been hospitalized "in shock condition", according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled into the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have hurt two passersby, apparently at random: a 30-year-old and a quadrant, this last grieving.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore in the cross behind his back, explained on site a union officer Alliance in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, according to testimony collected by the PSA, tried to control the forcible.
I saw a guy about 30 years old with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was expensive, told Alberto, server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Always Boulevard Jean-Jourès, at the height of No.61, two municipal police officers, whose leaders, tried to intercept the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers came to tell me there was someone injured outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, put him in a security position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of about 30 years of age, wounded with a knife.
They are national police personnel who have arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has before it the investigation the Departmental Judicial Police Service of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The forcible was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard as part of his guard.
A police source did not exclude him from being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all forced of this species whose forces decoupled under the effect of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the cessation of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), the abandonment of the prosecution against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the director's lawyer of the "Pianist", denounced three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California with serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I demand the abandonment of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the trial judge at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has died since -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural failure.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his case.
The prosecution reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no discharge of charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Deputy Attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be here to attend the hearing."
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to flee? asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks favor to the court, while disregarding her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that there were other alternatives to flight.
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to call for the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called for, once again, an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure has been fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to reside in his Gstaad chalet, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, restrained by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended up undirected on Friday, in a market between better indicators than expected in the United States and the increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while Nasdaq, a technologically dominant one, abandoned 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, noted Mace Blicksilver, by Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchanges has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "contributed to improving market opinion on the robustness of economic recovery", summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of affiliate and much more than planned.
In addition, the confidence of US consumers was significantly increased in December to 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been hampered by a further increase in the dollar, at the latest two months before the euro, which "put down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, from Deutsche Bank.
Technology values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury Bond increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% Wednesday evening and that of the 30-year-old to 4.497% compared to 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss Monde's election again in South Africa
After a month of journey through South Africa, the 112 candidates under Miss Monde are preparing to cross the last line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them already picked up their ticket for the half-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Sports Miss or Miss top model during their African stay.
That was a real peacock.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I have seen so many things and have lived so many experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone calls herself.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast on Saturday live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17H00 (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to restore my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova points out in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian girl, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "the landscapes to cut the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood stars.
It's the dream of every woman being crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, Miss India launches with a big smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
Candidates will show up in traditional costumes and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by a TV host, Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a member of the Miss Monde Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it was able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, president of Miss Monde.
The candidates have as they did last year a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time on bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with the South African President Jacob Zuma who held their hand.
Not common to a chief of state, Miss Sierra Leone notes.
Their best memories will probably remain the draw in the Cape (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been around people I never thought I could get close.
I'm definitely going back to World 2010, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport where he had to go to his father's hair hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it is very well done, told the press David Hallyday at his departure from the plane that took him from Paris shortly after 13H00 locals (21H00 GMT).
The son of the singer, the relaxed air, assured him that he was going to go "very fast" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a consequent infection to the operation of a discal hernia on November 26, Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for a consequent infection to the operation of a discal hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated on Wednesday night to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning to attend a school show by her daughter Jade, a photographer of the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the Pitie-Salpétriere hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were away, said Mr. Camus.
I've heard about a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus found that Johnny Hallyday was "part too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and that surprised me, since I had two discal hernies myself, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "part without drain, without anything," after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the arts.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphide reputation, convicted on several occasions by justice, in medical liability files, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scrupulously" pursued "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "beyond being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well done" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a dragon," he added.
In any event, the singer's tour, whose health problems have increased since this summer, appears to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a tour resumed on 8 January (at Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, Mr Camus said.
The UDF association increases the tone and sum of the New Centre to no longer use its logo
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem de François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the embodiment of the former Giscardian party, not using it on any support, subject to judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF logo, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of Member Hervé de Charette (formerly NC UMP) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for first filing it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the UDF association's office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to let themselves be possessed, came out of silence to launch a remand to the Minister and the MP, no longer using the logo and conveying the ownership of the mark to them, subject to judicial prosecution.
Over the past few days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to take over the UDF logo, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it would be good to have your militant material tracked and on your site's custody page, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, the slogan +the UDF of today+, also found the subscribers of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this symbol, explains the UDF office that emphasizes the NC to "immediately withdraw the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as of (his) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (la) mark to his legitimate owners."
If you did not, the courts would be sued to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, preventing signatories.
In their mail, they state that the UDF "is a whole political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF congress in 2007 voted for membership of MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continued, "when he filed the mark", he was not "more UDF's adherent for three years", but to the UMP.
It makes scandalous and fraudulent use of the absence of deposit of the UDF acronym to perform it on its own.
This indelicacy is becoming a crime, they denounce, before ironing on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than trying to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as accused by the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian for the spoil of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his pictures of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment and 375,000 euros of fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter broke up while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise from Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collectively by three doctors.
The principal heir and shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The designated doctors will have to submit a report by 10 March 2010 in particular if Liliane Bettencourt is in a weak state and at what periods.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to talk to him about it, he said at the end of the hearing Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...) Expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been charged with criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and an all-inclusive artist, who accuses her of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, counsel's pleadings sometimes turned to the great family divide on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she cared about Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel, "can you explain to my daughter that I wrote in Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I haven't been able to talk to him since his wedding."
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has again held that the complainant was not eligible to act, especially since a guardianship judge has refused to grant his application for a judicial protection procedure for his mother in recent days.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the public ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees has reminded the position of companies facing consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to make employees join "values" determined from above as it once was, to impose products designed by factory technicians to consumers.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquest of markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preference factors comes back regularly!
Demobilization of employees can result in deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a prospective vision"; it requires employees to make a commitment that authoritarian management revenues are totally contrary to.
That is why we call for a management revolution that would be to place employees at the centre of the company's concerns as the client.
Any relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – will they encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First because I could see that, in the face of a new situation, all structures finally arrive, after many detours, to do priority... what she has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory of life, recently reactivated by the "uniary neurosciences" and widely disseminated, to their unawareness, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leviers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent survey of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a position of mechanical governance, inadequate to the world today.
Identifying and measuring mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires adopting a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of achieving some of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
Currently, only the studies of the motivational analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
These studies have demonstrated that they judge their business based on a predetermined doxa that enables them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and restore their management of human resources "to the place".
They thus create an area conducive to the concerted development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo's Speech: The "Just War" Worth Right Praises to Obama · Global Voices
The U.S. right greeted Friday's speech in Oslo last night by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against U.S. enemies.
The Conservatives, who had brokered the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidency candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the right wing of the Republican party, in the U.S. Today newspaper, adding herself to the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that have just been published.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over there, did she think?
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was very good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On the other hand, I found this speech all-out historical, said Mr.Gingrich, interviewed during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a potential candidate for Republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen "a president on the left" remind the members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free and could not return a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former pen converts to Washington Post, Obama pronounced "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizens of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Mr.Gerson.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a falcon of the Bush era, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "terne, ampoule and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the President, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When war is involved in the notion of justice, the massacre of innocents can easily be justified, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained commendable at the President's place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was attributed prematurely to Mr. Obama, qualified his address as "superproduction" even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the daily Californian fires.
Obama "expounded the speech he needed," said the New York Times, judging him "both dark and edifying."
Routes: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three negotiating-marathon sessions, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to be left to the end, reached an agreement Friday evening that ends the strike order and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" of this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left on Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement at the end of the morning.
And the same if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had shut the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting started at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the holidays of the end of years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
At hourly rates, for low wages, "we move from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It's not a big deal, but we're leaving very far, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Either we're going to order our militants that there are no blockades, no blockages of power stations.
But we can still have a few recalcitrators that aren't happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, praised "a good agreement", even though it was "difficult to grant increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will amount to EUR 170 per month for low wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the re-evaluation of the travel costs of 3%, and the general condition of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address, inter alia, the question of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of €100 million in employers' charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 Draft Amending Finance Act, which was voted on Thursday to Friday night by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in identical terms".
TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply first to companies that are members of the organization, and secondly, to the whole profession, in the event of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will take place "in the shortest possible time", Mr. Bussereau assured.
Opposition from employers can only delay the process.
The FNTR has denounced a "dual market", as the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to contradict the turkey eaters of the next awakening, unostra lamented.
For the other, the agreement is likely to "cruise the grave of a large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, disgruntled trade unions of RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, France's largest urban common transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting between trade unions and RATP leadership on Friday to the 2nd day of strike left them on their hunger for their premium application.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10h00 and 20h00, due to one train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train in four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which wait 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP is making efforts to serve large stores".
The RER Across the West is the Parisian agglomeration.
The short RATP section of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train in two circulated at peak hours, and almost no branch in hollow hours, as planned.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Francilians were organized.
Thus, in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, particularly due to the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive at the hour".
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, said the SNCF, which had provided for a management of law enforcement officers and forces.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare station to join the subways.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "weak" by the unions, of a meeting with management Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its parentheses premium proposals, the CGT pointed out, stressing that management "was not fixed to solve a problem while road and SNCF is done".
A new meeting is planned on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," said RATP.
Which also made the unions say that the company "was mocking weekend users".
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee in Paris.
It was then that the management, which so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in the interest of calming down" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand at RR B on Tuesday, after a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions demand a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the daily million of travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their careers, reach 2,200 to 2,700 gross euros and 600 to 650 euros of premiums for shifty hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurde party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court delivered on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurde party, a decision which was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the government's task, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "crazy of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the President of the Hasim Kiliz Court declared to the press, after four days of deliberation.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a seven-voting majority was required to declare the dissolution, said Mr. Kilicç, adding that 37 party executives, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity from Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal window of the rebels of the PKK.
However, the party ensures that it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court then intervenes when the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, attempting to cut the Kurds' support for the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had argued that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the South-East Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as the announcement of justice was announced, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeast town populated by most Kurdes.
Order forces fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with leaves.
A hundred people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of the Justice was "to deepen hopelessness".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurde, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by an Islamic movement party, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, one can expect a response from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
First snows can fall
What Wolfgang Braenburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sanding service (ESF) points out that it is not to be harassed by citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn how to master them.
And according to meteorologists, this could well be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle snow and ice.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Braenburger explained that as soon as he started snowing on Frankfurt City and that the temperatures were falling below zero, large sanding vehicles were traveling 20 main routes (called itineraries A).
This includes high traffic streets, main arteries, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and the slopes such as Atzelbergstraße are also included.
FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a well-adhered road founder within 3 hours of maximum time.
This is why the FES service starts at 3:00 a.m. "to get the roads clear when the daily migration traffic starts."
That's where it gets harder, it's when the snow gets down at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, we are told by the head of the road clearing and sanding service "because no car driver is willing to pass the salage vehicles."
Then, if it doesn't snow anymore, we take care of access roads and dessert roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and lateral streets come last.
Mr Braenburger is aware that this still causes a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot team set off to prioritize areas deemed dangerous and transit.
As for bicycle tracks, EDF services are generally not able to deal with them.
Mr. Braenburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22 hours and 4h30.
As the verglas form very quickly on these surfaces, the salage vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service in cases of need.
The Dinosaurs Berceau
The Tawa found it similar to other carnivorous dinosaurs: this beak was about 2 meters long for 1.50m high, its posterior limbs were powerful, its long skull was filled with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with claws and he had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt from Texas University in Austin and his colleagues in the Science magazine of Thursday, Tawa foundlae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, the Pangea and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa illuminates the evolution of the first dinosaurs on a new day.
Indeed, it provides us with information on the relationship, distribution and characteristics of the relationship.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt began searches with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch website in northern Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Natural History Museum and member of the search team says that they sometimes found a dozen bears in one day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bears belonged to a new species.
The searches updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers baptized him by the name of Tawa according to the word of the Indian Hopi for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a completely exceptional discovery: the dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bone.
All paleontology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, however, he says that it allows to confirm certain theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
The experts ask, among other things, when the saurians were divided into three major evolution groups: the theopods (carnivores) that include the tyrannosaure and the cyclocytor that appeared later on and which descended the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds along the neck, and those who are related to them and the ornithischial herbivores of which species such as triceratops and stegosaure are part.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theories.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found evidence that the Tawa found small airbags in its bones at the skull level, as well as the birds that are the descendants of the theorems.
These small air pockets facilitate bird breathing compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa foundae, vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest terrorists with small airbags in its bones.
As the related line of huge sauropods also had airbags and light bone, it is thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, researchers concluded that the sauriens appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the lands emerging from the Pangea supercontinent.
This appears to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists has also discovered the remains of two other them that are not particularly related to them.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, advancing researchers.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of the Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn says that there is an even older species, the silesaur, who lived in current Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give him a wrong view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved when virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how did the dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era while they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, still today a mystery.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the present crocodiles and many other sauriens.
Toward the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between Trias and Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There was a massive extinction at which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or at that time, dinosaurs were better suited and they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favoring the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which had been living in the shadows since then: they were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors at the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
There are those responsible for courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
Evacuation by the casino police at J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with protest students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, the police requested by the university's governing committee fail to intervene.
Last week, the President of the Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in strike after walls and works of art had been scratched with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories felt that the degradations did not justify "such violent intervention by the police commander against students and teachers who had organized their own courses."
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention solely on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegate and criminalize protest" and tries to make the reasons for mobilization forgotten.
The University's Steering Committee has thus excluded itself from the debates that would be essential.
Course officers require that criminal prosecutions be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the degradation.
Lawitimation of protests
Young people in the Verdi Service Sector Trade Union and the German Confederation of Unions (DGB) are supportive of students.
The protests are merely the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary of the youth of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action and caused the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the Aktuelle Stunde television show.
We understand the meaning of protests but do not accept vandalism, said the CDU Member of the Peter Beuth Regional Parliament.
Parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students' arguments and demands, they are evacuated.
The La Lefte Party filed a motion summarizing the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for police intervention.
The New Silicon-valley
For a long time she had been known as a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under Soviet rule, a place to search for secret weaponry, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the commune has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
There are important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics.
As of September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, a place of French science – with academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday, representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the fully expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the major companies of Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which research centres are established.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scope of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg into a hopeless chaos of construction for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 80s.
The main railway stations, with tracks ending in the middle of town, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that made the brake shoe of the modern rail traffic because it took a lot of time to get the locomotives from the back forward.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what to do.
That is why the line-head stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have not been compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the line-head stations no longer really pose problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with highways and pilot car at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now launched next to the new path of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have taken it.
The railway company is the part because it is the taxpayer who costs the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people - and it is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At that time there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening traffic in goods because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, €6 billion will be included in the Souabe project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport lists sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the 180-kilometre Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 this line has been built at slow pace.
It would be very urgent to put an in-depth support here on the fungus.
But the S21 project does the effect of a brake shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international trade, which is in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews the judgment of the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility to appeal the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Tribunal on the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to review from a legal point of view the judgement rendered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction project of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would take place.
The authorization to land for 17 planes between 23 and 5 hours in the morning, as the Government of the Land has envisaged, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air nuisances.
The coalition must have decided for 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgement rendered.
The opposition criticised this time frame and tried to pressure the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The head of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be conditioned as a total failure to a given word.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the leader of the Tarek Al-Wazir Greens by alluding to the electoral slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's criticism that the Government of the Land is still trying to authorize night flights by using "vocassery and rublardism".
It takes time to conduct a precise legal review.
The coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. banks reimburse the aid allocated
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, lack their ties towards the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it has fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (over EUR 30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The American television channel CNBC reported that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to rid themselves of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of bonuses allocated to the leaders and the regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors who brought it $19 billion of fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's funds that are well filled through the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America, specifically wanted to thank US taxpayers: capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult time.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying the Merrill Lynch investment bank at its highest financial torment.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money on financial markets in order to free itself from State guardianship.
The U.S. bank could thus launch an increase in capital of $20 billion on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain citing banking environments.
Citigroup's spokesman did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley reimbursed their public funds.
Accelerated election
Finally everything happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the limoge of the current post of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German ZDF chain, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wished to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who led the Berlinese writing of ZDF, was the great favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further harm the manager of the ZDF Markus Schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the writing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed support for the re-election of Brender and 7 others had voted against. Brender's removal by vote was a well-predicted failure for Schächter.
In fact, the CDU, which is a majority at the Board of Directors, had already heard several weeks before the vote, did not want to reschedule Brender to his position.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief by referring to the fact that the rate of listening to ZDF's information emissions had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, fusing the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end, there were even 35 experts in public law who had joined the debate and who believed that Koch's way of doing things was unconstitutional.
But that wouldn't have been of any use.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, teaching and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked in Südwestfunk (Rhénie-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national newspaper).
In 1983 he became a editor in the ZDF first in the news magazine "heute-journal" (now newspaper).
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy of the editor-in-chief of the time; then he corresponded to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was chief and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (the bimonthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlinist writing.
After Brender's misfortune, while he had just been elected a journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent to the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the manager's staff proposals could not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF Monitoring Commissions.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor had skillfully managed with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with certainty in his decision to limoger Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as could the Board of Directors elect him without being suspected of placing a political partisan on the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left liberal.
Large cleaning in university studies
Part success for students: After one year of an educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors Conference, an agreement was developed that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination must allow the study module to be completed.
In addition, the workload will need to be recognised to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also undertook to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master branches.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have repeatedly expressed the expression in fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take concrete significance.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be completed by a single examination", which can be found in a document of about 30 pages on the future conditions for admission to university courses.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, derailments should be allowed to be stopped, which would significantly affect studyability.
The "studyability" should also be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background need to be carefully examined to see if you can't avoid this feeling of shock that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and flexibility to enable and promote the personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that in 2015 only all cycles will be reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes were not overburdened and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher schools have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
Rhénie-Palatinate has so far been the only country to have agreed to grant more means to develop the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programmes and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as review offices and international relations service
For this reason, the Länder and universities plan a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the Government wishes to submit an amendment to the law on higher education institutions to Parliament.
This will require only one examination to complete his studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, and it must be possible to ensure recognition of notes from other higher education institutions and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said that he would like to see the organization of education policy no longer happen in the future "after closed doors" of Ministers and university rectors.
Not later than after the educational strike, students as interested persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education were supported by the Chair of the delegates of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The student experience is very useful to us" said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls for the right and opportunity for each graduate Bachelor to register for a Master's Cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also requests that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students, that there will be enough space tomorrow for Master's studies and the conditions of studies as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that a work of poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematicized in brigades of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first German and English professor in Bucharest and then director of collection in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received several literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He had a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, the theme of which was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorted mirror of your security files".
Söllner made a statement in which he recognized his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer as an informer for the security policy police.
In 1989 Söllner received the German language price in conjunction with some of the participants.
The recruitment tests began insidiously in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner "so someone who has not been able to withstand the security intimidation tests."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honor of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary scraps with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the abyss and the lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victims.
In his own file Security, IM Walter played a role, ensures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He was able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however, the testimony of a former dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services is not in fact so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have speculated and sometimes guessed which real names were hidden last by the names of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
On the contrary, Germany where the consultation of Stasi's files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Security dossiers is still very confusing.
A systematic clarification has been constantly offset and restrained in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the institution of Birthler was set up to work on the Assimilation of Security Archives (CNSAS) but the return of files has been rather delayed since.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Romanian Security is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former security officer of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expresses himself in a very demeaning manner with respect to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and eventually she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power thought it could be expressed here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many outstanding issues are associated with the Söllner case as they occur so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been spoiled? Söllner's heavy reaction, in the presence of Söllner, hopes that the continuation of this chapter will be more defined by a thirst to know than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Tumults at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived there, shot at four pins coming right from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross went up to midnight minus the fourth in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the hand supplier.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, let himself be led into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he didn't drink alcohol and he wasn't drunk of happiness either.
He had a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because now it's gonna start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just begun three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth finish", that is, in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. This will be a brutal battle not to return."
The "big job" awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is about repeating in Mainz the results of the league of champions daily.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have surfaced after the three Expeditioning Goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing of lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ match return 9./10. + 16./17 March) will be fired on the fate on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminating entry into office of the successor of Babbel was therefore moderate.
And joy was not moderate only to one who had brought luck, who had passed on to the professionals of Stuttgart destabilized, unfavorable motivation and pleasure to play.
I've been seeing the players and told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "leader of souls" – Gross - the recipe for the success that sounded so but did no more effects with the Babbel nurse.
He triggered a certain magic, told Jens Lehmann - Babbel's partisan - "in the football when there is a new impulse there sometimes happens things that we would never have believed possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, advances to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tries to describe the " phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It is someone who passes into action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the lead yet, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad wake in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , object Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't gone through the hard way yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th anniversary did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home win for three months, is from the events of the weekend that a television interview by goal keeper Jens Lehmann caused rebound just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, would counter Heldt, in response to the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the management of style weakness and said she had decided to change coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the games had been eliminated.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure selfishness" ennobles Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two quadranters.
In any case, they agreed for the rest, i.e. without the prior work of the group by the replacement coach, the strong sport and combat representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in the success" retorting Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man in the plastic bag aquiesça.
World Heavyweight Championship
Warm combat in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his world champion title of heavy weights according to the WBC Federation version.
At the unanimous decision of the judges he imposes himself on points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his world heavyweight champion title.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at points unanimously against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defended his title with honour since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won twice the WBO and WBC World Championships.
Unfortunately he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, out 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, confesses twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat at the 24th combat.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, on its left side.
Johnson, 11 centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, succeeded in avoiding the hits of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from putting his dangerous right into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and in gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, and has passed with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital of Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko the treatant of "Vilain Zombie" who "is not really capable."
On Friday's day, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by dropping his eyeglasses "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko again imposed during his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a nearly four-year break, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered his WBC belt that he had had had before to give up without fighting.
This year, defending his title as a champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Areola of the USA.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," said Klitschko to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having detonated the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It seems that his promotional company is planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Gutenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and La Lefte parties (day Linke) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formed a crime" on the murder of two tank trucks last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the ARD chain information broadcast "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to the total disregard of the International Security Assistance Force rules in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the fragency was in fact not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air strike that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday, to speak to the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast believe that Ms. Angela Merkel should make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan government's policy if the chancellorship, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesperson categorically rejected these criticisms.
The chancellorship did not in any way influence the military intervention in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, more and more voices were being made to express doubts about the real reasons for the referral of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to SPIEGEL, the information they had sent to Gutenberg about the attack of tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hid some disturbing details from the Minister.
In the presence of the two senior officials, however, they heard that they had informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a military police report.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had in the meantime asked in a mail for clarification of the facts.
Up to now, it has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred the following Wednesday to the federal Parliament's commission of inquiry to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else can see or hear.
There is not only in the case of psychiatric patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our dark rooms, we can freely indulge in the worst dreams and fantasies.
But the one who, awake, makes the experience of a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychiatric or drug-related patients.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious awakening state, taking the form of a dream, can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called vision, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect are distinct, the visions of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is broken and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earthly Attraction Force no longer has power over the person.
From antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always focused on the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakening dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T becomes a character of a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions with the colors created.
Land attraction no longer has power over it, it plans at the level of the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him are creatures of wild devil, grumpy, bloody mouth, showing their teeth.
They pursue him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, feel pain in the whole body.
Voice thundering, mean, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls out two cables from its stereo chain, in fact a loop and attach it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He goes up on a waffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop's off.
That's a lesson for you, they shout their voices in a heart to pull out the tympan. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first one of 20 years soon.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoia, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics this is the most frequent disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which makes them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and ghosts from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
Schizophrene is at the heart of the situation, with a significance centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Experience once in his life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
The delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the life takes place in a real context.
Why does our brain make this kind of cabrioles, it's always a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have severe brain damage.
Neuron maturation of the brain is assumed to be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way the neuronal system anomaly occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience may be a psychosis trigger, if there is predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats.
What's crazy, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of viewpoint.
Kasten has been gathering reports for ten years on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucination is a very common phenomenon of psychosis but also an impressive number of other pathologies.
Psychic disorders such as borderline or depression are included, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when brain areas that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently cooled; when our brain heats but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledge that they have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. was 16 years old, she lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-Pomerania and went to high school.
A young girl who's always normal to tell.
If there were no images and voices.
During recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, sends him the word.
When she answers her friends, they look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young friendly.
I'm crazy, she's wondering sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
Often visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she happens to be unable to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is clearly explaining equations in the table.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and too late, she cannot often make the distinction if she is awake or already dreams, if the images she sees, the smiling faces or the girl with bloody details on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or her friends, they'd take her for a fool.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her baccalaureate last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she went online with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Folly is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is that they will have hallucinations after a certain period of time.
I assume that the brain is not quite busy, so there is animation.
Sarah K., a single girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was at the age of thinking, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form into the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not actual images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one gap between the dream and the hallucination.
In our far too conscious world we have unfortunately quickly tended to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and doctor at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains something positive, a creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called oniroid, a particular form of changing consciousness awakened by dream.
Oniroid vecus are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that they cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The state of oniroid consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy, they experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a state of mind boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
In fact, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an organizational capacity that is given to us men, so that we do not subside in the absence of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Changing of the Heart" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscious part for a journey several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body was condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world that he has created of all pieces, visits foreign places, travels over time. He sees himself as an old man nestled in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his head watch over his health.
He lives in mid-age among nobles who make blood-based drugs.
He is removed by a Greek motorcycle that takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the Alpine neve and meets a Korean mafia.
It completely absorbs in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen these internal journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a very different state, he writes in describing what he has lived through.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real life.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the oniroid deliriums, psychosis, hallucinations and psychiatric experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
First snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years of age, the children will follow up the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: Hubert Burda wants his two children to resume the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, the editor Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly committed to integrating society, said Hubert Burda, 69, at Spiegel.
All details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
We will also need to see if they are capable of this.
It is not possible to impose its children on 7500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to take care of them.
This would undermine children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position of President-Director-General from January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
He then dealt with the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time, it is not a family member who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children were 19 and 17 respectively, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
Ruins have always occurred in families that have been driven by a capital bubble, which have made huge unfortunate speculations by thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had a universal power dream, Burda said.
I do not see myself as a precursor of the country as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is the goal that seems to have been set by El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 devoted to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious signs such as Hedonai, laser hair specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a diet radius, with in particular a tea salon, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours in order to organize your own "Beautiful Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a Jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a champagne cup.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative face care, body care and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and extremities included) suffice to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after having our body worked, we want to go through the hair salon, the teacher Luis & Tachi has a room where the rituals of hair repair, luminosity or nutrition are offered, all customized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m.
Miscellaneous decollets
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The form of take-off, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated take-off. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with electric car
The endesa electric company, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric car in the city and will establish mobility agreements, taking steps, coordinating, providing grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, collect the views and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, within the framework of the MOVEL Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa is involved in the promotion of electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has undertaken a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero interviews "a future of tranquility" for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, interviewed "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, constitutes the country's main export sector.
At the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitiveness Plan of the automotive sector, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integrated Plan for the Automobile Sector (IPA), has devoted EUR 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in addition to Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 collection cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of collection cars, a meeting space for professionals and motorists.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pavilón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only motorcycles and collection cars can be found there, but also items of all kinds related to the engine world can be found in ClassicAuto Madrid.
Thus, in the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Classicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this trade show will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with automobiles and collection motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit arranged outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sport spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the engine shutdown and starter system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the engine 2.0 gasoline of 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained as a whole.
Details, vehicle finishing, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
By continuing with the whole set formed by the control panel and the console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Gulf of Volkswagen, that they all want to overcome.
By continuing with the room, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, there is a large box of regular forms.
The engine's automatic shutdown and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre petrol engine and 150 horses and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a true happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its benefits and its control over its consumption.
Although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and its master consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is Sportive, i.e. the model that presents the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the track change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive inner mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the audio bluetooth, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment was not sufficient, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional EUR 1,500, includes among other elements of the bi-xenon adaptable lights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by their behaviour and by their high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make a lot of kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, Sportive.
In return for this important amount, Mazda3 will give us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "First"
L.A. covers the red mat of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have us more than ever dazzling, dressed in elegant and sexy models for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark lady.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch its e-mail, without offering the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, or less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American great-brother, but he has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a café on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to see its mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it has been for a long time that it should work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the little characters.
The European Commission's repeated reminders to offer affordable roaming tariffs throughout Europe have had hardly a noticeable effect.
Outside her country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it's called Fon when it doesn't have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators start thinking differently and study various proposals that allow them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the download of books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no fee.
This is a connected device and is paid when it is purchased and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: an option to purchase with access to life as Peek already offers it in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to the position of Barack Obama in the U.S. presidency with a dress and coat of this color, she chose the same to accompany her in the second moment, no doubt the most important of her life: giving Oslo the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow drawing towards the green with bright reflections, twice, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So at first glance, it would seem that the first lady in the United States follows the steps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to return the same outfits.
But the fabric in which both sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick tooth for taking the job, it was, on the other hand, carrying a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium heel green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden model, this time.
The hair has changed as well: the hair is now removed while the hair is released the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had occupational problems due to their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women in younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Women's fertility and career in Spain" carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 did not leave any doubt: 75% of working mothers had a limited career because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences between the start of life in couples and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of employment employed.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have unstable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, repel the entry into marriage and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women aged 35 to 49 years of fixed employment have their first child, on average 3.7 years after they settled in a couple. This figure goes to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "This data shows that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exerted significantly affects maternity, but less the date of common beginning of life," says the researcher at CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that widens the age gap of women's marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who did elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have completed elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle-level or higher-level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several products of the brand, waving the universal motto "Because I value it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses in the international scene, comes to join other celebrities inscribed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were the actress Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetic brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, lessons of anatomy) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The prices of the UK fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, of yesterday and today, have met for the annual award, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one's missed the meeting.
Former Jerry Hall Mannequin and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Mannequin of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not according to predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summaries, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignominious core of the person created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither the losers nor the lights.
Delightful, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you a few instants here.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, which I felt without the name of it: pleasure against the funst destiny, moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in blood, not in the head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, devoid of sense, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman's passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre summits of universal literature, which must be gravitated by the north face, on which the best mountaineers are still and always taken."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer gathered the cry of discomfort pushed from a bridge by this Munch character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and did it in the flight of himself and invoking the posteriority with a violent speech to the asticians."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt on her knees and prayed: "Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved Spenser's worms: "Sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ rest after the war,/ after life, fatigued death torn."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband very normally agreed that she told her that Edward VII was lying between the azalleans or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent went beyond madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos if it was not to try to hide Joyce at Baroja?
What is Benet trying to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did this do if it was not to aspire to this man's glory to serve him as a pedestal?"
A cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a blood-male, saved from the SPA and no more than six kilograms, and without a word, they took him two kicks that left the dog severely wounded.
Our anger is immense because we do not see what there is to be fun to assault a defenceless little animal for free, which was also left behind.
This must be added to the indignation of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear them for her physical integrity, since an energetic attacker who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone weaker than him.
The episode took place about 17 hours, one Tuesday like another, in a neighborhood usually quiet.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have of course filed a complaint at the headquarters of the district even if we doubt that this is of great help and in order not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Indignantness has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to young people so they find it fun to treat a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keep us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the helmet port
The manufacturer of Michelin tires, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage helmet porting, mainly among younger motorcycle drivers, as mentioned today by the two structures.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributed to this objective by other educational and informational actions.
This new two-wheel helmet booster campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the widest circulation.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles progresses
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent a 12.6% increase compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the comparison reference in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (originating from passenger cars, pick-up cars, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
Large clouds that most affect their demand did not however disappear; indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100 per cent of cases thanks to external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of bank appropriations, other factors such as increasing unemployment or continuing poor economic conditions must be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E was of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of Co2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, they can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks of themselves.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we reiterated the need for administration to focus on these vehicles as well as on industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The concessionaires' association provides for a year 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (tourist vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this has happened with the ABS braking system and as it will be with ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its way of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency brake assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of emergency detected by the system through the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, one third of the drivers involved in an accident could not rely on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
Aid intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one out of four deaths with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, through a radar or camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors rejected the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the factory Opel de Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would need more time to complete the Opel relief plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, understands that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be made within the next few days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, is important.
In case there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a portion of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
On the fly of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left Boxster S and succeeded in pushing it with nothing less than 80 kilograms, leaving the balance of only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to move, first of all, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual crash roof, allowing them to reduce by 21 kilograms, to use aluminium doors like those of the GT3, 15 kilograms less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilograms, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilograms of wins, to mount sports bins, still 12 kilograms, and with light tyres of 19 inches, five kilograms.
Finally, they renounced the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six other kilograms and replacing the door handles with woven handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads of the secondary network of California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be judged to be irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with lead.
On the contrary, it had been a long time since we had not tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees so much security in the turns, including at high speed.
He's a little athlete, able to heat his muscles with a little speed for the time needed, until we ask him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to his leadership, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands will show on the wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Willing engine sound
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or with a system that changes the engine rusting, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether stopped or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The road cover we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed well the chicken nests.
The electronic assistants were barely present on the whole journey, while on some turns we found verglas in the morning and gravel later in the morning.
Finally, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive and that is much more than a simple modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
Bag Girl
Karl Lagerfeld's intimate friend, Coco Cocoon line icon and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her face as a bad girl with as much restraint as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a triumph at 91-82 during his visit to Maccabi Electra's hard terrain, despite the many absences of Dusko Ivanovic's team. This led to his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show, which, with eight baskets at three points, was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team has been able to fill up the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large amount of collective engagement and work, even though she had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill since the perimeter, with 16 baskets at three points marked, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blue and red, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four packs of the Vitoria team had been marked since the perimeter, it was alleged that they had jumped to the Israeli field with their hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second fourth time was in the same tone, but the team of Alava chose the internal game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by acclamations and applauses back to his old house, to increase their benefit at break (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to be noted as his team's best player, with 13 points marked, although the "less six" of Splitter's evaluation already suggested that this night would not be the best of Brazilians.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at pause, nothing was played, far from there, and the team of Avala wanted to remind Vitoria that they did not win so easily on their ground, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the benefit of the yellows on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from being killed, needed to chain some skilful actions to take the air, and it was at that time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged, which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas sends the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises succeeded in increasing at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team came out to play everything for the last time, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) informed them that they were not going to let anyone take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defend well, and although the Israelis drew close during the last minute (80-85), the party was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Wounds prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja suddenly lost in Greece against Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of Euroliga, during a match marked by the absences of players from Unicaja, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and having a large budget.
The first-quarter-time game allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets at three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the internal game of Bouroussis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between North American drivers Beverley and Williams led to disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team started working by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury to the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults weighed on the Unicaja.
The interior players and the Lithuanian wingmen Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the advantage 44-32, at the nineteenth minute.
A climb impossible
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, stood higher and even equaled the difference in the dispute meeting held in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, bringing the group's head to chance.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, to Cook's three-point baskets, and to Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos proved implacable when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic succeeded in resetting the score to 81-62, to thirty-seventh minutes, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympics.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate ads, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates the wages of users from more than 140,000 job offers available in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For one week now, the search engine has, in general, found that the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a press release Trovit's product manager, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available From its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spaniards are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid job in Spain is that of a server, with 11,592 euros net annually, followed by that of a seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought jobs on the Internet over the last three months are drivers, middle-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overturned President will have to give up the diplomatic legacy by 27 January 2010 at the latest on the date of the formal end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed on TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, after his term of office, he must seek another destination."
The chain also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as quickly as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by telephone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the political exile that he intended to impose upon him the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After pink days since last spring, during which the inflation of the assets constituted the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty arose again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where the agents make decisions on a future by nature uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetaryize debt through direct acquisition of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at zero-near rates, so that financial institutions would purchase assets to be mobilised.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically finalised and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, begin to put some sand into the wheels, as the ECB did, with their award a year from next week.
As a result, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing an inverse reduction in risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the deviations from the obligations of companies are increasing again, although they remain very far from the standard levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is again an overflight towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were the shelters chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a new revision to the lower qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence moral risk defenders, who were again trying to raise a case of conscience among those responsible for global economic policy that had hindered the destructive effects of the limitation of credit on job destruction, whereas what should be done is a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is similar to a tribal struggle between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot to roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly unreasonable for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country in the euro area to fail to comply with its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gap increases to the extent of European business obligations, we do not have to worry.
If European disparities were to decline and ours continued to increase, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdotal. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise their forecasts upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who come back to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not have much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "precaution is mother of certainty".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy is discussed these days for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched out for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission, eightfold.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million up to 2020 and an additional EUR 60 000 million between that date and 2030, in case nuclear power plants today in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 000 million but to 95 000.
However, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 on, the issue is changing, and power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, he considers that 18 000 MW are needed, with other "support energies".
Galán, who considers that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his business demands, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate warming policies.
According to him, there is a "long-term clear bet" in this regard, despite the "pointual" measures, as the President of Iberdrola has described them.
In any case, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they take some time before reaching maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, will play the leading partner role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been disclosed, is five years long.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million up to 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to carry out energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes for its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession motorway in Australia, on which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site is an estimated tunnel of 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a public works and motorway dealer.
The mayorate of the city wishes to be able to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to US$ 1,700 million (about €1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortia, with a remarkable presence of European manufacturers.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in line, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the greatest European underground work specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Austrian Leighton (filial of the German builder Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of CSA), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market is promising major construction and privatization, but entering is a major challenge if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, mentioned above, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an invalid stage for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a seat on this market by participating 30% in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Actiona focuses on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind turbine park, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and directs the grouping of companies responsible for building and managing Adelaide's desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Bureau of Infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and the so-called Northern Link (northern link), is called to link the western highway of Toowong to the highway to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll route will be opened at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise two routes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to have much fruity Hochtief, which mentioned yesterday the obtaining of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fibre-optic broadband network.
This intervention will allow 400 000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has given up the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been responsible for the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the construction site is scheduled for early 2010 and its completion will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is being awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to Mrs Rushmore's agency for a budget of about three million euros a year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been selected from 16 agencies that have submitted themselves to the call for tender organized by Renfe, including four finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity in the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million in France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes in the margins of regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still a state enterprise accumulates more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles that it poses to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivised.
An app shop
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephone subsidiary followed the tracks of other operators and opened an Internet app shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
At the start, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has contributed 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth positions of the clubs that took the most money into this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income of major clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated €5,362.5 million to 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish teams) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to earn the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams who also billed the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including the Madrid Atlético) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only to be there, plus 550 00 euros for each game.
There is also a win bonus (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in eighth finals perceive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in quarter finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça seized 2.5 million for winning the Europe Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each TV market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and it has four attractive places.
The champion of the previous year is 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid on the basis of the number of games played during the current year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the supply of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9 % of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company has stated that it has made contact with the regulator.
If necessary, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure his leadership.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible offers of purchase and of the court of his former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as an internal audit director.
A decision made by the first woman to occupy a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months His will reveal new diversions of funds cannot be removed.
Regarding credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes the OPA for the exclusion of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the existing standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory record submitted as a result of the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95 % of social capital, consisting of 6 142 786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao fellowships.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized, and that they could not in any way be transmitted before the end of the offer, which he stated was that the price had been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex work.
To calculate by hand the cost of a repair of between 20 000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor may take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest IT tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then to process them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Commercial Director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car goes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work, as each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and the price entered.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image of each model is established on which you can click on the different parts of a tourist car.
If it is a model sold massively, work can be ready within a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it's a cheap car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99 %.
In order to carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each is specialized in certain brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million per year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to offer different uses and various products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the countries, there are also tools for the management of broken parts or for the calculation of the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does so in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the lighthouse product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for assessing claims, for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the painting scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly chain only through its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is an open-source server to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to hit broken vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geo-demographic analyses or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a specified trademark have gone to the garage for a failure or how many have suffered severe losses for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimante, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and time.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, failures or maintenance of motor vehicles.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a landmark product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased by 20% per year over the past three years, and it has made a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is achieved in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Reportex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive €19.1 million, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed in the $1,000 million stock exchange, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has joined the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auctions of injured cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimating and selling service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cassettes and professional sellers who are required to be registered before starting operations.
This platform was set up in 1996 in Germany and operates more than 650 000 operations throughout Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
He manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed after complex approaches.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are resistant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are needed.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour prices, increases or reductions, then he can print the currency to deliver it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the Audatex company works to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
