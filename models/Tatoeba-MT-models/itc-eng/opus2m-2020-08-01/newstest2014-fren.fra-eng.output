Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" above Bogota
The sportsman Jonathan Florez jumped on Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a Wingsuit (a combination with wings), it passed to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located more than 3,000 metres high, where many badauds had gathered to observe its exploitation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners have a hard time finding the money they need to repair the self-infrastructure in decreption, many are those who interview a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above the board of your car.
The aircraft, which record all the miles through a car and transmit the information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the government planning offices to revise the obsolete financing system of the major U.S. roads.
The generally uninterested sector in the planning of major axes has suddenly led to a strong debate and lively alliances.
The libertarians joined green groups to press for the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly of the road you travel on, and then use the information to write a bill of taxation.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
While members of Congress were unable to agree on whether to continue, several States did not wait.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental shift.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It's not like we had a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, who plans that the state will start recording the miles through every Californian car by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded by the American pump taxes, is financially dry.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they did before.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 percent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His State has recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
"This turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage usage fee.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces urban Liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious climate warming laws.
But representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
The open market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of getting drivers paid by mile.
"It's not just a tax in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, policy vice president at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for their benefits.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the way to the mile payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which would have covered approximately 10,000 cars.
But the House Presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many miles every day to get to work or in town.
However, several States and large cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to deliver the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay to the State of kilometres instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is planning one.
Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States along the coast is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studying how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their least actions and actions.
"Big Brother's concerns and such things are a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategic performance management in the Nevada Transportation Department.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full location devices."
It is not necessary to build a huge and enveloping technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep people's daily records.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now moving to find an affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles a car travels, but not knowing where or exactly the time.
If we can do this, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small start-up in California named True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not intended to assist motorists who pay taxes to States.
She sought to enter the emerging market of self-insurance, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices it tests have favored the planners of the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive means and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try their experience by offering car drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other States hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by enabling devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking costs, provide "payment to the pipeline" insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits offered by the system," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the entire debate on mile payment is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say that Congress could simply manage the Highway Trust Fund bankruptcy by increasing fuel taxes.
A single or additional annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays their share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when we simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs at the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unheard Listeners
The English musician did not finish to surprise this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he co-concocted a luxury edition scheduled for November 4, with several unpublished ones.
Four have already emerged on the Toile.
The announcement of David Bowie's release of a new album had left everyone Pantois.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, date 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to spark the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one lap in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to re-edit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he had a real party for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four already released clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and folders, a notebook to share its own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, above all, it gives a foretaste of its new title Atomic, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a cleverly mastered rock electricity.
Unpublished Already Listening
But Atomic is not the only title to reveal his charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informar is double-faced: a worrying intro before a light ride that progressively slows down to make room for a pop ball.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, even to Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie again referred to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, enveloping, desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie is in any case amusing to play the chameleon with these titles: turn-in informant, man on a rocket, potential marc...
He conceals and reveals both, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in hand in the photograph of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, of the Louis Vuitton brand, of which he embodies the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from 10 November.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not substantially released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - who do not comply with the army's "university of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, has been released from the army despite his demand for an additional year to be able to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary commission last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not respond to the universal rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with La Presse Canadienne on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been unable to determine the latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not able to fight.
Under the current rules, severely injured soldiers are up to three years old to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year to Parliament indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 did not reach the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
The Liberal spokesperson for former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, asked on Wednesday for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while the neo-Democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney put on the tablets to launch a animated series
The American Media and Entertainment Group has decided to focus the tablets on its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is only scheduled in 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior Division.
The cartoon for children aged 2-7 relates the adventures of Callie, the sheriff of a city in the western United States where she makes her order with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two stories of 11 minutes.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice President of Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifetime of his series and build new relationships with his audience through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already been using a tablet or telephone, and 72% of those under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% of them two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. information service denouncer, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbel met on Thursday Mr Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
The relations between the United States and Germany were put to the test as a result of complaints that the NSA had posted on the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who runs the parliamentary group that oversees foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States," he had to take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, German Green MP, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that according to former NSA consultant counsel, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden was testifying in Germany, he should be assured that he would be in "safety" there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a "severe and sustained" persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public use.
The letter advances an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers might have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix's on-demand video service via their television in a future that doesn't seem so far away.
The subsidiary of Cogeco reported on Thursday that she was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and more options," explained Cogeco's president and CEO Louis Audet in interview.
Cogeco Cable thus envelops its competitors, like Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary has not yet a specific date in relation to this new platform.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Mr.Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The Rogers Telecommunications Giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service claims to be in discussions with some major cable players to make its service available through their broadcasting platforms.
Mr. de Cogeco and Mr. Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay on-board services.
"It was about two and a half years ago that we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important channels packages, that doesn't work," said Mr.Audet.
He hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission (CTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"There will have to be a new kind of reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," Cogeco said.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco reported having recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is a decline compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢ per share, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline due to depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired in 2012 the Atlantic Broadband cabler, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they experienced a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to up to 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢ per share, in comparison to 45.7 million, or 93 ¢ per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet doesn't worry about seeing the number of clients fluctuating like that.
For me, this is not the indication of a trend change, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very intense competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat was detected in beef-based cans sold by two small British low-priced distribution brands, today announced the Food Hygiene Agency.
Routine tests revealed that products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save channels, contained horse DNA of between 1 and 5%.
"As the horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes exploded in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests in Ireland.
According to examinations by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles struck four injured, early Friday, on road 131, in Lanaudière.
Just before 4 a.m., an automobile driver traveling north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car arriving in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The traffic had returned to normal around 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand baggage
Border Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand baggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for hand baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its ad Wednesday, she indicated that passengers could take the cane unopened with them to the descent of the aircraft.
The new hand luggage charges relate to the bags placed in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if costs were paid in advance and $100 if travellers only paid at the boarding door.
Frontier's spokesperson Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 was planned to induce travellers to pay the costs in advance.
"We don't want to pay this prize," she explained.
The airlines started paying for the first and second baggage recorded in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these fees put as many things as they could in the handbags arranged in the upper compartments, so there was often no place in these compartments.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers transport fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new expenses will not really be used to collect money.
It is about making it more and more difficult to find a place in the upper compartments to understand the most faithful Frontier customers.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger tailing a Frontier boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these costs before arriving at the door.
Frontier's luggage charges will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often do so about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage maintenance costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay.
Many people on Wall Street consider adding baggage costs as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them did not affect baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such costs is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to Jay Sorensen airlines, who closely follows the additional charges.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit's hand-held baggage costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines framework, recently travelled to Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the costs of unusual hand baggage imposed by the company.
"I had never seen such a smooth boarding procedure of my entire professional career," he said.
I expected to see tooth scratches and a fight break out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers are mounted on board at the speed of the lightning."
Border also acts as Spirit and applies $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened cane with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after the passengers complained and when no other large airline followed.
Frontier's decision to pay for hand baggage when passengers do not purchase their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to purchase directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the premiums of thousands by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250-mile.
It also allows passengers to choose their seats in advance only if they purchase their tickets directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in his hometown, Denver, but his activity goes back and she loses money.
Revenues fell by 9 per cent and their flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent during the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic has tried to redress Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA challenges an "internal error" rather than computer pirates for the failure of its website
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that had caused the failure of its public site for a few hours, not hackers like some had claimed it online.
"NA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," said the spy agency in a declaration by email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed service denial attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been broken for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesperson.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site due to a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to inundate a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the system.
The previously ultra-secret NSA, once known as the "No Such Agency", found itself under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticized over the past few months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications surveillance programs at national and foreign levels – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former failed consultant of the NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency caused a lot of speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville Hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who are going to turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let his employees fall.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, met employees individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," says the Regional Director of Work Relations of the Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta intervenes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza that will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will see the day in two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employees"
After casting the sponge with failure in January for the partial recovery of the Goodyear site of Amiens-North promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tyreman Titan, today declares himself ready to save 333 jobs out of the 137th factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After giving up the factory purchase project in January, you are back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "foo" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this flip-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, he is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs from the best paid jobs.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours disabled in France.
In India, China and in all other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a proper price and competent workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the factory closing announcement, Goodyear had offered employees a good starting allowance, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys Goodyear the closed factory.
As a result, Titan could move machines to Poland or any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from some 1,200 of Goodyear's current employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan commitment before trying to get the CGT to sit down with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on departure allowances for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he wants a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the project to purchase the factory starts with zero employees.
How can we provide job-time guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg achieves that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the factory, we intend to stay in North Amiens for more than four years.
The profit of Bombardier is declining, while deliveries and aircraft orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure of a decrease in orders and aircraft deliveries during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains Division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft would meet its ambitious schedule of commercial service before September.
After the opening flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the test aircraft only stole three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was in progress.
The results were not in line with the forecasts and the stock exchange declined by 8% to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his score on Thursday from "performance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential of the scholarship in the next quarter or the next two quarters.
"Although the decrease in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding energy efficiency and the potential savings of the new line plane.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft is put into commercial service.
Leaders also reassured analysts and media on Thursday by telling them that the program was moving in accordance with the timetable.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than planned," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's stopping time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and plan an update period, and that is what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes should fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly afterwards, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first client can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was evaluating the schedule of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This flight test slow – although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal calendar – reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter closed on September 30, Bombardier's net profit dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The adjusted result by action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues declined slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 Md.
Analysts expected a 10-cent result per share and revenues of $4.56 Md, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 one year earlier.
The net controls fell on 26 planes, compared to 83 earlier.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division represented $32.9 Md as at 30 September, an unchanged figure compared to 31 December of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
The revenues of the Aeronautics decreased by 13 per cent to $2 Md.
Bombardier, the world's largest rail builder, said that the revenues of this division had increased from nearly 11% to 2.1 Md$.
The order book of the Transport Division totaled $32.6 Md as at September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered from implementation problems with some major contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
The course of Bombardier's actions, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc, would sit on the board of directors, dropped from 8.5% to $4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported on Thursday a 10% decrease in its quarterly profit.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists had been missing in a dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, learned Friday from the Isère's rescue Speleo.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one war in practice and the other no, had left underground Thursday around 9:30 in order to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then. The same source has been specified.
"The speleologists should have emerged around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the Speleo rescue organization.
Tens of people on site
About 20 rescuers, ten civilians members of the French rescue Speleo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the relief teams involved in the network," says Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Mountain Hunters were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They lost in the network, turned back on their steps pending the rescue, specified the prefecture.
Refueled, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalist union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services on Thursday, following further revelations on the activities of American and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and couriers until new orders," she says in a communiqué.
She found "scandalous" Washington Post information, according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headsquarters (GCHQ) collected mass information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 members.
Repents: a member of Parliament requests Brigitte Gruoulls' resignation
The project by Minister Brigitte Gruoutells of "relevating" the signaling beams in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday to paint 16 red and blue signposts in the region.
The goal being both "to increase security" and "the Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the end, to repaint all Brussels signaling lamps at an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands Brigitte Gruoutells' "submission".
"It is not happy to spend the money of the Brusselses crazy in relief operations of signaling poles in the colours of the Bruxelles Region, Brigitte Groulets continues his operations of Flemishing the Capital," said Mr. De Bock in a communiqué.
After her black-yellow-yellow taxis, she finally painted herself in dark-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-
According to the Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselses deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who itself realizes the NVA program.
It's a long time to stop the Trojan horse from Flanders.
"To remember, Brigitte Gruowels was elected only with 2,245 votes 0.5% of the Brusselses!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the portico de Pont-de-Buis demonté
The portico ecotaxe of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday morning, was dismantled.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national was diverted in the wake.
The decommissioning decision, announced by the Prefecture of the Finistère Wednesday, was made by the company Ecomov, the portico manager.
This is the last of the three ecotax ports to operate in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory shop for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google signed online glasses.
They can thus acquire an earphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This boutique, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers a few accessories such as a USB charger and cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of microfibre or an intra-auricular headset.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father wiped out the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it, or rather I didn't know how I was going to keep dating him.
There is no recipe, no mode of use to pass the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that never leaves me, laid on the night table.
It's the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my everyday actions.
Our mother left us after her exhausted fight against cancer.
It's at least what I thought on the day I found her body empty, spit on this hospital bed with cold sheets.
Similarly, his funerals were a glacial farewell focused around the lean glow of the candles that would fit his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, day or night appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she resumed her place in the landscape of my thought that she believed in mourning.
And then she turned out to me while revealing my own faces that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person at all but simply a woman I did not really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This diversion from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "in and out" he seemed.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a hard relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I wasn't afraid of him anymore, and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He talked to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived my body.
I saw his hands looking at my own, and I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said that dead people are not forgotten but invisible people.
My parents are no longer but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always mean it: what would they say? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I dream of them constantly, perhaps not every night, but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, only, there's always something that prevents me from fulfilling this moment.
I often wake up anxiously when it happens to me and deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and are part of my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I was supposed to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I would wake up, I was going out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the stage and he was smiling and glad I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he was happily sharing what was coming to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I liked sharing this moment with him and I enjoy telling this common memory that he lived after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
I've still realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of making a master's degree in a great school, have not been, with the decline, an anodized choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where he had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I can think about how she would like me to act at a given time.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be up to the generosity and the rightness of mind of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes set on me.
My mother died 17 years ago.
Death after talking to me on the phone.
I went through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that triggers alone, wherever, whenever, in unusual places, in incongruous moments.
Then time calmed down.
Only the lack, the lack of response, the need for it, the need to trust me, to reassure me of its sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his anxious eyes set upon me, I see the circles that glaring his gaze, the wrinkles around the lips that dig cigarettes, the folds that mark the front of the days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes around.
My wife and mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his pain bed, so we were little to smile again, and saying his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to him in the dark when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself in my dreams when morals are a little hit.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the decline of time makes us realize how much she was head of orchestra and we try to stay on the path she had drawn us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot take it away from your heart and memories.
In some ways, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 in the aftermath of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my own beliefs sometimes different from his own, I still wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep, and I always wonder what he'll think.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any case, he'll always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
It was soon 30 years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6 years old.
The immense penalty that invaded me then, of course, has eased, but it is always close to me.
Very often he "debarts" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that in the wake I am even more sad to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was doing well, I said no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in surprise, anxious and lit the hair lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I go back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all the parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and or his mind lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since my departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a professional responsibility, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about except him with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the most deadly month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the President of the United States.
Noury al-Maliki wants US help.
"We don't tell the world to be with us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what's going on in Iraq is not settled, it's going to spread, and what's going on in Syria is going to spread too.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Peace Institute, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded banners accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
He was sentenced to three-year imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Sieges
A major defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough concerning investigations into his drug trafficking activities after having compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was known as "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "priority file", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police hearing operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officials found Sarborough, 32 years old, laying three cocaine bags at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a bar dinner with friends.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, her wallet and her credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to the criminals because she feared that her drug abuse would be revealed on a large day.
Today, at Liverpool's Court of Appeal, Ditta, who works in Forbes Solicitors' law firm in Blackburn, fell into disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of arrest to justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, up to 60%, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, the Blackburn Rovers club's precinct.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug, and telephoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, her wallet and her credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He said that he had spoken to the drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta collected his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a sample of hair was taken from him.
In an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that he was called by clients for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that it called for major actors in the drug trade, some of whom it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "If anyone needs to know that there's no need to break the law, he's a criminal lawyer."
Mr.Detta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications would undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour his profession, but dishonored him.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and let his independence become compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr.Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal himself as soon as he started taking drugs from criminal organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has never compromised it and made it vulnerable to the background of the leaders of the organized criminal groups who have commissioned it to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of confidence with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter himself behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation of Mr.Detta, who was found guilty of the three chiefs of cocaine possession and now being detained, which attested to his commitment to prosecuting criminals in court.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself during which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death corridor in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be on stage in December
Detroit News reports that the queen of the soul will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board room of the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
Ms. Franklin spoke in November about recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering, the famous performer of Respect had stated to the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She says she's happy to be back.
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometres of seaboard covered with a light coat: we could cool the hot blow in Menton with the bill of lighting.
An invoice which, unlike many communes, is further regulated by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To alleviate its costs, the city uses leds.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 in the morning when a man opened the fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 injured.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the perpetrator.
The incident would have occurred at terminal 3, causing a panic wave.
Travellers and staff rushed to exits or on the tarmac.
Very soon the police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being stopped.
Classic song for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele who will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five saynnetes imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, cartoons with a high amount of humor allow teenagers to appreciate classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Kingdom lyric Art Society will return with its lyric Destinations, a formula that now fills the Chicoutimi Pulpery.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, which gives artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the lyrical Appéro, the concert-benefic held last August, with the support of the soprano colorature Marie-Eve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air from the bat.
Without delivering specific figures, the president of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future looks good, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
"Finances are floating and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operation, a step that we will take in seven years," said the administrator.
"I'd say even beyond," added CEO Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy de Surrey School faced six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, threat-pronouncement, weapon-bearing in a dangerous purpose, abduction, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Package.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective redress against the Saint Croix brothers
A new application for collective redress was filed against Saint Croix's brothers, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at the Saint Joseph's oratory, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The petition is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J. J"., which would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first to Our Lady-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Submitted, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the address of Saint Joseph, where he was serving as a Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was about only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people told us: "I, I was at this place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both cases.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has as a particular feature allowed the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Saint Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together complaints from 25 persons who claim to have been assaulted by the Saint Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal further points out that the congregation of Saint Croix and the oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "has allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised moral, religious and psychological restraint on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and have nevertheless choked them", and that they have "sciously and consciously chosen to ignore the problem".
These charges are based, among other things, on letters written by St. Croix's lawyer, Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research carried out in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of St. Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective appeal must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility is admitted by the Court, the second stage is the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Saint Croix had agreed to settle the matter in a friendly manner before hearings were held on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in the LaSalle district in Montreal on Thursday night through Friday.
The rescue was called around 1h, Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The 30 firemen who were dispatched to the premises have spent about an hour in control of the brewery.
The fire caused "significant damage to the structure of the building," indicated the chief to the operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but almost twenty houses, located on the first and second floors of this range of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments might have to be temporarily housed, the SIM indicated.
A lot of opposition to medical aid to die at Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is held this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote on the principle of the Medical Assistance Bill to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would like to end their days, according to a spokesman from the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
Most palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care House Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also Director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie House in Gatineau, believes that the service would be in any way unnecessary.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick First, believes that the Quebec Bill disorients the population with regard to the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will take the step.
On the other hand, Liberal MP of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the concept of end of life must be clarified before the bill is adopted.
Kenya's press is ignoring the controversial media law
"It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask itself the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper by challenging the bill and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we refuse it," explained Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent news radio stations and websites.
He indicated that the new media court "will always be biased as it is a government extension" and that content and advertising restrictions would harm Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have "media support". The Standard stated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and forged the bill calling it "draconian".
The adoption of the bill is taking place at the same time as a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate trading centre last September.
Kenyan media has aroused the anger of the authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack stole so-called the luxury shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media officer to interrogate them, although the summons were withdrawn following a riot in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "done" or unable to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's animated blogosphere.
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, political men would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and collecting."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of people's anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Wages Commission and restored their outstanding wages of about 532,000 shillings per month exempt from tax – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of close to 10 pharmacists from the Laval Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) caused a great deal of attention to the management of the City of Health Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement leave, maternity leave or early departures, the department of pharmacy has found itself highly staff-deficit.
Almost 30% of the necessary staff were missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to engage in self-employment, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
No use was made of the deployment, explained Ms. Beaudet.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or reduced, as long as things move.
We certainly worked hard to interest our young people [pharmacy residents] in order to come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is clearly easier for the department of pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now, it's going a lot better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures from last year.
Always Growing Needs
However, the situation remains sensitive.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in the hospital or a predominance of young women in the trade, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and many young women are employed, so with pregnancy, we almost always drive three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
In the last year, we had a lot more, and we don't have any pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was harder.
The top 22-year-old model does not start his career in cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose him to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaiac, his next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will emerge in two strands (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadragenaire accruing to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's appearance with his elder is striking: a bead silhouette, a diaphne dye and French-English origins.
Not forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to put naked on ice paper will be displayed in much more sulphurous situations on large screen.
An extract from Nymphomanic caused temperature to rise on the Toile: Stacy Martin appears in the bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their powder in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all bodies digitally: above the belt, it's the star; below, the fold.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of pushing her actresses in their last retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin didn't finish talking about her.
A room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday evening
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precaution, as a result of pictations at the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility ordered the evacuation of the room and warned firefighters for a suspicious odor.
About 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad lacrymogenic jet bottom joke?
Or involuntary incident?
It is always that film management has played the principle of caution and the safety of its customers in full.
The room was airborne and everything went into order.
The cinema was able to resume its rights and customers find the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into citrus fruit
Taking advantage of Halloween's day, one woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine hidden in citrus trees at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the passenger baggage examination that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been distributed into three citrols which had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the office of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) who took over the relay in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, spokesperson for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region made a total of 1653 seizures of narcotic drugs.
Air raid against military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early in the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range ground-air missiles SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of Tsahal's aviation in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to Israel's daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in almost the same circumstances as the one that had taken place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed an Israeli attack at CNN, this time targeting Yakhont ground missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered Ukraine's solvency note on Friday, questioning the capacity of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt rating goes to "B-", focusing on the speculative investment category.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least one of three chances that it will again be reduced by one year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external funding needs," the US agency explains.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities rely massively on to support the local currency, hryvnia, collapseing, the agency increasingly considers a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in fiscal deficit, has for months called for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it a loan of $15.3 billion in 2010 and has now only released $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, especially by increasing the prices of gas to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important external financing needs" were "vulnerability", while "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect a short-term improvement".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with presidential elections scheduled in 2015, the expert interviewed at the PSA.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions for the release of opponent Iulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be short- and medium-term negative consequences related to Russia's reaction," said S&P, who fear "commercial restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which represents one quarter of Ukrainian exports, warned that in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. Green Fire at the Merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday that they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus bringing closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger actually brings together the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group et Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the previously announced merger review period of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", both groups announce in a communiqué.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for carrying out the operation.
"The merger is also conditional upon obtaining other regulatory authorizations and approval of shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolese army hunts the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units were going to hunt down the rebels from M23 to their bases located in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 is about to be beaten after being driven from the north-east parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that it has been controlling the insurrection 20 months ago.
"We're going to pursue the M23 and shelter it wherever it hides because it's criminals," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, FARDC spokesman to Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
Time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the villages under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, affirmed that these military setbacks would not in any way change his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Hangings are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of the M23 began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, chief of the Province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the Blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staffing, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade consisting of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC staff was re-elected and the army moved to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to touch its end," predicted a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has succeeded in defeating a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
Experts from the United Nations accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 militarily as a result of former Congolese mutiny troops.
British diplomacy leader William Hague invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, announced a spokesperson for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali referred to the possibility of military reprisals following shells in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived one year with the M23 and it seemed impossible for us to be one day liberated by the army," testified a resident of this neighbouring Ugandan town.
"We have lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized," said this man.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a suspected coronovirus infection were negative, announced by the Ministry of Health.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of having reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second American oil company, reported on Friday a decrease in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refinery margins, while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining withdrawn from the group's objectives.
Its net profit in the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, $2.57 per share, against $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, rising from the 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
The profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while the profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday a net profit falling, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has been demanding from the beginning of the school year the costs of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students with two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is in a position to do so.
Before changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," says Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to work together and to find solutions," says Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency of the Hotel-Dieu
In the face of the many months-long shading of staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "declare the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date for the closure of emergencies that will not be possible on 4 November".
An official request "to take no risk of emergency management in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed to avoid hindering the PS campaign to a few months of municipalities.
Despite ministerial requirements, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even though the APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of 4 November, firefighters who provided approximately a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency crossings at the Hotel-Dieu will have all received to carry the thirty serious cases daily to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hotel-God, emergency clinics will leave room on Monday to five general medical interns.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th," says Loïc Capron, the president of the PHAC's medical institution (CME) committee, who supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome emergency patients," he said, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will stay on site, he will also make sure.
But it is up to the ARS to decide to close the emergency reception service.
"Things take place gradually," said Nicolas Péju, spokesperson for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or lied to him," laments the emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Leaving his position as head of the SMUR in early July for having led the fender against the reorganization project, he defined himself as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision made by "medical and administrative technology".
"They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renewed less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly fattened.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for Lariboière emergencies.
In the ARS, it is argued that 30 patients "dispatched" on several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
At RSA and APHP, the "new hospital model" that has been on the way since October 7 is being defended and which is expected to continue to host 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, Liberal generalist doctors should also be involved in the establishment of an "ambulatory care stay".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnosis," Gerald Kierzek asks, for whom "the concept of non-severe emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen like for level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the armet, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a UMP advisor from Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Paris UMP were to maintain emergencies at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if responsibility is returned".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled again on Monday morning about France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, she would indicate her net disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, her spokesperson.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable schedule of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama ends listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume its hands in the NSA hearing case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
When asked about this, a head of the U.S. administration replied: "The United States does not carry out electronic surveillance for World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Expressing himself under the seal of anonymity, he did not specify whether such surveillance had been established in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered that these practices be discontinued over the past weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as that at the end of the hearings of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes on Thursday but allowed them to continue.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are authorized to collect and have imposed a five-year limit for the retention of such information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations will now work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were established 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began on the eve of Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final preliminary draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was time to "overstep national interests".
"I am glad that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These DDGs will build on the progress made within the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that underpin the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing while there are conflicts between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, who was torturing them, thousands gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public event.
"We want peace to return; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment company.
Concerned about her country's future, she exchanged her work clothes against a t-shirt with the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd lying in place of the Independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, almost every day there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst hangings since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia governed by whites and then the South African apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have shocked foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 million in investments over the next years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko from the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo have mutually rejected the responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is at the root of recent clashes and has launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesperson of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflict, and accuses him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza said on Wednesday to the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "lost" who wanted to use "all the remaining forces to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the peace agreement in 1992.
He told the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties failed to ease the tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep fighting," explained Joseph Hanlon, an open and specialist university speaker in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of votes collected by Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to obtain a greater number of votes in elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has led to disturbing lightning attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway axis.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is, the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
"People think that the people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is the latter to find solutions to problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestant, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "lifestyle models," says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "the brutal force does not weigh on the subtle russian", while the arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland advocated a "mindful selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been in favour of this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "openly didactic" makes children "completely catch up", the messages being "published" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or done well, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
And it must be underlined; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The well-known basis for what is shown and what is not said.
A fighter from the Hamas armed branch was killed tonight and another injured by an Israeli tank shot in the Gaza Strip, learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they carried out an Israeli armoured shell.
NSA espionage: The United States is "too far away", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" on espionage, acknowledged State Secretary John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant it to you, as the President did, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this will not happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London which he was participating in since Washington on Thursday, October 31, by video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified information and information collection practices through the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since played out numerous attacks projects through the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects," the US diplomacy boss argued.
And, John Kerry said to Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"Yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," said the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal on a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured on Thursday evening that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and undertake a review of these practices so that no one feels wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to rage this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former consultant of NSA Edward Snowden, states that the programme named "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by internet giants.
Some 181 million items were collected during the last month of January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These intercepts would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have shown that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. President was not aware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this issue, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have seized of these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and that would not mean Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread Friday in Asia.
Indonesia has called on the Australian ambassador, whose mission is to be used by the Americans as part of a vast international spy network that has also raised China's area.
The Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without his master's skill, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League 1 club in a communiqué.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco as opposed to goals, broadcasted the list of players selected for this 12th day match, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The communiqué simply states that it is "stricken", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee on his return to selection, at the beginning of months.
A ceremony in memory of the creamized deceased
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 hours, a lay ceremony, in memory of all the deceased creamized in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, must attend and will explain at a press conference her proposals for funerals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obsequies, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For a close relative's responsibilities, it's the other way around: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book La Mort en ashres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee of Ethics of the Funeral, he insists on the "violence" that constitutes cremation, for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "will accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which is due to the "exhaustion of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is readily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries, still ill-lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," said Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Approving Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to perceive it.
Approving the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with an inhumation.
Ipsos' annual survey shows a strong commitment to organizing the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"Since a decade and a half, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the delivery of ashes," said Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: hosting the assembly, naming the deceased, linking him to others, recalling him, giving meaning to his death, organizing the farewell.
This has been the case at the crematorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, since 2010, on the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of memory, both secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of people who have been creamized in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is transmitted online to those who cannot make the move.
The crematorium allowed us to relax.
In La Seyne, Relocation Because of Rats Turns to Pollemic
In the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Land Office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the head of the office.
Rats have always been in the cities.
The derailment undertaking carries out two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
We have made 64 interventions since the end of last winter.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats don't push into the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratification products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, a kid will not be killed.
"We didn't invite the rats to our home," defends the family father who left his home to settle down at the hotel.
We are soon without alcohol and expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange comes down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the decline in the dollar against yen, detrimental to export values and the warning on its annual outcome launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony dropped from more than 11% to 1 668 yen.
A house where the flames fall in the Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday noon in the Old Quebec was quickly mastered.
More than 30 firemen were dispatched to the 9th Hébert Street.
The flames appeared in a three-storey house located behind the courtyard of the Quebec Seminary.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the firemen arrived, many of which were to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it was taking a boost to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, a spokesman for firefighters in Quebec.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman : Tenth Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of Vudeville Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of the poster heads emerged in Carolines, and had a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We have created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, to which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has taken on the scale, just like the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians who participated in this year's festival went through non-traditional circuits, for example presenting shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of the fantasy football happily lascivious of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the casting of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but is still best known for her series of viral videos " Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a singular voice (the surrealist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV show on Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The appointment takes place at the Hotel de Ville, in downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would come down a alley between two buildings and say, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here.
The price of oil continues to fall and is approaching $96 per barrel
The oil price continued to decline on Friday while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the Chinese gas manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The US reference gross price for delivery in December dropped from 14 cents to $96.24 the barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents Thursday, leaving it with a decrease of 5.8% for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived Friday, showing growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to grow further after growth increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Gross Brent, a reference for the international crude already used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 the barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Remedy of Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal restored certain restrictions to the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and referring widely to the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The arrest by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice IVGs will have to have a "privilege of admission" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his or her status as a hospital-career, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
IMG defenders argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these institutions.
On Monday, a court of first instance had held on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions concerning the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is at the governor's office, asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the trial judgement that blocked the enforcement of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has successfully returned to force, side by side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% from the audience.
But was the show at the meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates presented themselves at the hearings of this 10th season, to confront the jury: Maurane, the evil Sinclair, the perforate André Manukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement to find their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored during this first prize.
Like every year, the first hearing programs are a wide selection of weed singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
On Twitter, we want to show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few found their account.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind television screens, successful singers' vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to laugh.
The Court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and search policy
On Thursday, a federal court of appeal blocked a judge's decision requiring changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed it from the file.
The United States Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the appeal filed by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed for its conclusions and remedial orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in modifying its associated policy and training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the record because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly due to a series of interviews given to the media and public statements in which it publicly reacted to the critics of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by misappropriating black men and Hispanic origin as part of their control and search program.
She appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cameras on the body in areas where most controls are carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of preserving the names and addresses of persons who were dismissed after police check.
The city's appeal hearing is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of controls registered has dramatically increased under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historic level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black men and Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
partisans recommending changes in the NYPD control and search program say that they will put an end to unfair practices, will allow for more effective and reliable police forces, and will be able to change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of pressure police forces after the police force had been severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the constitutional control and search practices, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
Renters must go to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 a month on the housing price that goes to the City for taxes.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each housing.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for fireworks at $100,000, land from $4 million to $5 million in case...
Let's vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef chef of the Elysée
Entered into the 500 m2 of the kitchens as a dome after working in embassies, the cook gravitated every stage until he became chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, through Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their holiday places, and fed an incalculable number of great people in this world in a quasi-anonymity that he breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years.
The man with open face, skull degarni and intellectual glasses, born 24 October 1953 at Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry head.
His mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I passed from one castle to another!", ironic Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manies of the six presidents for whom he has officered, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of the state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had forbidden women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
It does not displease Heads of State who showed a relative indifference to terrestrial foods, "they are all greedy," denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's no big deal that he doesn't like."
The current head of state, who returned the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, has "no demand for specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the State dinners at Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were mistakes.
The former chef of the kitchens of Elysée, who took a drink Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in his heart."François Hollande came to greet me".
He said hi.
"His human side has emerged," he says.
The chief will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been in Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of the flames in the Old Quebec Friday noon.
The building of four dwellings, located on 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three alarms from the fire service.
The fire went forward, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of fires to adjacent buildings, a big challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The house burned down was home to four houses, but no tenant was in the place at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited even though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the thieves have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
Le Loup de Wall Street: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets escape some images of his next film, whose role-title, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and take out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decoy you in his role as a loose trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "courtier in Long Island Stock Exchange, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a large corruption case on Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort climbed a ring that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascent, but also the vertiginous fall that will follow.
Without limits, man is chaining up parties, women, drugs.
Decency and excesses of any kind are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorse-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had joined them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its installation too long.
It looks like the film lasts at 2:45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in the race for oscars.
Coulson used the phone hack to check a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephonic piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bidon pipe on a link involving then running Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated in Old Bailey's court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "beautiful special adviser".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby's voice box and to "plant constantly in front of his door", but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
"The charge suggests that Mr.Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house hoping to surprise them, it's the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say," said Mr.Edis.
He stated that NotW used three ways to investigate issues: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about telephone piracy?
He says the opposite, but we say, "Of course it is."
The rumors about a link involving Clarke were first taken up by the NotW editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that they had said to her, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
One band, on which voice messages were recorded hacked on its phone at least three times, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
The investigators also found seizures on the computer of the private detective that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, said Mr. Edis.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored Ms. Pawlby's minor actions and actions.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow which I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as the former Minister of Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr.Blunkett about a connection with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to conspire with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having done telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in the throes of violence
The President of the United States was to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking U.S. assistance to combat the strongest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq experienced its most murderous month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday, 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher assessment of 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violences are increasingly deadly despite reinforced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the government of Nuri Al Maliki, dominated by Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October was highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the U.S. troops were withdrawn, the level of violence made them fear a new hug while neighbouring Syria was in danger of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are killed in the streets or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, ruling under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and of being the target of unjust arrests, has favored this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunny extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nuri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of interviews in the United States of Prime Minister Nuri Al Maliki who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At that time, the American President, elected on the promise to end the military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival Wednesday in Washington, Nuri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the Congress elected.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nuri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectoral and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded Barack Obama to make Nuri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government constitutes a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses a Uighour group of Tiananmen's attack
The Chinese Homeland Security Chief accused a group of Uighur Xinjiang separatists on Friday to be behind the attack on the trapped car that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, lit on the crowd that was on the famous square of the Chinese capital, symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office on Homeland Security issues, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkestan as the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority installed in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province the East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that are fuelled by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident in Beijing has been organized and premedied," Meng said to the Hong Kongese Phoenix TV station.
"The group that stood behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan," he added, as his words were repeated by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighour origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained gasoline filled containers and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident hurt 42.
The Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican investigates contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has begun to conduct a major survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asked the participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage.
The survey was sent to each National Bishops' Conference in mid-October, with the aim of obtaining as many responses as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family which Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesperson for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how to sound the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: The Army Attacks the Last Fifty of the Rebels · Global Voices
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred combatants, were receded at nearly 2000 metres above the farm hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fights continue despite the night," a Jomba resident told the AFP, telephoned around 12:30, saying that a girl was injured by bullet in the morning.
"The intensity of confrontations has decreased somewhat," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have repulseed the rebels a little."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "past night" in Jomba before going up front for a "ratification operation".
It was very clearly heard behind it about small arms-fed critters.
From Bunagana, a political fief and last strong place for the rebellion on Wednesday, a PPA journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source to the United Nations Stabilization Mission of the DRC, the fights entered "in a final phase", the FARDC had "encluded the residual M23 positions to delegate them".
Since Friday's resumption of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not participated directly in the fighting, but it has provided government troops with decisive support in intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were on their way to the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, border post with Uganda, aided civilian soldiers carried a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC-burning truck, to ensure the rise of another device flying the positions of the M23 on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila once again called on the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize themselves" in pain of being disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December with no result for now.
On the spot, the M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, only at Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which is rejected by Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5,000 persons had been sheltered between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the movement of return to the DRC which had begun in the morning reversed at noon.
"This morning we crossed to go into our fields, but the military told us to retreat," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including a baby on his back.
It seems that fire strikes are approaching populations.
Early in the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, English or French, the sung and danced productions take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical affirms itself as a genre of success.
Long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts would imperish the ridiculous.
And the successes like Cabaret or the Miserables carried the aureole of the mystery.
Jean-Luc Choplin's arrival at Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the gift.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like successful tubes.
The first resumes, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" could well be one of the success of the season.
On other scenes, musical performances such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of musical comedies" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for success so hard conquered.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to producers' will...
Some use beautiful pictures and a true story as in 1789, the lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year back bond on the pretext that we can serve at almost anything when we have Matt Pokora at the head of the poster.
After that, we have musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Chatelet that make us relive the Golden Age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are attempting a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "Le Baiser de la femme spiderée" or "L'Éveil du spring" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talent artists that turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
Jobs are numerous among regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-road...
The living of talent is as important as the number of positions to fill.
Why are tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often from the Boulevard theatre for adults rather than young adults.
Music shows fill that gap.
These same young people love telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of a taste of these girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely held by professionals who answer the questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
The mayonnaise is set up in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms of France in the same shape as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver in the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning about 5:30 a.m. on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, heading for Waterloo.
A driver's car was struck by a ghost driver, who is free of charge.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 at the scene of the accident, the time that the road was cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation has not caused much traffic jam because the accident took place at the time of the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child severely injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old was seriously injured following an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but he is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" attraction.
It was closed to new order.
DRC: The Army Prepares a New Assault
Children play on a carbonized armor that belonged to the rebels of the M23 in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in the eastern part of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new assault against the last strongholds of the rebels of the M23 near Bunagana, in the East of the DRC.
The objective is to remove the M23 from the hills that overlook Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by itself.
It will remain only the hill of Runyonyi.
"Chanzu's is not very strategic," the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told the AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last strong place of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23 have been receded at nearly 2,000 metres above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the neighboring town of Jumba
In Jumba, a resident who had reported fighting quite close Thursday throughout the day said that the situation was "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting of the day and were buried.
One girl was injured by bullet, and three others were injured, including a severe evacuation by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the PSA.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no record of the loss of human life.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia with respect to state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of hearing aids and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of Intelligence, again stressed in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "store the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a complainant, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether the director should believe in words.
Reports, according to which the American National Security Agency has espioned the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has access to data held by U.S. suppliers of storage services in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever caused the paranoia of companies in relation to state surveillance.
The revelation that the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vessel to overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the collaboration between US intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents German IT SMEs.
German companies believe that the United States represents a risk as important as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published by the EY board in July.
However, in all documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A Member of the German Parliament said we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company of software companies, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn't let her die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the extent and sophistication of American espionage agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations have been a shock for some companies that so far thought that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing since European officials have become aware that the data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, approximately 10% of non-American members have renounced their projects from using an American cloud storage service provider after disclosures on the American Prism Data Exploration Program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our clients are asking us today a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring subject for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the context of the current discussion," said Kurt Bock, CEO of the company producing BASF chemicals.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business leaders are generally not inclined to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, if that would leave the advantage to an adversary.
Large companies have long hammered the message that it is at least unwise to retrieve a free USB key at a professional salon or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car manufacturer's board of directors, said that the collection of mobile phones prior to council meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany's BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid while travelling abroad because of the risk of achieving smartphone integrity.
The prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access," BfV warned in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies about other countries' economic espionage activities.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, who were second-degree in committing acts of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company thought that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: "Services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, who died under unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a treadmill in the gymnasium of his high school, believe that their son was murdered, said family lawyer Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11th stuck in a supported carpet standing behind the steps of his high school gymnasium.
The investigators of the sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family contested these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's findings.
"They think that this challenges all logic, the laws of physics and common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered solely for the purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their sons to school with a poster and they were brought into a mortuary bag," he added.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they go.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I consider there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told the journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died by "positional asphyxiation".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates elements to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The office representative of the sheriff of Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to submit all video surveillance recordings that the investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents said they hoped that the video images contained clues to the circumstances of his death.
The CDC publishes guidance on children's allergies to schools
Wednesday, the American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of children of school age with severe eating allergies has risen.
One child in 20 in the United States is now suffering from food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize the teaching staff and the staff to food allergies in the child, and how to treat them in case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the self-injector of the EpiPen brand being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of States have recently updated the regulations to enable schools to have more easily spineprine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "I have the feeling that something bites my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have a beating on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total absence of debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is in public by summoning the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on his board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when the Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks in interval on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the hearings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that enables each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political and other issues worldwide, we consider that, in view of the American power, this constitutes an important lighting.
When we describe American systems of interception against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to make us unworthy of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we get rid of American collaboration?
The establishment of very powerful technology tools by the United States for ten years as a whole, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States, in particular, have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services, and, in return - it has already been said - the Americans can provide information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the substantive issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to acquire interception tools, that the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and ultimately the issue of infringements of freedoms.
What do the United States really risk, a deterioration of their image?
We've got good news of them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The American risk can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are demanding, in the light of revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American providers subject to American laws, and therefore to the NSA.
Last element: the vast movement of revelations committed by media around the world, which helps to trigger a debate on the practices of surveillance of intelligence services until now almost non-existent, could motivate legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for babies born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female of the newborn will no longer be attributed to them in a rigid manner at birth.
Under the new Act, parents will no longer be required to declare their child's sex, allowing them to enter an "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that doctors have created, concussioned and beat.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, intersexual in the group of sixty-nine diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term designating persons with atypical chromosomes or gonades (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best information available to assign it, then wait for and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a sexual identification specialist, said the new German law "seemed to be a good idea."
Intersex children have ethical dilemmas.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case with most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual appointment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
Science that consists of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very specific.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither solely that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudice-based crimes.
Young boys of non-conformity now have camps that are specially targeted to them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial that allows her to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation alongside M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from this country, which is a land Catholic, signed a petition for the “gender theory” to be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new kingdom where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, a baby's mother also said about Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of a parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And there's hardly a decade ago, the medical community regarded the kind as a slate, which can be erased and on which we can redesign.
But now, many people question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that doctors can sometimes cheat, not knowing how a child will feel about her sexual reassignment as she grows up.
"In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, they weren't calling the psychiatrist, they were calling the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr. John Money, Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He dedicated the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it to be identified as male or female.
But in a case of 1966, known as "John/John", his theories led to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a broken circumcision to have him castrated entirely, also removing the testicles, and raising him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he returned to a boy and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher stated that some doctors "always repeat this model".
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who have survived these sex change operations say "[that] they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a daughter.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
When he was 18, he was vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something wasn't going, he asked for his medical file.
What he found he horrified.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone so that his sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, he was once again a man, following a testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex persons.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director general of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Reported Choice, fears that the German law "invits labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an "indeterminate" sex," she said.
We are afraid it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that her organization supported Australia's law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal type," she added.
The German law concerns the allocation of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should carry out at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Bartz, a radiologist who specializes in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law will "responsive" parents and children.
Dr. Bartz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete insensitivity syndrome to androgens.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and intern in childhood psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or port mothers.
"The law leaves some latitude to parents so that they do not have to make early decisions," Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time frame before registering "male" or "female".
So, everything's fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
"It puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what they need," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that's a great thing.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and right in the ruling coalition near the vote of the Senate to take Silvio Berlusconi off his mandate.
In a daily interview with La Stampa, the left centre leader said he had "firmly intended" to continue ruling with his coalition until the next legislative elections of 2015.
The High Chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council sentenced for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, declares his dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October last by his refusal to give injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunshots.
Firefighters called at the scene of the drama said they had responded to a call that reported "many wounded".
"The law enforcement is on site," says the airport on its Twitter account, while TV images show people evacuated into ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesperson from the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told the PSA.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a branch, and a second one was transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9.30 p.m. in Montreal (12.30 p.m.) at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that the two and three are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights at the arrival and departure of the airport were suspended.
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli tanks shots killed a Palestinian Islamist militant from Hamas on Thursday and severely injured another one in southern Gaza, learned after sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in this region, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army has only referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and the discovery of which was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to drop Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama have considered, in the greatest secret, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most important event in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday evening that the close collaborators of the president had carried out "in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's eviction could help Obama for his re-election while his hopes were waning.
According to Times Jonathan Martin's policy correspondent, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign officials and the White House, namely the former Secretary General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the effect of replacing the Vice-President with the former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the poll.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been stoutly kept within the Chicago campaign GQ and within the Oval Bureau.
Only about half a dozen of the president's close advisers – especially Daley, Obama Jim Messina's former campaign leader and former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under study.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley carried the load to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally deciding against change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley said to the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so it was said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified the "cooperative" review, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
"The campaigns do not spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, we do not know whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if her employer was aware of the possible renewal.
Although Daley said he did not think the president "was aware" of any change, the former Secretary General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not definitely answer the question of whether political surveys had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's rejection of the presidential list was being examined.
"Perhaps," said Martin.
You want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first fluorescent jelly based on jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on the jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more it licks, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said: "It's something incredible but we're still only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about 200 pounds."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the neutral pH language.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I created because the luminescence of the jellyfish is worth four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about £ 140.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute ice cream, but I think I will find a way to do it.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a Tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the inhabitants of the town of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st Tai chi movement, with his hands of musicians that broke the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their Springs house (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're city dwellers, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living he had," she added.
Lou Reed had suffered a liver graft last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pendulum.
Over the past two years, I haven't distributed a single candy and I will certainly not do it again this year.
But the states show that I'm the gallous sheep when we talk about Halloween.
Most Americans – 158 million in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 Md in candy, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is trends.
Costumes are expected to represent $1.2 Md out of the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the inanimate sexy objects are burning.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men in Daft Punk's space will be among our Instagram pictures this year.
According to Google, the most sought after disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose it's all right to stay traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, the Americans are going to spend $330 million in animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
It's a lot of curious dogs in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't glaze.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9 million in candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kilograms of Hershey bars, shells, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a great news for the 41 million children who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we are going to buy and we are not telling stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
Maize candy is the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Manufacturers Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery that I have not yet come to elucidate.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million revenue, according to the America Haunts, and this includes these amazing photos of you stepping on your friends putting on Facebook and you can't remove and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the style "beautiful head".
Finally, let's talk about citrols.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Citrol when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped citrus tree, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – that's something we've done since we were very small.
Fortunately for us, the "baby citrouille trend" began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pots and didn't have to sit in.
This year, Americans will spend approximately $106 million on citrus fruits, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The light-screws that are slowly floating on the porch of your house were probably coming from Illinois, where 542 million citrus trees were grown this year.
If you are looking to make your point, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg citrol.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bankruptcy structure ("bad bank") consisting of 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet in the next two years and hopes that it will have completely cleaned up within three years.
RBS also said it would include a provision for depreciation of additional doubtful claims of four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonion structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thereby strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a line from the past, with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now go ahead, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the United Kingdom," said Director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has 6-point harness seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
The options include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport said: "The rally fans who join Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are very pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try out different forms of rally in the United Kingdom and international, and to prepare for the rigours and realities of raid rallies.
We have had a lot of pleasure in developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is really going to be exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after remaining stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a career
Ruby, a cocker spaghetti, had escaped after a road accident without gravity
She was identified three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the career
Firemen came down in remembrance along the cliff to recover the dog and save it from a certain death.
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firemen were called to recover him safely while he was lying 15 m above the ground on the unstable skirt of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month cocker Spaniard, escaped after an accident on the road Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a Wednesday career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked West Yorkshire's Fire and Relief Service.
They had desperately sought their lost dog and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared into the career after an accident without gravity.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with a sharp view walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the career, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton firehouse rushed to the ground and came down in a recall to save Ruby using an animal sawmill to carry it to the top of the cliff.
Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She did not move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's incredible that someone noticed the dog.
Technical Rescue Specialist Peter Lau said: " Ruby was very lucky to get rid of it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was conducted in the veterinarian for control; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified by watching the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was surprising to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had vanished, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were good-looking.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall but she didn't move."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never used Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, pop star said she was a cheerleader on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the veteran of rock and explained, "he dragged me when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he "definitely denied having made advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Perhaps she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed in the first place of the charters this week.
Beijing challenges a Turkmen Islamic Movement
"The behind-the-shelf support came from the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," said China's security body boss to a Hong Kong television station, according to a video posted on a website Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), spoke in Tachkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese official designates a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighors from the same Muslim-dominating Xinjiang region, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with fuel cans against the entry of the forbidden City to Beijing, in a suicide attack that caused two deaths and 40 injuries.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to fight for the independence of East Turkestan, formerly the Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives the Scottish people the choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Trade Area in order to join the EU.
And that's what we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along the wall of Hadrian.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper has indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it did not however appear in the large titles (and that was to be expected).
Neither has anyone said that EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when they arrange them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a minor concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to obtain from Scotland.
So this is a story that is not a story.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
However, one has forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange London's yoke against Brussels', in particular now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan for unifying Europe is definitely at death.
With the crisis of the euro, Project Europe is officially dead.
Through Europe, parties opposing the EU or militating for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency gain ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered nearly five million votes during the federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the heavy burden on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments that have excessive budgetary deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has weighed on its members the exchange rates favourable to German exporters – what German politicians want to retain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of national currency, the countries of southern Europe are faced with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in salaries and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper disease linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the 'green' energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subsidizing French and German companies in the energy sector at the cost of the consumer – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a cost-restructuring drawback, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Every wage gel in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is growing, particularly in France, one of the EU's major leaders.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy in a bad way.
As a result, the extreme right-wing party of Marine Le Pen, the Anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, bringing the socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot start from the principle that a split on the right will automatically encourage the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use the next year's European elections to create a single anti-Money and anti-European bloc within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are good at these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-Money sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like "the Europe of Nations (Sovereign)" freely preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope it will keep an eye on the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Great Britain will be left in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a small England region (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement, provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Scottish SNP government is – and it is worth noting – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Equiquiquier, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democratic coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Ageing early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
CNN Pat Etheridge's former correspondent is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair are starting to grow to 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, an endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassureing parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as the burgeoning of the breasts, the hairs under the arms and in the pubic area and the body odors, appear earlier in the girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, while it was 12 and three quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most precise test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when the development of the chest is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – something a pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinologist to remove serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the emergence of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones that can slow growth and a small size at adult age.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but recognizes that "controlling puberty can mitigate certain behavioural problems and feelings for girls to be different from others."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at the age of 10.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from the frightened school and was upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's attention on the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages transmitted by the media are responsible.
The boys, like the girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls aged 6-9 who link the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even among infants and infants.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, an endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by Brother Coen, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a fun and nostalgic film on the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that began to resonate, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography had just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinematheque, had rallied the Palm of Gold in Cannes in 1991 to Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the Peter trio, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their return on the American movie star Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the pop planetary star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs played live, Oscar Isaac turns out to be a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the movie, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious retirement.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich entourage in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less shiny clothes, a sweet voice when she sings, but the jury owed to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week's tribulation of a folk singer who can't go through and get mad at the whole earth.
He accepts standing replacements in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes a tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success was tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of mischief, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a carrier but an integral one, with self-destructive behaviour," said Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two fans of folk music built their stories on real personalities of the day like the folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this New York district called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as written by journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes the look of documentary, the label of dusty music invaded by 33T invendus inhabited by an old unpaid secretary, the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers were.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by incorporating a funny character who passes through the film permanently: a beautiful red cat with a scary look, companion of fortune from Llewyn Davis.
Questioned about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "great in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered as good", "a chance can also launch someone's career," and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise everything about his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get stuck by everything that can stop us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, author of "SAS", is dead.
He never knew the word retirement.
Phenomene of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times dedicated him to "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, theatre of 198 and 199es opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he moved on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he also went to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, nearly half a century ago.
"Surely between 120 million and 150 million all countries confused," he went on last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a Foch Avenue building just a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, the maleic eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting pirate editions," he added, drawing a stack of books on the low table between bronzes or ivores reported from the 130 arpent countries to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with a picture of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his most serene highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an aristocrat of the U.S.A. and a contractual agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, throws himself into the kits of all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 1970s and 1980s, and then jihadists from the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a zesty of violence and torture.
"I never claimed to be a literary author," Gérard de Villiers explained.
I consider myself a counter that writes to distract people I don't send a message.
He worked "like the great prewar reporters, Albert London, who went on the spot and came back with real and long investigations."
SAS' father said "make a kind of geopolitical film."
"I am always my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," adds Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, people from the services I have known for some twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitional: so, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime having killed several high officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980 he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Plot", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on the capital of Mali.
I am not a guess, I was defending Gerard de Villiers, I am simply making assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are being made.
After these trips in often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his machine writing IBM in marguerite dating from 1976 "of which all the pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords are attached to the walls of his office.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gerard de Villiers dropped these charges in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He will not die and not retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes are complaining about the width of seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute rages between the large aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-flight flights, opening the way for a bitter confrontation during the Dubai air salon that takes place this month.
The conflict focuses on the width of the proposed seats on long-run flights to passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most brokered by airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing said it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as airplanes are seeking to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-airships, possibly waiting for a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which seats will be positioned at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its refurbished "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats of more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economic class in seats of 18 inches wide configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautic giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai air salon, where 777X should take a step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were able to understand recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financials of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Will you accept this?"
"Boeing offers long-flight flights in narrower seats than in regional turbopropeller planes," said John Leahy, Commercial Director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but seats on planes have not radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined the modern long-running journey, and the turn of the century, the average American weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American size of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival clings to a concept of seat dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly baptized jet set was narrower.
Airbus adds that it ordered a study indicating that an additional inch at the seat width would improve the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures with regard to the width of seats and asserts that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that cabin experience is not dependent only on the width of seats.
"It's really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute there is a race on aircraft orders for an estimated $700 million at market price in the coming decades, sufficient to cover the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first mentioned in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what feeds the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their latest models of long-sleeved bimotors 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of origin configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this in order to be able to house more seats and make its planes more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are voting for a denser configuration, which can go with cheaper fares.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the 777 threat," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines must choose.
Air salesmen who travel around the world even take a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable appliances, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering larger side-by-side seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern appliances, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aircraft industry to set up a size standard for the end seats, but that he could forget the 777X sales wave.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on Thursday against the compensation proposal for the founder and CEO Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but comes to tarnish the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune that has just been won by the victory of his ship at the American Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had received a negative vote on his remuneration.
The Oracle boss renounced a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth goals, but earned approximately $77 million in stock-options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire fiscal year 2013, the net profit of Oracle increased by 3.5% while the course of Bond Exchange 27.5%, overperforming the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotin vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence on their lives.
Other tests are needed before testing on human beings, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College of New York stated that the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies trace all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before reaching the brain, thus preventing the smoker from having his dose of nicotine.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice subsequently given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But mice who had not been vaccinated "were calmed," said researchers, signaling that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently so that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms the liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will take no pleasure in it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and that will help them to lose their bad habits," he added.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but reported that much more extensive research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by a drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, which was carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
The previous day, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi refuses to be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the anti-corruption regulator of the state.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three assets located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (IAC) expanded its investigation to see if Mr. Obeid had pressured several government ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids had two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without a call for tenders.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr.Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of former Deputy Secretary General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressured the leases to be the subject of an invitation to tender.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay companies, which related to the Obeids approximately $2.5 million per year, were renewed without an invitation to tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tendering.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, recognized Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented at the IACC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who arrived at the Ports Department after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid in the Ministry of Fisheries.
"Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of trade lease policy?" requested Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but in any case, that wasn't it.
In any case, certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, declares a responsible
Israeli warplanes have reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening, confirming a military officer in Fox News.
The manager did not specify the target, but said there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian SA-125 manufacturing missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel carried air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The government is currently exploring the possibility of setting up a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while planning to extend the repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent visas 457 from being used to occupy unskilled positions or as a means of diverting his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government talk about foreign workers, saying he could offend the neighbours of Australia.
"The failed statements on "foreigners returning to the end of the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return at the time the trade unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historical artefact.
The working paper reports on the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are being examined.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "if the job offer is genuine in case the applicant is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring undertaking".
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seekers would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum-seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The afflicted son of the man, aged 9, went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father died Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on the island of Christmas, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services up to Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
The Minister of Baron Transport Kramer said the project would "gather the United Kingdom".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown called himself "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will cover a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 Md to £42.6 Md.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the length of travel to the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh for no more than three hours.
Baron Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it has are enormous.
Without him, we are faced with a problem of our rail network capacity.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that links between them can be improved through HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support "without a doubt" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited at the idea of working in partnership with the British government to examine options for bringing the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps."
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain for the time being in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the US gesture to ease regulation on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers examine the decision that obliges American carriers to do important work in order to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend immediately to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it examined the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of aircraft electronics," she said.
The issue is subject to regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety on a permanent basis and passengers to comply with safety requirements given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already told CASA of her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think that would improve customer experience now that we have (from the entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi) on our planes," said a spokesman.
Qantas stated that she was currently in compliance with the current rules.
"According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to American airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the decision of the FAA and the reasons for this.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing manuals, training equipment, hand baggage transportation programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will require passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely placed under seats or in upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent fight
The small commune of Pia has experienced an unusual excess fever Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about 30 people according to the evidence collected...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a row involving several people exploded on the side of the Post.
At least four slight injuries would be regrettable.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore gage lenders take advantage of the medium classes forced to tighten the belt
At the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga places a bracelet, ring and pair of gold earrings to pay for her girls' tuition fees.
"My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money has gone inside," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in some parts of South-East Asia – where household debt increases – that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, became this week the third mortgage loan company to be introduced to the Singapore stock exchange.
Paying for jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms.Amirthalinga – but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's mortgage lenders take an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fundraiser with a branch in the same commercial centre.
However, mortgage lenders have the advantage of not asking for creditworthiness verification or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to mortgage lenders while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and overindebted households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by a too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and medium-income families turn to payroll lenders to bridge the gap while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited increasing household debt, mainly resulting from higher mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest debt ratio of households/gross gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuous weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [wage scale] are looking to supplement their incomes as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have led people to hurry to collect their personal effects in order to reach the cash value of their jewels.
In Singapore, approximately 70 per cent of the items in the 200 state loan stores are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's get the chain in grandpa gold and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney’s largest retail store operator, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops over the past few months.
The increase is such in the sector of the mortgage loan that ValueMax, the shop operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops such as this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where he already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, his CEO.
The company will finance them by using 60% of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week when it was introduced to the Singapore stock exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have used the criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Miss Yeah says that wagering not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers mortgage goods they already own, and monetaryizing their personal property does not increase household debt," she said.
Guaranteeing is becoming more socially accepted as a means of obtaining short-term guaranteed funding.
Not only are people who go to the lenders on payroll not only those who have financial problems.
Singapore's easy-to-use people also go to ValueMax's loan stores to collect gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of society.
"It may be wise people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that need cash to go through a difficult direction," said Miss Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor officiated, was deeply saddened by this news.
In a press release, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released on condition.
In particular, it should not communicate with persons under the age of 18 or access to the Internet.
He will compare it in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being hunted
A man dressed in a bare Nazi uniform of a brassard with the game cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the facility that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesman from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "the time it comes, it's already gone undisturbed," she added.
I was making a tail when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were good-mouthed.
"You don't get out on the street unless you want to draw attention," said a client, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, at Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to dress up as monsters, but it was difficult to know if it was a channel.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I wear a black SS armrest twice a week at Asda for three years," said Paul Dutton, explaining that he had "mental problems."
$325M Rescue Plan for the Tasmanian Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout plan for the wavering health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the government of the state will not waste the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Pibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "emergency measures" to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The four-year funding was decided upon after government consultations with the Independent Parliamentary Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Pibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgery.
Additional 2,600 operations, including in the area of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help catch up with the delay.
Funding is also provided for unscheduled clinics in Hobart and Launcheston, better external care, training of medical managers, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat the health system in Tasmania," Pibersek said.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be formed to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for anything "unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate the public health system in Tasmania."
However, he congratulated the Government for having responded to the urgent request for help from the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing the public health system in Tasmania from the blacklist," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But the spokesman for the health opposition Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "lucky solution".
"The reason we're here is that the state Labour Government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government in the state that pulls up nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth puts $300 million, and claims it's a rough day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Pibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstitution of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
During the 1760s in France, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a Mother Superior deliberately sadistic and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never comes into lubricity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, reports the surveillance agency
Syria destroyed the equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gases, said the international chemical weapons monitoring agency on Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the northern part of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also reported on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) came with a day in advance on the deadline of the
1 November established by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "make unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and chemicals, including mustard gas and the sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapon production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights based in Britain.
The militant group, which follows the evolution of the human balance sheet through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad were killed, of which 18,678 were combatants of the pro-government forces and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and about 5 375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups of the Al-Qaïda network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory declared Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any precision.
The fights emphasized the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they must complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a lasting civil war, within a short period of time.
A statement by the OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all the critical production declared and the machinery for mixing and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the time being."
Earlier in the week, the inspectors reported that they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors indicated.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and...the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether Safira's unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the IAEA Executive Committee.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage that you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, civil war mainly opposes the Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of el-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alaouite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coast of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence imposed against one of the bombers in Bali
Survivors and close relatives of the 202 people killed in the attacks in Bali in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence against the last conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most sought after men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the bombings.
It could be released after 15 years of parole.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for the attacks on two night boxes in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of many other charges relating to terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors sought a life imprisonment sentence, yet they could have asked that the man, called "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On board the tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged to the execution squad," said Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without any other grandkids or see my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a truck parked outside, exploded just after 23 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze dropped a back bag loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He swam in the coma the next day of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he died three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
After 20 years in prison having killed 202 people and injured hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali bomb owners to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the U.S. forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Ousama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with a view to re-establishing links between South-East Asia terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't do it," added Corteen.
Until recently, he was mocking himself with the grief he could have caused to others.
The verdict was given on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be held later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year," said Corteen.
However, Patek may appeal his sentence.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not call with their mobile phone)
Air carriers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phone – under the new highly anticipated guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will take place will vary from one airline to another, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will need to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals for crew members and the rules on aircraft storage to be compliant.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," said the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them on before the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft at the plane's descent before landing and do not turn them on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, air carriers whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground running, said the FAA.
Most new line planes and other modified aircraft to enable passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Waiting, said she was happy about these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with the carriers for this – it will benefit everyone," explained Glading in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "roomkeepers" when it comes to this question.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft in aircraft mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was kicked out loudly from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the machine was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be arranged because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Onboard mobile phones will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered to be at risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government allow more use of personal electronic devices.
The heavy pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off or deliberately turn off their devices.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 as a result of the reports on interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were transporting FM radios, the high-tech gadget of time.
New line planes depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of online aircraft should allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit far lower radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who pressure to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders loaded a line plane of Kindle eBook readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to feel mixed about whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought interference from the aircraft was real, although the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to request passengers to turn off their aircraft during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed changes, calling them meaningful arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicated bird of a North Sea platform was released in nature
A bird, helicated after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
The water stream was mounted on board a helicopter heading towards Aberdeen last month before it was set up by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue centre.
The head of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This stream of water was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds at the North Sea."
The exhausted bird appears to have managed to find shelter on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to bring our help."
The water stream was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and to define what wealth and jobs creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the largest and most complete investigation with British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, who are generally representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to get involved in the long and hard process of reforming European institutional arcades.
When asked for their opinion on specific political issues – ranging from monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate compared to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40% of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European ones, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey with business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based EU relationship rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "significant change" which gives rise to power in the United Kingdom.
Issues are high – achieving a change in the treaty and better representing Britain's interests would allow 16% of votes to be dropped in favour of maintaining the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt any moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is engaged in closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, for companies, this means once again focusing on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States with Halloween colours
In the United States, President Obama did not waive the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed chillies to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, the Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the party caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" area.
Everyone is excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy, add Rhonda.
People are happy.
That's a good kid. That's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of Toussaint, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom.
"A historic event took place today: The construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, Director General of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream should allow Russia's export routes to Europe to be diversified.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is transferred to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
Pitcairn Island wishes to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking up information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last South Pacific British territory, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, with three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Mutinées of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English Navy which resulted in three Hollywood adaptations.
Some tens of inhabitants, mostly of the descendants of the Mutinés of Bounty, still live Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
An assistant to the island's mayor went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuate these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to ensure its monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia EEZ, neighbouring Pitcairn.
The FAA overrides the restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on aircraft – but it will always be prohibited to make calls on mobile phones.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice governor
A former Deputy Governor of Jilin Province, northeastern China, was sentenced to death for corruption on Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having touched more than 19 million yuan of wine pot, reports the official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, assisted companies and those responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotions for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first middle court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the chief of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "trigres" as with the "mouches" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, including former oil giant Petrochina.
The most recent case was that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having focused on the highest functions within the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two employees of the YMCA accused of sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA in New South Wales were accused of sexual assault on children following allegations against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in his opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it had "never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
The Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with offences relating to child pornography and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, a Counsellor to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by stressing that "external controls of YMCA have been carried out and have indicated that children's safety is a top priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second most adverse assessments of four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any violations of the child security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum prison term of 6 years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that would prevent staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings to children's safety.
Staff members testified that they had seen some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them in private, made them sit on his knees, told them he loved them, and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, said that she was responsible for child services at YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, which would be "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director General said he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their superior.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord clouded their judgment, which means that they did not report their actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his views before the board of the YMCA of New South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "the reporting" by the staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by the Director General of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University in front of the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledged that his return is unlikely.
In an interview the last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old man expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as a special envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to Prime Minister's position, Mr. Blair would have answered, according to London's Standard Eventing: "Yes, of course, but it might happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian events met in Cardiff to confront and win the race of the Horse of the year, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland win, a three-year-old.
Not yet in school and only a few months after having made his first weapons, the all-child and his Shetland Toffee pony trout during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparables – of the same size – were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat helmet on the side in a casual way to make his 2-year-old Pony Toffee walk around the track.
Fenton was greeted by judges for his unusual natural dress qualities for a child of his or her age.
And Toffee received very good notes for her presentation and her personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and has been training since with his Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee make a great duo."
They showed up against and against all, but both of them increased the golden cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy of joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the tracks of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air, and everybody encouraged and applauded him."
He ran the entire length of the track running and even if he seemed to be quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares about.
From the way he started, he will likely soon participate in the horse event of the year – and I am sure he will make a good performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well present and the way they walked on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud of himself.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a "will be re-elected" call
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be revised, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to television that he had accepted wine pots to make stories about a semi-public society.
The New Express is now going to undergo a "complete overhaul," said the regulator.
The order of "renewal" comes from the Guangdon Administration for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the company listed Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's writing was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "commanded the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete reboot of New Express, and recommended that he conduct a survey of those responsible at New Express and immediately restart the newspaper management team."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a first-page call for his release, writing that he was supporting his journalism.
But then Chen appeared on a public television channel where he admitted he had published false stories against money.
"In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several important suspects recently made television confessions.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make confessions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate himself.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a hurry.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of Charles-de-Gaule's two nuclear boilers, in mid-October and while the boat was at sea, was "safe for the sailors", but it was not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed us the "unavailability" of the ship until mid-November, "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DCNS company, a defence naval specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing boiler.
"Everything is being implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," says DCNS.
And the National Navy to certify that "this does not call into question the ship's activity program" to nuclear propulsion.
Recall that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier leaves an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had equipped from Toulon in mid-October for training.
In particular, in order to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "small damage", confined to the reactor's containment space, had occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great deal of dissatisfaction with the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, a flood of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to be stopped.
In short, unlimited syphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved in order to allow for a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken out of force to taxpayers decreases their consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no concern about sumptuous spending and maintenance of boitous ducks: deficit cultural center, strong grant to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, whether they are sold to or demolished by the private company.
It is also difficult to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I refer to the transformation of former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers?
It is not the public level to invest in such enterprises, but rather the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that lakes at Fisheries and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (great water users) and the large population decline, water use has declined considerably across the territory.
Without meaning to waste it, the city will never lack water and the severe regulation regarding its use could be greatly smooth.
In short, it is very easy to accomplish great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by tie with beautiful diplomas for most, and I don't think a sheep raiser gets worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4 feet by 3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzak on an equivalent length of nearly six long football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to conceal drug-charged trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out of sight, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to judicial records.
Three men, according to the authorities, who worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison for life imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, thus challenging drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways leaving the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and going up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "remission notice" against 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court had invalidated its appeal against extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow its transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuador Embassy in London on June 19, calling for political asylum for this South American country.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asked him to meet with a police station on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, having unveiled more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How Biometry Invaders Our Lives
Do you finish typing passwords to access your smartphone or pay your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
The organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this desire for biometry, but worry about it.
Only in 2011 and France, the National Commission for Computer Science and Freedoms has authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and at any time," justin Brookman, responsible for the privacy of consumers in the CDT (Centre for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in one another, and pessimism, in the other?
Biometry will be based on new techniques, which will enable new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most commonly used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, Technical Director of the Identification Field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the venous network and the hand contour, imply a voluntary and precise gesture of individuals.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data to their unawares - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
As a result, research has been carried out for some 20 years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to increased sensor accuracy and computer computing capacity required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, calculated Cyrille Bataller, Director of Accent R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today we are doing research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," said Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
Unique and infallible marker, DNA also arouses hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a voucher of €90,000 to analyse DNA samples at the place of crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometry are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (make sure that the person is the person it claims to be).
The identification has so far involved the issue of identity papers: biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) must be compared with information that the state has on all already fixed citizens.
This makes it possible to ensure that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or a store.
"We are recovering the images of surveillance cameras and comparing them to photos of celebrities who move freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, in charge of commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other use: take a picture of someone who tails in a store, follow its progression through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially involved physical access (frontier, protected premises, canteens...) or logic (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the partner who points for another," explains Cyrille Battaller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric player: this gesture replaces the secret code strike.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and brands of the large distribution: when paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Tips to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometry attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometry, a client remains in cash thirty seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, make sure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
However, due to a lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy specialists continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, made me fear the worst: a generalized surveillance," said Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
One driver running at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs was given an almond of £1,000.
A car driver was charged with a fine of £1,000 to have rolled at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At Colchester's Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from its licence led to a 6-month withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 and an overtax for a victim of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up London bubble
The Treasury provisionally accounted for the capital gains tax measure but expects a final decision of Mr. Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, recorded a 7% stamp fee for properties of more than $2 M and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold property in a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp right already applies to residential properties of the arrondissements of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 over the 2012/13 fiscal year, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook stated: "As a result of the increase in the stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on the matter, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located in southwestern London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by 11.8% in the past year.
Prices in central London show a steady year growth of 5.6% but have been eclipsed by a growing "internal market", the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to the studies of Savills.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are related to its mood.
Previous studies had revealed that happy dogs moved their tail further to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nerve dogs moved it further to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "Everyone knows that in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that just as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the movements of tails disordered by other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies in which other dogs appeared.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behaviour.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We have presented to dogs films where other dogs were in the picture – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion factor – and we have been able to trade the tail movement and present it as going more left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression stir the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog that removes the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail mainly turning to the left (again again from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think the dogs would deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience which movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet other dogs several times and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that results could enable owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their animals' emotions.
Canine behaviour expert John Bradshaw, an invited professor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, explained that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that the dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when their tail moved to the left rather than to the right, rather than to become anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study."
He indicated that differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider animals of films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, recorded in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviours can be recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert to Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock band postponed a concert to Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed to its singer.
Sheffield's group was scheduled to take place in the downtown The Hydro concert hall on Friday.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also report the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1st."
" Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets that he cannot perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – it is therefore a group of 120 "elector cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony at which bishops would be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistory.
"Pope François decided to communicate his decision to convene the consistory from February in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix catholics said that by February, the number of electoral cardinals would probably have decreased.
He stated that a pope generally appointed as many cardinals as he needed to reach 120 and as many cardinals as he wanted.
The next year's constitution will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the council of the cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to examine ways to reform the church.
Previously, the Pope decided on his own.
"From now on, François chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "very possible" that François asked for advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that François was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he will appoint."
GM reminds some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat file
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado pickups and GMC Sierra 2014 to solve a problem with manually tiltable files, according to a statement on Friday by the American vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
Consequently, records do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not protect passengers properly, thereby increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups started in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect during the first 15 October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to owners due to the 16-day halt of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
Sales of pickup Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% during the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
The GM stock course has risen by 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A dead worker buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday afternoon, in Montreal.
The drama took place around 11:00 on Marquette Street, close to the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the roundabout of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to all likelihood, work on the foundations had been carried out in this place for some time.
A mitoy foundation wall had just been built over the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools.
I walked by car and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered him.
We saw only part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a coffering company.
Revival maneuvers have been attempted by emergency services, but without success.
The man has not survived his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Labour Safety and Health Commission was dispatched to the premises to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair from an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made commendable efforts to overcome the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a painfully sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and give me hope.
His name is "The Audacity to Win" and these are the memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical reports of my patients at night and lay down, this book goes back to the time when the policies inspired millions of people and where the speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory, and newspaper presenters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period prior to his appointment in 2008, he had 82% favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really occurred in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "no seen nor known" and the murder of Usama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of the Americans, nor the prosecution of the complainants who reveal the government's wrongdoing.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the escape of public funding and the overrun of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says that the White House's efforts to reduce the media to silence are the "most aggressive... since Nixon's administration."
And more recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict previous political campaigns.
Of course, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above appear to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and poorly refined alternative that did not seem to allow him to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that had been heard for so long.
However, while the positive opinion index has plunged under 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses for Clinton at the Mayors of Pennsylvania.
At a follow-up meeting, he told his team that they needed to get on the right track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
This is five years later, Mr President, and I do not agree with you anymore.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Retinne Street in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fléron, didn't wear helmets.
Despite rapid relief intervention, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer said Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and enjoy this system.
The mining extraction magnate, which contests the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued this argument to try to rule out issues relating to a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether she obtains a leave," said Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially stated that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of a reshaping of the suffrage strip system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, France and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone doesn't agree?
Today, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered possible options for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and that he would take on his new "very serious" functions.
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of stocked dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, head of scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Milieux (OCEAMM) returns for the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Is the discovery of this new species of stocked dolphin surprising to you?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
While in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographic basis today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge of species classification science.
It is not possible, moreover, that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are challenged because of genetic progress.
Similarly, two species very close to morphologically were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
Ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific stocked dolphins and the Atlantic stocked whales.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this an important discovery as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by an accidental viral epidemic or catch occurs in the region, we could have dealt with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered by the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. stock, and the possibility of recovery from neighbouring stocks.
With regard to the species Sousa chinensis, the population of the newly discovered species, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new marine mammal species?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene broach limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than knowing what lives in the Marianne pit, just 11 kilometres from the sea surface.
We spend more money on living research on other planets than in marine research and it's a long time that it changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division on two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global regulators' investigation into the suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the most important financial market investigations in the world, where US$ 5.3 billion change hands every day.
Both traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and the other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had transmitted instant mail and messages files, sent to and from a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his post as European account manager for foreign exchange at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European accountant trading manager at Citi, was released on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged with any charges.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the folder.
UBS explained this week that she had attempted an action against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said that she was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine the allegations made about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate exchange market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicating sources close to the file.
Banks use instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
News on these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth drivers of investment banks trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market of highly liquid exchange, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms explains that it is possible to start having a low-cost impact on the market.
The news came on the same day that Credit Switzerland announced that it had sent a trader working in its London Stock Exchange fund office this week after it lost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been mastered," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been broken, supports a lawyer
After the police had confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby said she had never seen an investigation "so fucked up".
Me Ruby said he believed in La Presse Canada that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's casual friend and driver Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of extortion regarding the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police also said they had observed this man delivering packages at Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby has qualified as "inexplicable" the fact that the police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put on his phone, arguing that police chief Bill Blair has chosen to know why not act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also require an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesperson Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's words as an "evident and desperate attempt" to be argued with the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Fellowships falling to mid-term, with the exception of London
With the exception of London, the main European Fellowships are declining on Friday to mid-season, led by some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could reverse its quantitative flexibility policy earlier than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street have led to a rise in American actions, after two consecutive replication sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest replica of ACC 40, led by the warning on the outcome of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, having also published results declining this morning and announced the internal creation of a bankruptcy structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
Vodafone (+2.45%) is still in the forefront of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to press information that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the exchange market, speculations on the ECB's monetary policy are well-trained, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's unique mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the meeting next week.
We anticipate a strong potential for the decline of the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to decline against the U.S. currency and has touched a lower session than two weeks to $1.3517.
These same conjectures support the euro area's compulsory market on the other hand.
The Supreme Court validates Obama's health system reform law
Big victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today stated that the law on reforming the health system ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to sign health insurance by 2014, on condition that they pay a fine – and declared that it was constitutional under the government's tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Law of 2,700 pages and considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that Medicaid's eligibility threshold should be lowered if all federal funding of the program is lost, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The proceedings to block the law were initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates for the presidential election in high school during the 2012 primarys, including the so-called Mitt Romney candidate, strongly opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to the veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and the dead of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MP Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Acrochage between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured Thursday, 31 October 2013, at night during a violent hanging on the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, 1 November, following the depletion of its fuel stocks, announced the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another frame of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by tank shells during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younès, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of about 100 metres into the territory before leaving.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a press release, a Hamas spokesperson, Sami Abu Zuhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found their death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates Al-Qassam's heroes who fell to defend the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupant in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell of an occupant," threatened the spokesperson.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and, according to the army, destined for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, stating that the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device aimed at the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said the spokesman for the army Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck an air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles for the Lebanese Shiite Movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday, October 31, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not provide any details on the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he just added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Quoting "exclusive sources" that she did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain stated that "the bombing aimed at a shipment of ground-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that fights the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn in an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Dance Dance his two new group choreographies: the first inspired by Henry Michaux's inks and poems, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopedias of Satie.
A evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advance, profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the entire piece: an indelible array of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only their hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next graph appears, incarnate, emerge in current.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solo relays, in group with unison (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Glory of the Morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed online at the front stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance rug, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a portion of the poem of Michaux, monocord and monotone in the scream, and continue dancing.
And the music of leaving, and the sequence of taking back.
This loud and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up sweating and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard's - like these hairs that get boisterous or these black tissues that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It seems that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, imposed himself with his tics.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
The inks of Michaux, like the shapes of Gestalt, open a broader and more gibocious imagination than dancing, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers hit by stroboscope light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the intrusion, are richer.
The scene is partly gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers were relaying to play the scores.
Their rude music, touching, give real fragility.
On stage, they pass couples, in lovers duo, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Clowns appear, also familiar to Chouinard, nestling in the red nose, in very polarized romantic male-female parades.
Loves are butchers, fugitives or players.
The gesture, laughter and small screams beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of the bodies in coitus, of the beings that merge.
But the room takes its real fly after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the public leaves.
There, everything becomes permitted: the fourth tomb, the explored universes overlap, the cabotin dancers, descend among the spectators, gloating, smoking, circling, playing codes of applause, stretching the sauce in a scientifically calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness are sweating, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are the subject of judicial proceedings concerning Northern patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nordol patents has started an avalanche of patent prosecutions on Thursday against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company that he co-signed to the pole during the sale of patent auctions that took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired North patents for $4.5 Md, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent infringement companies before the United States Court of Appeal in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly held by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow for advertising in relation to Internet search terms, have indicated the findings of the trial, which is Google's core trade.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture telephones that work under Google's Android operating system, which provides fierce competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering 4.4 Md$.
After losing the Nordal patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 Md, a partial market based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although having failed in his attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continued to violate those patents," said the findings of the trial.
Rockstar claims more damages and interests against Google because it claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a home in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a defective water heater, indicated Friday night the replacement of the King's attorney.
The expert posted on-site by the public prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
Grandma turned on a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The life-threatening prediction of the two victims is still under way.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and was severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and companion, was at his side and was burned slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on site before being taken to the CHU of Liège, she was in a helicopter, in an ambulance," said the bursar José Paulet, who went down to the premises.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairway remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
Firefighters from Andenne and Namur and the Arches Police intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnée has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt calls on the first freely elected president to take an oath
Mohamed Morsi lent the investment oath, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he lent the oath of investment to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding in Hosni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took an oath before the 18 judges in black dress of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and hard-repressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to acclamation the new President and, taking note of the presidential façade of the Mubarak years, the circulation was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy to the very frequent streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic "help wheel" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has greatly strengthened since his victory and his speech on Friday during which he tried to appear not only as the candidate of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun at the 2011 uprising against the authority of President Moubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue costume and red tie, addressing the judges present in the room adorned with woodwork where he swore.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he gave his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was in custody.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." surrounded by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and the former foundation of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday's Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended the Mubarak authoritarian regime came to an end last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former defeated president, had possessed him.
But by agreeing to give an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the USA has curbed the rise in the car market
The 16-day closure of most federal governments weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published by the manufacturers on Friday, five of the six main performances below expectations.
The three major manufacturers of Detroit show two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
The analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted rhythm sales, but the market stood at 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst by Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he felt that this slight brake was primarily explained by the government's "shutdown" and its impact on the consumer's feelings during the first 15 months of the month.
However, GM reported an increase of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared with 211 563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands saw their commercial performance improving compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit, among others, from the success of its pick-up, saw its sales progress from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was waiting for 194,301.
On the other hand, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared with 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also have lower sales than consensus, despite increases over a year of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM won 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford gave 1.1%.
Renault led in the Stock Exchange by Nissan's warning
Renault accuses Friday the biggest decrease in the SBF 120 index in Paris after his partner Nissan Motor announced that he had reduced his annual net profit forecast by almost 20%, reported traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a review, also announced a renewal of his leadership.
Several traders reported that Renault's action was affected this morning by "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning," said a manager of the trading of a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese builder 15% of French according to Nissan's website data.
Greece: two dead in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party site
Two people were killed and another was severely injured Friday night by fires fired by two people who were on a motorcycle passing in front of a location of the neo-Nazi Aube gold party in the western suburbs of Athens, a police source was learned.
The police were not in a position to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Aube doré had claimed that the victims were guards at their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized according to the same source.
Police officers from the counter-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of suburb Néo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident took place a few weeks after the indictment of six deputies of Golden Aube, including the party's leader and founder, for participation in a "criminal organization" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his dismissed call and will be well suspended for the next two league matches of his club champions, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barça for having shot at Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a press release, his club called himself "very disappointed", claiming that his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in black, Montérégie with 13,464 and Outaouais with 8642.
The large Montreal region also knows its lot of panels with nearly 7,000 private homes of electricity in the metropolis and in Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its forecast of net profit up and hopes record results through the Australian and UK vacationers.
The travel agency is now expected to achieve a underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million before tax, against a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12-17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had made 8% profits in the first half and that the second half had started in force, particularly with regard to travel other than business trips to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are well on track to achieve record results for the entire year before interest and tax deductions," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the biggest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector increased during the second half of the year, making it possible to compensate for a small decline in domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, the Flight Centre's leisure travel sector has achieved good results while business customers have spent less.
Her subsidiary in the United States recovered her losses during the first half of the year where the seasonal demand is lower and should benefit over the year as a whole for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre actions increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown draw on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Caught strangers opened the fire this Friday at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making any victims, as a result of an apparent quarrel with redundancy workers.
Assailants fled, the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, General Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt receives almost no more tourists since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi early in July and represses the demonstrations of its supporters in the blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to today.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass an independent-language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamentals next year.
On the other hand, Ofqual, the Regulatory Review Office, will unveil a reshape of the structure of the CCSEs, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our system of reviews to restore public confidence," stressing that the CSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
By comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore spend approximately 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GSCE of in-depth maths – as well as the greater importance of the material in international classifications – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of course.
The programme will focus more on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and referring widely to the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a gun in the Very for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were door - to - door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the riparians of the Very neighborhood visited by the children opened the door by holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, 86, explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The former chief of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, said the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he assured the daily high-tempered by relying on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the post-War.
The German secret services, the BND, provided as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were totally wrong.
"Since August 1945, Müller's body was found in a provisional tomb near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," said Mr.Tuchel.
He was wearing a general uniform.
"In the left inner pocket were in particular its service states with a picture," he continued.
Bild also issued a document from the district of Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is a huge taste.
"The memory of the victims is greatly crowded from the foot," he insurgented in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is among the important figures of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and was, in particular, led by Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to choose him "Heros CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alter the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the sequel to the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in bonded clinics and hospitals to get any treatment he could benefit from.
"It's not easy," said Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock, crash at the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are realized in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed more than 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And it created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas during weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they start in vans after they set medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrains to get to the villages that most need help.
Chance doesn't always follow them.
They had to push vehicles repeatedly to cross muddy rivers or trails.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his great smile and overwhelming energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team started receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive cramps, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthetic.
The operations are usually performed in a school, a mayor's office or a house; after the intervention, the patient wakes up and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
This is an exciting rhythm, but the musicians of the villages generally help the team remain motivated.
"They hit drums all night long to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," explained Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returned to town, tired but proud of the work she did.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 free surgeries last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those who come to help him.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical firms around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to carry out these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr Bwelle in his missions, it is an opportunity to learn in the field they don't have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help lay blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwell," said Miss O'Malley.
This is not something you have an opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He is a hero, there is no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a challenge.
Helping others to live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Laughing people and alleviating pain are the reasons that move me to do so.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Inquisitions, academics have long painted and located Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but by highlighting its weak for the paths of crossing, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrator of others' works in his office at Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but by ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair occupied by Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Of course, but knowing that such a sacred thing cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the the thesis, of which it has passed.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakening, animator and a federation of their work, but noting that he was unwilling to produce it himself.
To this image uncertainly the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
Bad languages were able to see there a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a sharp glance and erudition, but uncurably amateur.
The two books published by Nora in the near future two years have already established that the one who passed by for not writing had a lot and well written.
The book here should ultimately render justice to him.
There is, however, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagabondity, retirement to jump as a joint foot from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the brocator back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of French identity.
Why do these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It's a matter of time.
Little by little, we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at the time, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliged, was entrusted to authorized prefects and sub-prefects, interpreters.
What Pierre Nora does is everything else.
He does not inherit eternal frankness, he refuses to define himself.
Concerned analyst of family strangeness, he wanders into a forest of symbols, arrested at each step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented with irritating questions.
Of which, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so sustainablely settled in its borders, if formerly framed and solidly masonry, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, only to conjure up the disorder born of disagreements in French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the divisional forces here are very old.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that splits national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without having succeeded in denying it; rather concerned about regaining its sacredness and all the more craving for unity and indivisibility that it had cut off its head to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, a nation invinciblely binary, shared between the left and the right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this unique French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escapade could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But the American sewerage only makes us more aware of what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no more to worry about.
Here, men covered with an Old Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and trusted it.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make, and who have been among themselves.
There is an institutional constancy, and here is a cascade of constitutions, as many errors to catch and try again.
France leaving, France coming
However, there was a time when the French believed they could wear the torn dress of their history, and beat the curse of figure two.
In this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, by teaching schoolchildren everything that in the old France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity only had time.
This is again under discussion, surrounded by immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of claimed minorities, absorbed in European space.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France that leaves and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With, first, the portrait of the historian, which should reserve a few surprises.
We found out that the fireplace was a housekeeper.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The smoother was held at the center of the centre.
And the one who had deposited, here over a half century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had abstained from the initiative exercise of the the thesis, entrusts us, with salted grain, that he would have done it.
Certain in a less rigid, more exploding and more subtle form.
But let's not cheat on it, just as binding.
For much more than the figure imposed by the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
The journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on November 27, 1987, with three members of his "Antenne 2" team filming a Hezbollah event in Beirut on March 8, 1986.
Retired since 2008, he participated in the creation of the hostages hostages association "Otage du monde", which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to file complaints and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Detained over 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital Wednesday afternoon, they have been able to find their families since then.
And gradually try to resume the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former major reporter, retired since 2008, president of the "Otage of the World" association.
From the night of your release, you were on the 20th hour of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me that we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They're putting us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive on the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
French people take us to the French Embassy.
It's time for the first calls to the parents, the family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night talking to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate ourselves to the airport of Larnaca in Cyprus.
Upon arriving in a helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua is boarding.
How did your arrival on the French soil take place?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a bit brutal.
There's an incredible compass.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'll be right back, and there's plenty.
The descent of the plane's staircase, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and me, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull their asses to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent some of them from going up.
Media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to manage.
But we made it harder.
The same night, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very gently, for a month or two that are a bit like vacation.
How did the medical examinations and the debriefing DGSE go?
I was entitled to a first medical checkup in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Gràce the following days I returned: radios, exams in all kinds and meet with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know we can count on it, remember it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostage takers.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what he says.
The debate on ransoms, in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I am trying to share things between the questions about my past as hostage and my headphone as president of the "Otage of the World" association that allows me to distance myself, and I find it much more interesting to approach.
For example, I would like to ask myself about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, along with others, for the recognition of the legal status of hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
The taking of hostages for "political" hostages, which is the case for most of the time, must be described as allowing hostages to have access to justice, to complain and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that such hostages might have access to justice as well?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why would it not be said to hostage takers "you have violated the rules of war, such as those of all the Geneva conventions, that you will be brought to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be grounded, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but it doesn't listen, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
The anger rages in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of President Mohamed Morsi opened, they went down the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to call for the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
It is not a trial that this Muslim Brotherhood activist emphasizes.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial of pro-Morsi, he is supposed to have Sisi tried, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Confrontations broke out in Alexandria, and the police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel reproaches 9 U.S. States for violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state has recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to an identity card from the Department of Defence and to the benefits that come with it," the Minister in New York recalled in an address before the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the facilities of the National Guard," he denounced, accusing those States of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these maps, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access to their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said he ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nuance of the nine states began by Texas that refused to implement these benefits on the settlements of the Texan National Guard because of a conflict between the Texan Act and the Federal Law on Homosexual Marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the Reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, November 2, at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration is taken on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and qualifying phases will begin at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the award at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young Jewish prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for the European championships in Copenhagen and he does not like anything until he shows it to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
Toronto's Mayor hunts journalists to interrogate him on a drug case
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugs, according to several media outlets.
A video sent to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, always denied having used crack, while recognizing having a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he drove several journalists from his property to interrogate him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A rabies case detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday, October 31, that an angry case had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin while France had been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The rabies diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological survey was initiated to identify and assist people who could have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October inclusive," said the ministries of health and agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human rage, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the symptoms appear, is very effective," says the communiqué.
The ministries now call on persons who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucosa or skin injured by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since 2001 France has been free from rage, this kitten or the mother has been imported from another country, which is not free", according to the communiqué.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "autochtone" case of identified rabies dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE)".
One case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," the ministries recall, and it is transmitted for nearly 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama moves backwards on his health system reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his unequivocal promise and often repeated that "if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people have received notice of termination from their suppliers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with adequate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "an effervescence in the news" about the terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better adapted health plans for the same price, even for even less expensive than expected.
"You will win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the self-insurance population were forced to change their regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "sorry".
"I am as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I look forward to returning your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, while she believed her micro cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly meeting yesterday following a controversial exchange of views with Billy Long, Republican representative of Missouri, to determine whether she should join Obamaare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long repeatedly asked Ms.Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel features a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy elected, Jake Vite Prekop, has combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the level of the track.
German Sebastian Vettel, quadrupled Formula 1 World Champion, sneezed for the free essays of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Friday a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose out of 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automobile brand, of its stable.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday to the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet for the race on Sunday to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his suburban Party
Let's not cheat especially.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, it justifies it.
When I speak of suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It does not prevent its project, presented Thursday at a press conference in its native town of Aubervilliers, from being born of a desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural pot mix that characterizes above all the neighbourhoods.
My proposal 1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, it says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territorially attached, claims today as "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the equality values I advocate in my program are attached to the left but if the people on the right are ready to support me, I will listen to them, too, he continues.
There are only extremist parties I don't talk about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its programme - consultable on the Internet - from many topics supposed to speak to the inhabitants of suburban areas and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civilian majority at the age of 16, the rehabilitation of the office of custodian of real estate...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the municipal elections of 2014, this could be just, he acknowledges."
It's a matter of time and money.
The suburban Party should still be represented at Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune already has seven list heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I've received since yesterday do not all emanate from suburbs" he was delighted.
John Kerry admitted, made unprecedented, that American espionage "was far too far inappropriate"
John Kerry pointed out that the United States' defensive attitude towards its monitoring programmes had been reduced by admitting, without a precedent, that on several occasions, espionage "was too far off inappropriately".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, as well as Barack Obama, had ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by denunciator Edward Snowden on NSA espionage activities emerged.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other government members have become aware of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had exceeded the thresholds, but he insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force acting for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, make them explode and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they do?
We have prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will visit Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged American espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, said the Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had expressed himself to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had posed regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorism organizations because of the feeling of frustration that comes from monitoring the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in their mutual commitment to combating terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first mandate, and president of the US Senate's subcommittee of European Affairs, during an interview from Washington.
And I am going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has hampered relations with certain U.S. allies, but the Agency's director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it involved metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents issued by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the espionage of the allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show "affective firmness".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they have been applying themselves for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect European rights, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do espionage," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to visit this weekend in the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, led by Shell's bad results and after an announcement by the Fed of maintaining its support for the economy, as planned.
One Australian uses his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely alleged assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed for trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Province Court on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her earlier on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket's police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the history of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local police station cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15-day imprisonment in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
He is the daughter of the former player of the Australian rugby League Peter Tunks, who called on the Canberra Ministry of Foreign Affairs to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We have of course experienced a distressing moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed for judgment and was released after a 50 000 baht bail.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region in southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources reported that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an abated sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Michelle Smith's Phuket, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to recycle its damaged image with tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
The French police will stop Anderlecht's supporters coming other than with the RSCA's cars
The French police have decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain set Tuesday, communicated Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson of the Brussels-Mirday police zone, Friday.
The Belgian carriers of the RSCA who wish to visit this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the displacement system established by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former border post in Rekem to the PSG stadium," the spokesperson transmitted.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture reported that measures have been taken to arrest or even guards in sight," announced Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated, a year ago, consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to think about how to better integrate students who live on horseback among different cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The Organization Vision diversity has been in schools for a year to help students from all backgrounds discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our sites are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of stock or they have come from.
Who are our builders?
"So, we create projects so that they identify with all this," explains vision president Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the New World Institute, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, support for staff in the transformations we see within the student clientele," he said.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has set up a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who also sometimes come from.
Rachida Azdouz of the University of Montreal will be the Scientific Director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Different educational strategies, that's the real need," she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: language, school, social and cultural.
