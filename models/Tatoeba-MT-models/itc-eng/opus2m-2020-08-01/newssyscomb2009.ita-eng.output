The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have led, according to the first interim results, to the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), in which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously wavering, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the sub-prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return to national policy.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the Socio-Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes compared to the last 2006 elections, however, it loses 5.5%.
Even worse went to ÖVP, which loses with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian history of the post-war period and above all the literally catastrophic result of the people, who have led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the populace had a significant advantage in favour of SPÖ.
But the voters evidently punished them because they caused the government to sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignations of the party president, Vice-Chancelleur Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it might already happen on Monday during the extraordinary convening of the party's leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely exit from the electoral result, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition .
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) gained 18% in advance and BZÖ 11% in votes - but the socio-democratics at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999 when the populists agreed with the people to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 separated from the BZÖ) which was even the cause of sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution clearly plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national policy.
The Green Party has also been able to enter Parliament, but it has fallen slightly, falling between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India Can Cool
If the problem could not be solved by Czech scientists who were accused of illegal collection of beetles in India, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it did not resolve, then it would be a certain cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly interfere with legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the Minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison to resort to a higher instance.
Then you can ask for bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the Court of First Instance, then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter the matter is to give the convicted the "competent legal support", the Indian Minister supported.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been with India for many years.
Also admitted by the Indians," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, in front of his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider a deep mistake the imprisonment and the accusation of these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question if he has obtained a promise from the Indian side to deal with it.
"I've got relatively many promises," he just said.
A Czech judge in the battle for seabeds
Approaches to the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are designed.
But he is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers on ocean and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and occasionally adds something.
Dominate the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a world little known rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also living organisms known until now that bring within themselves the key to the discovery of medicine against cancer.
The largest ground floor of the mainland
Coastal states have begun to take an interest in the underwater territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they are promulgating laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental platform, which often extends to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, it has an exclusive right on all resources of the continental shelf.
"In a few words by continental platform is that part of seabed and its subsoil that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often more than 200 nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The country's request before the continental platform's size-definition committee must be accompanied by very broad technical-scientific documentation based on many investigations and costly measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The committee has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia’s recent success, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has recorded a global echo.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to you by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers therefore about six times as large as the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bear them in the future from the seabeds, as they promise will be invaluable.
Other states too will gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
At the end of the continental platform begins the area of the bottom of the ocean which the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity."
No one has been in an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Founder is not Klondike," says former director Mikulka, "with the fact that his individual parties are legally demarcated and their regime established contractually."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If he shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
This was acquired in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the extended Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken, this is a nearly underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is a stock of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker in the Division of Macedonia Rober Sandev brings with him a repertoire to show him.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, a legendary scheme, like in the legend of the Golem awakening.
German special units were present at the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in the liberation of the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is available on the circumstances of the liberation of the 11 European hostages seized.
On the rescue operation as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, special German units participated.
In addition to the military specialists, GSG9 units, the Avian Federal Police, the federal criminal office, as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present.
As the spokesman for the ministries announced on Monday night, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join them as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get lucky," says a spokesman for the interior ministry.
Aggressors kidnapped on September 19 in southern Egypt a group of travelers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
The freed in the meantime arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages released are under the protection of the German embassy.
It has not been explained on the release details.
There was no information in Berlin, for when they would be back in Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units should fly with an Airbus of the military aeronautics and arrive Tuesday in Germany.
American House of Representation rejects the rescue package.
The first room of the American Congress has just failed the 700 billion dollar rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 items around 227 the US representative house rejected the government rescue package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals made by American President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, there had been no majority for the programme, with which the chaos of financial markets should have been tackled.
In a dramatic action the supporters desperately tried to persuade critics from the heavy 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, encouraged Members to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something that has not yet arrived..
While the suffrage was in progress, the Dow Jones collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investor concerns was that the state rescue package could have failed.
It is resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, it will collapse again.
Experts are now expecting other serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it must have the benefit of both the House of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of bookings
It seems to be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study, the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak views of conjuncture, the desire to travel Germans under an investigation remains firm.
On bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31 % surplus of turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German tourism association DRV announced in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the market search institute GfK there are increased booking rates even for the autumn months.
Therefore, the excess of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would amount to about 11%, the DRV reported.
Assume for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
It would also include travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the low dollar quote, in particular would be travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly requested travel destinations in Germany, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as in Germany.
Above all the travels all included have a high quote, explained DRV president Klaus Laepple.
Considering the increasing costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, booking discounts made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the previous year there would again be an excess of the turnover - although according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time in Oktoberfest
Ballermann's hits, one litre mouth beer and vip in Dirndln graffiti.
A Wiesn debut
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second-hand.
One thing, though: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, photographers are already throwing themselves at us and taking pictures to fill the memory of the camera – very luxurious, and this at my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how friends do it.
The two-money Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually resident in the north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/clothe so far remains within limits.
And instead, once you've arrived at Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's ankle collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A monk points out that I would have tied the ankle in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, at the center six virgins, on the right you are busy, behind the widow."
I'm suddenly fixing my bow from behind to left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of thin flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which head "To drunk to get dressed!" and pull the back naked against an uninvited one.
The boy with performance inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a torn "oooooo".
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mouth from a litre before.
Right next to one of these moisturizers, of which everyone thinks it's a skating.
Bob, I mean, he's one of those famous Wildbieslers.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 p.m., people walk in white in the square of the feast, who must take care of the poor beons
Nurses always appear in white – always 4 at a time drag a barrel covered in tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: you go empty, you come back full.
Who lies under the curtain in this blood-alcoholic bar, can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," screams one of the toilets and disappears in the baronda.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but she died shortly afterwards.
After the accident a 51-year-old man was arrested with the mistrust of driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most beautiful remains of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neo-renaissance style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building is riding between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking to the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building slightly decadent.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling around, there's no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway running in Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the ice-cold borders of the cold war, has passed
British and dominant forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 an ammunition train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then he has slowly gone out of the way, far out of history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-largest diplomatic horizons.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created an entire new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
The Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the wagon bed for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish deputy Suat Kinikioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a stunning race along the tracks that produced the ancient world falls of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a century-old intended to turn his back on his Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic root represents an exemplary movement in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by commercial centers built and power bakeries, where business managers - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a central-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The cold war was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its territory.
Today you must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't one's case.
They must be both.
"But surely at a certain point, "I ask, "Will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost all those I spoke to here have recited in memory: the ties of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as much as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically travel those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha Station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentleman Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to see that Europe's Middle East ambitions can now be largely in Turkey's hands.
And as I stand at the terminal for the ferry that brings me back through the Bosforum, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At that time, there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent it should advance its claim on this fascinating country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11th) had in charge of Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21, but at the time the Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changeable) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to face all that the music presented to do, both Madrid and Messiaen, without accompanying or with the entire orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let music be to speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial nor flowered.
Whatever the musical standard was, it made it more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint an orchestra director, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he led Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and over I've dealt with more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I've never disagreed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply "carried around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25th) specifies that "in 1946 he began studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... at the same time studying for a degree in science, one in letters and one PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, at that time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vita", because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, although treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda Supersolds
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new volume has an even wider internal space.
A refined mechanic should be added to everything, which increases the driving comfort and enables fuel to be saved.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Jazz Wave.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth reporting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before passing on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after its entry into the first generation market.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other producers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case with Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan alone, almost a million units of Jazz have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation is concerned, the heads of the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda .to reduce sales to good measure in Spain.
In fact, the managers of the company plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, i.e. 4,000 less than in 2007, with a 16% decrease.
Despite the increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, Honda trusts the arrival of another model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the company's presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz grew in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the interest is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in size, the living space also extends.
This advantage stems from the inclusion of a new platform, and from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with double background – rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of engine version 1.4, and that the baggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, are opened with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, motors in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with petrol engine of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to use a power of 90 cv to 6,000 laps with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. to 4,900 laps.
The propulsion – which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, they are now available 100.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reaches a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "ape car" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, for example, takes the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Centre have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Two, Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, BR23C constitutes an extension of the Safety Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer's house.
During the flight, each water creates its own oval-shaped personal space which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the bees' compound eyes, able to see in all directions with an angle above 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, engineers have developed what they have defined as a localization laser(Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately allows you to prevent the collision.
"At the moment that it detects an obstacle, the small robot imitates the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction turning on the wheels at right angle or greater to avoid the collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and engineer head of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot turn upwards or downwards, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which they can rotate its wheels and not exploit infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, nor about mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be serial in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to destination by avoiding obstacles in the path.
Tremble before borrowing
We must recognise that the United States Treasury Department, as well as having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from committing themselves with money laundering in dubious banks, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Bad Credit Hotel" or problems.
The fourth aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce thinking not one, but two or even three times before requesting a loan.
And, above all, where to do this, which is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for the wide audience.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, it looks like a sound room inside the hotel.
It's still something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest $9 billion in a share of 21% of participation in the Company, news received as a result of a net drop in its shares in the Stock Exchange.
One week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The fixed price shall be less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the overall transaction would take place on the basis of an average price of $29, or a percentage below its current course of 28%.
By 17:00, however, Morgan Stanley had fallen from 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," explained John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her actions by however passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than the one taken earlier.
Monday's modalities also show that in the last days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained: "We thought our share of participation would be exclusively composed of ordinary actions.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, over a given period, the latter will be traded more than 50% below the conversion price fixed, or about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow her to take investment opportunities, strengthen her budget and increase her liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency coefficient of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has specified that she has "clearly" lightened her budget since the end of August.
The last few weeks have tested the group, which has seen half the value of its actions while the cost of the risk insurance has been immunized.
However, it was still at a high level on Monday, around 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivored" among Wall Street's large investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's detection, announced that he earned $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffettt group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Founding the republic on socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the project of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, based on 80% votes.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the election seats and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a crashing victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
"The Constitution triumphed gloriously," he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The ballot, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points aimed at consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrines the state's power over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives more power to the Head of State, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to propose its candidacy for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states that health and education services are free of charge, which the President has begun to promote in this country 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commander launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held prisoners in the desert for ten days were brought back on Monday afternoon, healthy and safe, to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Chad by an Egyptian commander.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base, near Cairo's international airport, about 15 and 30, on board a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to release any interviews to the press, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential outskirts of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and have not been paid any ransom "to the kidnappers," said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garana on the runway.
Accompanied on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been shaken from one hiding to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Egyptus, the organization agency of the safari.
One Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night shortly before dawn.
"There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others escaped," said the manager who demanded to maintain anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commanders.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of the secret agents and the Italian special forces.
We must admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were found and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and caught two of them.
According to the army the kidnappers would be linked to an organization of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a statement immediately denied by the latter.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the front page, a debate on the financing of culture focused on the current election campaign.
So much better.
But part of our cultural life remains in the shadow.
Who will pronounce to denounce the poor money granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or to the national historical places that starve?
Which policy will dare to remind the federal government that is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the only restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
It is the Constitution, in our neighbours, that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped in 211 companies for the preservation of historical, family heritage, archives and heritage goods, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is them who often defend our heritage, protesting with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states assist the Belgian-Dutch Fortis bank through partial nationalisation, which has been in difficulty in Europe for the first time because of the crisis in the US credit market: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands at the weekend agreed at the highest level, also involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been discussed for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions made in this area can be a precedent.
According to the decision taken Sunday night all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of the Fortis had started with a vertical collapse, serious signs of the institute's crisis had then appeared in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow them to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares on Friday fell by almost 12%, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Given the current share prices, the group's entire capital value is around 14 billion euros, but according to bank managers this value is not real.
The company summit places the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US plan of 700 billion dollars.
Monday the title slowly resumed to rise.
Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new managing director of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented himself with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors should not be afraid of losing money.
Among the bank customers there was no panic, the subsidiaries were not assaulted.
In Hungary the Fortis owns autonomous branches and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurers, on the basis of people's medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken to the fox" - writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies shall pay the insurance rate and the amount payable in the event of losses to the health status of any customer and if they consider the risk too high do not conclude the insurance.
Some time ago, the client had to undergo a medical visit and the contract was concluded only after the exam was completed.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer identification code you can easily get information from the pharmacy on which medicine he bought in the last year and half and from this the evidence program of which diseases he suffers and under what health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly purchase large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the fat level in the blood is in practice unguarantably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
There are several versions of the programme on the market, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer does not remain much in addition to paper work, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the opposite are that some medicines are usable for more purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraine or heat pumps, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance point of view - commercial, is worth increasing risk factor, the first two nos.
For the request and processing of data, companies were formed separately and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacy, require the approval of the patient.
The authorities are now forcing them to do so even though they have not imposed fines for negligence so far.
Some firms have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to the data on drug use in order to provide a more accurate picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data and parallel control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress, there is a bill that gives the authorities control competence to specialized data-servicing companies.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that connects the other data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot deny approval so much because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So at the end the hens are entrusted to the mercy of the fox.
Global Martial Menu
European Union and India doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade mainly among themselves, the agenda for the ninth meeting at the summit has been dominated by this subject, as well as all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will first treat cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Committee and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in five years, i.e. to increase up to EUR 100 billion, trade.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious a goal.
As a result, 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have legally unified, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only 9th place among EU partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Trade Doha Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the energy and climate programme, that is, it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to conclude a global pact at the climate conference scheduled for next year and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister today will be in the French capital where, in a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris it is hoped that in order to build Indian nuclear reactors, French firms will receive a commission worth EUR 20 billion.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt.
Over three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The International Fair of the Frankfurt Book awaits this edition over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
She will be the Secretary of the Ministry for Goods and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be present institutionally with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will follow the meeting with the press at Room Struktur in Buchmesse's room 5.0: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author books is gradually reduced over the total of Italian production, especially for adults and young people.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire disappeared a year ago
The remnant of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 as he flew into the Nevada desert.
The routes were found on an altitude of 3,000 metres above ground, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, escaped the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fosset was flying on the day he disappeared" said in a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains have been found either in the aircraft or in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63, was given to die in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the sighting of the wreck was sent a team of investigators, who then identified the equipment: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, scattered from 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett had been found by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash money and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, in the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic ball: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had been around the world by plane and without stairs.
Among its many records, including that of flying at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the patterns with an original design and well defined by fixed lines, large surfaces and net corners.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the "compact" offroads of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a fresh start in this area.
Just for its contents outside the traditional canons, it will be unexpected and unconventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showroom next October 17.
Thus the advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through an avenient campaign of 3D auctions, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-affisions, articulated in three different phases, will dominate the very central Milan shopping route, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first stage of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como you will be able to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, by looking at the image you will have the impression that the car gets out of the manifesto.
Later, through the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, then recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped field of motor communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to sharpen the interest of future buyers? We will see.
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following for years the Blue National and that so far, for the truth, has never created too many problems.
He wasn't even opposed to opposing typhosis.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added grouppuscoli (little units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the cities of militant origin appear: Saturday evening they were removed to be unidentified.
They're inspired by English typhos.
In Bulgaria, they found a true Nazi styphossery, that of Levski.
Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all names, therefore easily controlled.
And the Viminal had checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with an ongoing Daspo, no one who had been inhibited by attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had previous stage crimes, had in fact been refused the ticket and prevented the transfer.
The Viminal now expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and then take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to who has been identified in the disorder.
An international Daspo that prevents attending not only the Italian stadiums but of all Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, they're not gonna set foot in a stadium anymore.
Luckily.
But now there is fear-emulation: that is, that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others add.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say by the Viminal.
So, "look carefully open especially in view of the National match on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia there is a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is secret services, which deals with the very problems of stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm stretched during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it's not a crime..."
This was the thought of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks' director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the place that was before Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazelli was previously the one of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to deny the Duke but surely the behavior of those 150-200 typhoons has been shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - he adds the No.1 of the Observatory - the offences must be attributed in the country where the fact happens.
So far this group has remained in line, now we will see clearly what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about Mother's Anthem: even those who are not a crime, but if you allow me, I am not an education...".
