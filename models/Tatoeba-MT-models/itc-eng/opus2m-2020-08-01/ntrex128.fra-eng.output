Members of the Assembly of the Wales country concerned about "passing for puppets"
A proposal to replace their titles with the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment of the Assembly's name, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of rallies.
An elected worker indicated that his group was concerned about the fact that the phrase “rime with Twp and Pwp”.
For non-originating readers of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crutch.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (Parti of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other forms.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English in the Yorkshire region.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation introducing a change of name, indicated that “the final decision concerning the designation of members of the Assembly is to be made by the latter”.
The Government of Wales (Government of Wales Act 2017) Act 2007 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to amend its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which has been widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission is looking for members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but a vast majority of Welsh prefers MWP.
Other suggestions seem to be made by members of the Assembly, but the effort to reach consensus could be a real head for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a draft name change law in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include further amendments to the operation of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the question of name in discussions on the draft law.
Macedonia: referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now bear the name “Republic of Macedonia of the North”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve an old dispute of several decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has stressed that the name Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said he would not take account of the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that changing names is only a small price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin reduced to silence
"The elderly people I discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street," says Mr. Adams.
"There is no more today."
According to him, it's normal for the bars to be rare.
Today, "we don't have the same dates anymore," he explains.
"We used to go to the bar as well as to his neighbor, but that's not the case."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before those responsible are imagined, and this concerns him: "they will return to the starting box sooner or later".
He added that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
"People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be mostly whites who will rush the closure of all churches, because they are unlikely to become members," he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The early white Methodist Congregation abandoned places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which preached nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was taken up by a black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops of 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, where the Blacks painted to be employed or to get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and command a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor in the direction of the church of Saint Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called "the bells of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave him a different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon in the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin has not replaced him.
Over the past few months, there has been much question of the retreat of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter would like to impose the costs incurred, even if he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old teenager injured by a shark during a lobster fishing party
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old last Saturday while practicing lobster fishing in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego television station, that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and started paying up to him to get out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was screaming for joy having a catch, and then he understood that in reality he was
had been bitten.
When he came near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I cried for everyone to come out of the water: There's a shark!" says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in a critical state.
The shark species at the origin of the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, rescue chief Larry Giles informed that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered trauma on the top of the torso.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 shark species, but most of them are considered as non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the UK aesthetic market
Sainsbury's hands low on Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and the garnit of rays similar to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetic market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home goods are falling, more extensive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is conclusive.
Supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to reuse the previously occupied space by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also boosts its boutique makeup line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the fragrance seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two stores in Sainsbury's, the first open last week in Croydon, in southern London, and a second scheduled opening in the course of the year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly inclined to make their online purchases and to go to nearby food outlets for daily food.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sainsbury's, said that sales outlets will increasingly look like large areas, as the supermarket chain tries to counter shops discount Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of shops and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two channels 2 years ago, which has, according to the group, enabled the sale of common consumer goods and the return on acquisitions.
The previous attempts to restructure the radiance of pharmaceutical and cosmetic articles from the British chain had been overcome by failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended up following a controversy about the distribution of benefits from the pharmacies implanted in supermarkets.
It was after 3 years that he sold his 281 pharmacies for an amount of £ 125 million in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was supposed to play a role in it that consisted of introducing in 4 stores a wide range of high-end skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been modified to improve the customer environment.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer wise advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beautification of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now unquestionable and changes the buying habits," added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal of an agreement of £11 million
The star of the Dragon's Den television program, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the hostor Holly Willoughby from a contract of £11 million linked to its home decoration brand, to devote to its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the brand of interior decoration and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
At the age of 37, this Morning's animator announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones furious, the star of Dragon's Den, withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration in the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources reported that Jones was furious when the child loved by television revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the trading empire of Dragon's Den Star in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, up to £1.5 million, would no longer allow him to take care of Truly, their decoration brand and interior accessories.
The Truly brand was likened to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrew, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the host's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities
and is in the process of ensuring its future for the next 2 decades.
His decision left everyone voiceless.
No one could imagine what was going to happen Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s seat is filled with products ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning's host, which is one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause millions to be lost to society because of important investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or interior articles, and the risk of a delayed launch.
Moreover, this could put an end to long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, had been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones owned 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand-name ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as an entertainer for the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A source close to Jones stated last night that he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was ugly, but we finally love each other.
Trump has mocked the media that criticize him because of his comment that some judge "indignified by a president", and to be so positive towards the North Korean leader.
"Why has President Trump yielded so much?"
he's playing, taking a voice from a TV reporter.
"I have not yielded anything at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had supported the holding of a second meeting, after Trump qualified the first, which took place in Singapore in June, from a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearisation are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy leader Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that he did not see any "responsive response" from the United States to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
On the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his Trump assembly speech, it offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," says North American President.
We were in the midst of the armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have led to positive results: the end of missile shooting tests, the release of hostages and remnants of North American military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this arena full of cracks, there's barely more than 200 standing in front of me," he said, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGOs' assistance was not supposed to be needed.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok have been scattered, but no state of national disaster has been decreed, a condition required for the launching of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they did not want international assistance, which makes things a bit complicated," said Ms. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization sets up a team to go to Palu, it still does not know if the field work will be allowed.
The spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, indicated that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian assistance.
Despite the shocks that it is constantly suffering, the country is in a cruel lack of means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Some shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm siren held in Palu, which may have contributed to human loss.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to the other is not simple.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been posted to Lombok to care for the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has placed the reform of the decommissioned infrastructure at the centre of his electoral campaign and has spent considerable amounts on restoring roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds threatened Mr. Joko's government, which was called to represent the electors next year.
The head of Indonesian state also faces pressures related to the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
Over a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, on the basis of clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Look: Liverpool attacker Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a defeat at Liverpool in Premier League against Chelsea, marking 89 minutes on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while it was about 30 meters away from Chelsea's goals, and its team was conducted from 1 to 0.
He shoots in the ball on his left before escaping a shot to the second pole.
The ball flew over the repair surface before moving to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ends up reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its road at the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to place myself, to take the ball, but players like Shaq always pull as far as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really much thinking I decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1 to 0 in the middle of the day after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker struck a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before rowing towards the middle of the terrain and sprinter on the Liverpool side.
Kovacic realizes a quick-and-coming in the middle of the field,
then made a beautiful deep shot that brings Hazard to the surface.
Hazard passed the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a shot from the left foot behind the doorman of Liverpool, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Neapolitans in the group phase of the Champions League, Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at San Paolo de Naples Stadium, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in Europe League of UEFA, at 3:00 this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: The number of tsunami victims is 832
The Disaster Management Agency reported on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami assessment reported 832 deaths.
Many inhabitants are trapped under the debris of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, informed the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was surrounded by debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of beating a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found at Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 7:55 p.m., the 44-year-old woman with a knife stroke was discovered on John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the residents of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
The police captain, Brian O'Hagan, made the following statements: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who would have seen or heard anything suspicious of contacting us.
In particular, I call on taxi drivers who could have caught something on their Dashcam and ask them to provide us with all crucial information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman presented themselves at the scene of the crime and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is under way and the police reported that they informed their parents near the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him voiceless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer confirmed that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene,
Repeating: "It's too horrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were posted inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several agents monitored the building on the inside side of the cord.
Anyone who has information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Czech Crime Agency at 0800 555 111, and record 247 of 30 September.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considered Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it "revisionist attempt".
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that "in view of the current debate about the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's one erected in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell did not order or lead the iconoclasm during the British civil wars.
It is likely that one sacrificed his or her person for the actions committed by his or her ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, carved by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration that we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said at the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean of course the monarchy.
Whether or not this representation is accurate is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century shaped the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be emphasized and commemorated."
China: a pig kills a breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a South-East China market.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered with blood near a grocery store on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject pig vaccines into a pig shop on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday, in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out that a door to the neighboring china was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was coming out of his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighs 250 kg has mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the cousin of the breeder, said "his legs were crushed and covered with blood."
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death was neither owned by the breeder nor by his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incident and to allow the police to collect evidence.
Mr. Yuan's family and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks against people have already been reported.
In 2016 on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously hurting the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig placed a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away.
In 2012, while an Oregon breeder had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this kind of behavior.
"They are rather animals players,
very curious kids... they have no intention of harming.
Just show them the respect they deserve," he says.
The remains of hurricane Rosa should cause severe precipitation in the south-east of the United States
In accordance with forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause an aversion in north-eastern Mexico and the south-west of the United States over the next few days.
The winds were at 135 km/h (category 1 hurricane) from 5 a.m. on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is supposed to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows east, to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches Monday from the low-California peninsula in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical moisture to the north, in the southwest of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the south-west over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall between 2.5 cm and 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden raws, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The aversions will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, particularly in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in regions of the south-west, in particular a large part of Arizona.
Rainfall spreads are likely to cause rapid flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Intense rains could convert canyons into torn rivers and thunderstorms will produce wind gusts and dust whirls by places.
The approaching depression will give rise to abundant local rains in some southern regions of the country, on the Californian coast.
The rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could lead to low debris flows and make the chassis sliding.
It could be the first rains of the region's dry season.
Dispersed tropical showers will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
High rainfall will fall across the four corners of the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Important temperature variations are expected for the month of October through the United States due to the refreshing of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain hot,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will undergo considerable temperature gaps on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will force the infiltration and intensification of itself again.
Most of the center and east of the United States are expected to experience a hot October start, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other north-east regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the season average.
The day-to-day forecasts indicate that temperatures should be higher than the average in the east of the United States during the first 15th of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 television stations Thursday, the seizures of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of assaulting her sexually in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse continues, the broadcasting services interrupted their usual program on Friday to announce a scene: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Senate Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct a one-week prosecution investigation.
In front of the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured 100% that Kavanaugh, under the effect of alcohol, had engaged in attacks on his person and had tried to remove his clothes during a high school night.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, claimed to also be 100% sure that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial has probably reached an audience of over 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures of other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose entertainers largely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most watched channel during the audition day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with a hearing reaching 3.26 million.
They followed CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), always according to Nielsen.
Interest did not weaken once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama playing Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a communiqué in which it would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was taken by protesters while trying to take the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
Flake dropped his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of the live interpellation.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," one of the women launches.
"Do you really believe that he tells the truth?
You hold power while so many women are poor."
Before the elevator doors had been closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and would say so more at the committee meeting.
All the cable and broadcast network channels covered the session live a few hours later, while the judicial commission was preparing to vote on the procedure for advancing the appointment of Kavanaugh by the entire Senate.
However, Flake indicated that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on the charges brought against the candidate, which the minority Democrats claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by discussing with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He took his decision after having met with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance sheet, as the Republicans would not actually have obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault charges.
Great Britain: May accuses Brexit's opponents of "small politics"
In an interview given to the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project of leaving the European Union, of making "small politics" at the expense of Britain's future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks against his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "really ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected to be the cause of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a fatal shot suspect who led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was killed and accused of second-degree murder, reported the Baton Rouge police service.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the change.
Found at the crime scene, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police being responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the medical examiner of the parish of Baton-Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by a bullet wound that crossed the head and stayed in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their "commitment and quest for justice".
Sims was only 20.
1.98 m per 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Red, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rebounds per match during the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach said the team was "devastated and in shock" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We're reviewing this kind of event all the time," Wade regretted.
Mexico: an ash crack volcano
From the ashes escaping the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Reduction Centre recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The centre monitored several earthquakes and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On social networks, images showed fine layers of ash covering windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity at the volcano level at 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.1 hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between the police and the separatists on the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona following clashes between independent protestors and the anti-semitting police, while thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repulsed by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and coloured powder at them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not fill tourists.
Heats also exploded later in the day, while the police used bricks to contain clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence were "not forgotten nor forgiven" and faced unionist partisans shouting "long life in Spain".
14 demonstrators who presented mild injuries were treated according to the local press.
One year after the referendum on 1 October, judged illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain still alive in the independence region.
A overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low rate of participation, the secession opponents who largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the Catalans from accessing the polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
This was the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said that he had no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"We witnessed last year at a great time.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a dead end," he laments.
Despite their capital victory, though thin, in the regional elections last December, independent Catalan parties had difficulty maintaining momentum this year, many popular leaders were exiled or detained pending trial for holding the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old mechanic, who filmed the demonstration of support for the police on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand and on the other.
"The tension only rises," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison pending a trial since last year, announced his intention to apply for election to the European Parliament next year.
"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government," he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men Persuasing a Home by Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after several dark days on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballenagaard Crescent Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrow shots.
Livingston wins game 1 to 0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal is to win Livingston
Recently ranked, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games in Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to rank in 2nd position, on an equal footing with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premiership league this season, and must face the Hearts team on Sunday, which brings 8 points.
But before then, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it extends its route of 6 games in the division, and its main coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can last to have not yet lost the slightest encounter.
Livingston has missed an opportunity in the face of excited opponents
Holt's team could have made progress long before it scored, because their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to go through but remained stuck in the opposite direction; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
Livingston's team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing that it could interfere with them by working tactics.
That's where the decisive goal is.
The Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to catch Menga, who took a touch and recorded a goal in the middle of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves facing an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only rarely worried.
The second half-time experienced the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Ranger Allan McGregor stopped a hit by Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to play one of Livingston's plans.
Livingston's guardian rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the arbitrator, one for the provocation of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a lack of hands.
Livingston 's "Female" - Analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the merit comes largely to Holt for having since his motivated arrival a team
who has many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grand and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in haleine for the entire duration of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talents.
They missed one last chance and only managed to cross the other side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of a painting.
Mixed Home of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Several issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
On the basis of security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protestors from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to his country.
The cleavage that emerges from protests reflects Erdogan's dual vision: a visitor welcomed in hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies following a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 local hours, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent route from Deptford south-east of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescue arrived on site, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London police reported that the officers were doing everything in their power to identify the individual and to prevent his or her relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus diversions have been set up. It is recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 officers injured in a riot
The senior security officer said that six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot started in HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, about 09:30 local time this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized riot officers were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On the spot, the agents were treated for mild facial injuries.
A prison management spokesperson said: "From trained personnel were deployed specifically to restore order in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences prolonged."
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals who are considered the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-combat officers were sent to prison to prevent a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked staff with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by steep crusades (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is probably going to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading towards the southwestern desert with what remains of energy. This region could be hit by swift crusades.
The national meteorological service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with announcing rains from Monday evening.
The national weather service based in Phoenix stated in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates at the National Hurricane Center include 5-10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the south-west desert including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be lifesaving for drought-affected regions that are not exposed to the risk of sudden rawness.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial to the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, just over 40% of Arizona has at least one extreme drought, the second most serious category," says weather.com.
The hurricane Rosa begins its way on the coast, on the peninsula of Basse-Californie.
Always with great power on Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the strength of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and lead to flood risk.
"In total, between 7.5 cm and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm."
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the border of Arizona Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. It will cross Arizona and southern Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
" Torrential rains are expected in Lower California, north-west Sonora and in the desert of the south-west and are the main danger," explained the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitation will result in potentially death-threatening creeks and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested indicted for attempted homicide after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday about 4 a.m. Local time.
He was sent to the hospital. His condition is currently stable.
The Avon and Sommerset police reported arresting the four young people (age 17, 18 and 20) on the night of Radstock.
Officers have launched an appeal to people who may have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been a victim of the wickedness and anger of democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the wickedness and anger of democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of the Congress on Thursday, rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she had been sexually assaulted several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" today.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished jurists, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump stated that the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to the statement of a member of the Republican Party to CNN.
Indonesia: an earthquake and a tsunami are making hundreds of victims, the balance sheet is continuing to grow
On Saturday, the authorities reported that at least 384 people had died, most of them being carried away by huge waves that hit the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of Celibas.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when six meters high waves submerged the beach at nightfall. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People didn't run away immediately, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Disaster Management Agency (NPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not happen alone. He drove cars, pieces of wood, dwellings, he took everything with him," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing to the trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air images published by the Disaster Management Agency show destroyed buildings and stores, distorted and collapsed bridges, as well as a water-covered mosque.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes have been felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday was 200 times higher than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have broadened the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, damage is considerable; thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that human and material losses could be larger than 300 km north of Palu, a region called Domanga, the closest to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications were "completely paralyzed" since Dongalga, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," La Croix Rouge said in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disseminating the information a tsunami had affected Palu, although officials said that the waves had arrived the time the alert was published.
A shared amateur video on social networks shows a man on the floor of a building freneticly shouting to passersby on the street that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the images immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a general power breach that cut all communications to Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to provide aid by cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened in the context of rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centers of Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: The tsunami victim's record is rising, with more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
The staff of World Vision of Domanga arrived healthy and safe in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters established in their offices' courtyard. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to those affected, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not yet the case.
"This disaster is always considered regional," explains Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares it to be a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, relatives of the missing persons were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, Gendon Subandano, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, added Mandagei.
"As an elder in the discipline of paragliding, I have experienced my own drama," he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon reported that he had desperately sent messages WhatsApp to the athletes at Palu who were attending the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
"I think they never received my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtilize $26,750 when charging an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport police department.
The driver of the vehicle was immersing a distributor in the entertainment complex and preparing to feed it, explains inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a money bag for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leave the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Anciently known as Kanye West."
41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to the Saturday Night Live show, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his coming for "emotional reasons," explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation of its current pseudo professional, this nickname also has a religious significance for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you," explained West earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us.
I passed from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye - the reflection of good, evil, confusion, of everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who collaborated with West in the past, also played on the lines of union and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO states that it will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody reprisals of law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on Tlatelolco's place to "never use military force to punish the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened the fire at a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people at the time the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors have made IA announcements, while an official IA strategy is missing in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the innovation leader AI by 2030.
"Dualizing funds for research in the IA area would be a good start, as all other countries have a lead on the United States, and we are looking for the next major discovery in IA," says Lee.
Double the funds could double the chances that the next key stage in IA comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that beat the best-class American Othello player. He then joined Microsoft Research's management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain funding from the government.
"It's not China that owns university leaders, it's business," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large academic names to work on IA.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers," he said.
The Council of State Affairs of China unveiled its new generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," explained Lee.
Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academic partners. The White House has announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called Next AI.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in IA research.
At the same time, American legislation which works to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard during a referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of Macedonia of the North. This change would resolve a dispute between several decades old and Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of which is known as Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name represents a right on its territory and has opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents claim that change would affect the ethical identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia, a majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote during the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% participation required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for accession to NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to the supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the prize to be paid to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which has escaped the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the aegis of the European Union, which means a safer life for every one of us," said Dr. Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the vote was not legally binding, sufficient members of parliament affirmed that they would follow the result of the vote and make it decisive.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 13 a.m.
But participation was only 16%, while at the same time it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that had mobilized 66% of voters registered at the end of the vote.
"I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the vote for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumi, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to join the EU and NATO, but we want to go through the big door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from necessary investments.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr. Zaev after filing his newsletter.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma channel, estimated participation at 57%.
70 per cent of the voting participants said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50 per cent of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-West government policy since its power-taking in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, leads a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 game on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's goal, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine editor received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before diving in the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He turned around a defender before evicting the others right next to Brighton's purpose.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's guard Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has a few problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, team coach, to journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were fortunate to have it marked at that time."
But Sterling had given the initial advantage to Skyblues during the First League game,
29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on Brighton's field.
He sent him to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few clicks before taking Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 1255 Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the trouble-fests against the Rockies
Since the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to run into a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play on Sunday against the Rockies of Colorado, but only in case of an elimination match for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies took 5-2 to the Nationals on Friday night, but they always seek to secure their title as first division.
"Although this game has no stake, we want to crowd the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and facing a team that will probably play at the highest level I have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals are still to announce a launcher starting on Sunday, but they would be inclined to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th departure, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The right-winger of Washington is 18-7 with an average worth of 2,53 points and 300 withdrawals on 220 marches and two thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation that generated his support to Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a major issue. I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever. That is why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this terrible radical group, really horrible, democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They care about whom they hurt, whom they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we won't give them."
Democrats are on mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it on the last four days," he added, before calling the democrats "in anger, evil and lying."
He referred to the Justice Committee of the U.S. Senate and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led him to be let down by the public.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Have you disclosed the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it was.
It is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When activists from the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censure me, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of members of the Labour Party who are not welcome, all because they have expressed our ideas.
My Parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she rose up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour meeting Friday said: "We want the assembly to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the Friday evening general assemblies were during my eight years as a Labour Party Parliamentary.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case for many meetings and the promise of more mild and more respectful policies has been forgotten for a long time if it has never been taken into account.
It became clear that the opposing views were no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took power. The colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political vision began to wait for me to return my jacket and take positions against my convictions, whether it be national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I followed an abusive tirade on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be a party member.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I had received were of a political nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who are faced with a lack of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not bow their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in today's policy is the standardization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is restricted by motions of challenge and changes to the rules of selection.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years: to lower your eyes, not to express my ideas so strong, and everything would be fine.
But it is not to act as I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schooler, because the neglect of the Thatcher government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have had a desire to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as local counsellor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and disputes with current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country goes to a Brexit which will affect the homes, businesses and public services. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunity will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for the Nottingham East electoral district.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains invincible
Two late trials may have failed the final result, but no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph after the intense game day of the Scottish rugby championship at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the ranking and becomes the only team defeated by the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they seize the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this match.
"So far we have been tested. But we remain invincus, so I must feel happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose congratulated Ayr: "Good to them, they were more effective than us and they were able to seize the opportunities."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the right position, but a yellow card for the Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the figures speak. Jason Baggot took a non-transformed test.
Climo has aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time. It has marked and transformed a solo test to mount the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose started well in the second half-time and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
A long wait was followed due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a sawmill. At the retake, Ayr resumed the fronts with a Stafford McDowall test transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an unprocessed test by Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team took over by hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tacling Climo while he did not have the ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's apple, which was progressing.
Clima turned the test, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wingman away for the fifth home team test.
Still Game Star Launches in Restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, has decided to make a career in the restaurant. The comedian has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-animizes with his long-standing partner on stage, Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the ninth series that comes will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "flowering environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way towards the Pacific
Marines patrol an armored boat in the La Paz naval headquarters.
Public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Titicaca Lake to Amazonia, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: "The sea returns to us by law.
Retrieve is a duty."
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast for Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still well present. Just as the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades. Bolivia has indeed been awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be made on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will take a decision in favour of Bolivia's application. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial struggle for the re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will take a decision in favour of Chile, and that few things would change, even if a positive decision was made.
The United Nations-based forum in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant a Chilean territory, and it stated that it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may have been harmful to him for the past four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined all the remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very complicated to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also questioned the fact that Morales, who remains to date one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political bee.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get rid of the past."
North Korea asserts that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that his country did not defend itself from nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at the time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Jong One, current North Korea leader.
Ri states that it is "chemistry" to think that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that will put an end to the Korean war will bend the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But the seriousness of Pyongyang's resignation of an arsenal that the country considers as the sole guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month, in order to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades reveal the latest trends in curfew, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect you from the sun at 100%, stop looking.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of overwhelming oversized hats during a PE19 parade that honored the fashion week style of Paris.
All the more extravagant hats the others invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their drifting pieces into the parades.
Valentino's lightpiece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a broad edge evoking a feather, which wrapped the mannequins' head.
The other oversized accessories included jewelry-ready pastries, a witch hat and even an pineapple. But these pieces were not imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had their lips stitched and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than the High Couture.
One creation looked like a diving equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another had thought of a molten ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the path of the "Bomba", the broad straw hat that the stars tear, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-to-use hat that flooded the social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the swimsuit mannequin that wore it.
The bag in burnt orange raffia, decorated with raffia fringes and a handle of white leather, was the master piece of the PE19 parade The Riviera de Jacquemus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in the shops next summer. The creator has so marked the spirits that it is obvious that there will be demand for overcrowding accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills Are Essential to the People of the World
Scotland's independent schools maintain a school record of excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new outstanding exam results enhanced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) seek to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools are working to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a school-based curriculum, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest rating, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Languages as subjects are now organized as are science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey of the British Employment and Skills Commission carried out in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers' difficulties in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of his career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real benefit in the future through this sustainable skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not master a foreign language enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have better chances of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach relevant languages for the United Kingdom in the future of 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary for their success, no matter what their future holds.
It is clear that, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do this.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make its debut with Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look at LeBron James's beginnings at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Laker Coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play yet.
"More than one, less than 48", said Walton on the official Lakers site.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After the training, early in the week, James was asked his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to be ready."
Trump Campaign in West Virginia (TV Channel)
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stopovers, especially in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
As the vote on confirmation of the vacant post was postponed to the Supreme Court, Trump sought support for the forthcoming mid-term elections and prevented Republicans from losing control of Congress at the November vote.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 (Eastern Time) this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the candidates' hearings at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until one week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans win the field for November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American president thus stated in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congressional control is such an essential element of its program that the President will return to as many states as possible at the beginning of this election campaign," said Reuters, a spokesperson for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, programmed at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media."
On Saturday, it will be the second visit in one month of Trump to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is being held back in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come here to try and relaunch it in polls," said Simon Haeder, political science specialist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team is ready to fight to keep hope on the approach of the simple Sunday
After three simple, Saturday afternoon ants could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The swing swing swing movement is a sports concept invented from all the pieces but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever during tournaments such as this one.
Where, then, would they find the momentum now?
"They were going with six points in advance and now four, so this gives us some wings," said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Europe has, of course, the advantage of four points in advance and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a little wind in the doll and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and can bet on getting each three points out of four.
Spieth has shown himself terribly effective from tea to green and set the example.
The screams of energetic joy intensified as his game advanced. A crucial putt allowed him to equal the fourth part while Thomas and were taking him two downs after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game at the 15th hole, raised a similar cry, from those who tell you that he still believes the American team in high school.
"It really has to be determined and focused on its game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players right now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as attested by the story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four matches and is not entitled to error.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones not to make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way in which their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd deligate them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to which a potential European victory is to be earned while the sun lies on the National Gulf.
Preferably, both at the same time as different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, hero of the morning fourballs, while he was teaming up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent Spanish and Swedish into a hole they could never emerge.
On the other hand, no one's here on Sunday to help you.
The fourballs and the ants are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and the ones they don't give, and how a strategy can shift in a glance.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made considerable progress during the last day, but this ant session has also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 on the United States during Saturday's four-balls and ants.
The duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari carried the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods in distress, which enabled them to score four points so far.
Determined to retain the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by imposing 3-1 during the morning furballs, in the face of a disorderly American team.
The United States has demonstrated greater resistance in the ants and won two victories, but they have failed to overcome the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must necessarily pick up eight points on 12 Sundays in order to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to pick up four stitches, while Molinari and him, named "Molliwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history to get four points during their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the four-balls, they beat the pair of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who slashed during the two Saturday matches, shone a few times, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and ants, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well-rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the ants, winning victory 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, in a cool but clear time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the furballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the ants, they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, had nothing but to do nothing to keep its trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea states that disarmament will not be "in any case" unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions strengthened its confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in these circumstances.
At the World Organization's Annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill last year", such as ending nuclear and missile trials, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology
"But we see no corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of trust in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, under such circumstances, we are excluded from being the first to disarm unilaterally."
While reiterating the well-known complaints from North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps progressively, its statement was important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore at the first summit between an American President and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to working for a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea proceed first to denuclearization and increases pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even opposing the "declaration of the end of war".
"Those who think that these sanctions can make us rain do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our distrust."
Ri made no comment about the second summit between Kim and Trump in front of the United Nations by the U.S. leader earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a dead end."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he stated before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point the North Korean missiles on North American territory after President Trump had qualified Kim as a “male” missile man on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, did not praise this year on the courage with which Kim applied disarmament measures, but added that much remained to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea would disarm.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that no time frame had been set. "It may take two years, three years or five months; this is of no importance," he said.
China and Russia argued that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must be firmly and systematically maintained until full, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to stem the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, but in the hours following, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean President, Kim is demanding the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to standardize relations with Washington.
Harvard: students take rest courses
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all first-cycle students to sleep more and to fight against the growing machist tendency of studying caffeine all night long.
One professor noted that most of the students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first in the United States.
It was after giving a conference on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
In the end, a student approached me and said, "Why do they tell me that only in the past year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of Health Services at the University, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The hour of course consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing various objects (coffee rate, curtains, basketball, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical benefits and the importance of integrating a routine before bed.
In another section, participants learn how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not instantly change the behaviour of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know this information - in the same way that you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," said Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of "pasting a white night" still exists, and he adds that the growing pressure and modern technology on students makes sleepiness a growing problem.
Having sufficient and good-quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain into mode of inanitation, making them hungry permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He stated that this course had opened his eyes and had pushed him to insist that he be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all third-cycle students to follow a similar curriculum before joining the renowned institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide both the time of bedtime and the time of awakening, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleeping disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Menga's goal is to bring down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered a new blow outside, Dolly Menga's attack leading the disarranged team from Steven Gerrard to Livingston towards a 1-0 defeat.
The team of Ibrox had hoped to record their first victory on the move since his 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team had inflicted on Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team drifting, eight points behind Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to match.
While Rangers are now dropping to sixth place, Livingston rises in third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which swept Ayr in half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a point from Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team suffocating his opponents each time.
The Rangers may have controlled the possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more.
They should have scored two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's purpose, but the middle of the field let his chance pass.
Keaghan Jacobs then hit Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have benefited from a penalty after the free shot when Steven Lawless and caught him in a collision, but Arbitrator Steven Thomson dismissed Colombian demands.
The Rangers took advantage of only two shots in the first period, but the former guard of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was hardly disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria hit.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' arrest.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher handed over the balloon to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard reacted in the middle of time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the wing appeared before Morelos, but impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston has continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long bullets on long bullets.
Holt's team could have taken advantage in the last few moments, but McGregor did well to repel Jacobs before Lithgow went along with the goal.
The Ranger replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again called for a penalty at the end of the game while he was caught up with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanach : The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNE ACCOUNT... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as Geiger meter.
A pillar of science since then, Geiger has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film " Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, we can actually hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity."
Evans: "So say, it's sure to jump there!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" and kill cancer cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting and modifying immune cells from a patient into a laboratory
They can then "detect" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose aim is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting and modifying immune cells from a patient into a laboratory, so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally re-injecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein "leads to an increase in several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, which consists of removing immune cells to "learn" to target cancer cells, has been demonstrated in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Coifer of a MAGA cap, Kanye West launched into a Pro-Trump diatric after its transition to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was horrified on the stage after a demarcated performance during which he praised American President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to be in the election in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang by wearing a Make America Great Again, West took the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He is racist!"
"Well, if racism were to worry me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL show started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been broadcast, the record of the Western diatribe has been relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the backseat because of his helmet.
"They pressured me.
They told me not to come with this helmet on my head.
They pushed me!
And then they say I'm in a gouffre," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the guffre?" and said he would wear his superman cap, because no one can dictate his actions. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted him from the public at least twice, and members of the SNL appeared embarrassed, reports Variety. One person on the spot said to the magazine: "A silence of death has fallen on the whole plateau."
West had been called to replace the last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disarranged many people by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the most courageous spirits: TENU TEEN TEEN TEEN TEEN THE FOULE."
But Karen Hunter, the broadcaster, tweeted that West was simply "be true to himself, and that is absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or by supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out a negative ideology for my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogg rapper named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fire, which changed his name as a symbol, then that of the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: Indictment of attempted murder after assault on the white gun in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Court of First Instance in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its fine blade role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent fantastic medieval series.
But the 31-year-old actor took the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to be turned into hard cooks to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that he said "something is wrong" and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of the #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a covert from Game of Thrones, also aged 31, confessed that he had "firmly" to address this issue.
"Personally, I think deeply that we have abused masculinity."
"What lessons have we taught young men who become adults about the problem now?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What behaviour is innate, what behaviour has been inaccurate?
What does television and the street teach young boys who are encouraged to think that they must behave in this way to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change this?
There's obviously something that's wrong."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do prologues or suites when the series would end next summer, claiming that he ended with "the battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will be the star of a recovery of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now," he says.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, Leslie's family domain.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reported an increase of 14 per cent of its people with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are concerned.
Almost 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients were contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country following transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was virtually zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference held in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies suggest that 70% to 90% of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government has promised since 2003 universal access to drugs against HIV.
Maxine Waters denies that a PDO employee has disclosed information about senators, and denounces "hazardous lies" and "complementary theories."
On Saturday, American Republican Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of her team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to legislators.
Los Angeles Democratic stated that these statements were supported by experts and "extreme right" websites.
"False lies, lies, and still infamous lies," Waters responded in a Twitter statement.
It would appear that the disclosed information included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information was posted Thursday by an unknown in Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of messages was associated with Waters' office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information."
"This false claim is completely false and a true lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticisms, including by Ari Fleischer, the former White House press release.
"This denial is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temperament needed to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
She mustn't be provocative.
It must not question the reasons of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also reported his reflections on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned “the authorities and services responsible for the enforcement of the relevant laws” about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English still hit. Parody by Rowan Atkinson, undertended spy
It has now become a tradition of looking for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and it seems to apply to this resumption of Johnny English action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satir on the issue of the obviousness of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes etched and rubber face, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comical creation designed for a non-English film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his questionable attempts to glamorous charm, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the type that performs a small note in Les Chariots de Fire during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, he is also inspired by the traveller and the man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the television ads Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has a friendly moment or two.
I liked Johnny English as he approached a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and impossible Mission themselves make up in full confidence with comedy.
Humour seems more oriented towards children than toward adults and, for me, Johnny English's mesaventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent film gags in Bean's character.
The perpetual premise of the present is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer hacker infiltrated the British supersecret web network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great disarray of agents in service - a weak role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that causes the vessel to overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this almost-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to get under his teeth in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means that Johnny English himself must be disturbed, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school teacher, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful farces here, because English offers a spying academy like Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-term partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who create great trouble with Her Majesty's secret services, consider the action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the influence of the technological billionaire charismatic, which is said to be capable of solving the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of tedious jokes: under the disguise of servers, they set the fire to a brilliant French restaurant; they create a chaos by falsifying on the luxurious sailboat of Volta; and English triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
All the arrests are secured for this last sequence, but despite all, there's not bad things for the children in all this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't help but think, as for Johnny English's other films: Can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really enhance his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to have developed a plan for the British to be able to work for four days but to be paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn must examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to pay the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would agree with the party's economic agenda and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party said in Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not take place in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalance the economy for workers as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week does not constitute a party policy and is not considered by the Party."
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's work conference to give details on his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power in the hands of "anonymous directors" and "profiters" in public utility companies.
The alternate chancellor's plans also provide that current water company shareholders may not recover their full delivery since the labour government could operate "deductions" due to alleged deviations of conduct.
It has also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into business boards and the creation of an inclusive shareholders' fund that will pay 10% of private business capital to employees, which will cover up to £500 of dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy trust "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed from at least one week after the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a public interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than her South Carolina colleague.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"By going to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him "Have you done this?"
It was resolved, determined, without misgivings."
However, Graham's vote seems to be engraved in the stone.
"I have made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it should be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she named couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I see nothing new that changes."
What did the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star-booking and equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now at its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people running to the Great Lawn of Central Park in order not only to benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the festival, namely ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is an extension Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), viewers were required to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, calling or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of the population in the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its objective in the remaining 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really allow them to persuade them to call for action, or is it just another example of "precitiveism" - a situation where people really think they make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion, which are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or lifted.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed themselves to "helping children develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda 35 million pounds of Sterling aid to end malnutrition in that country after receiving over 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the crowd Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the The Power of Nutrition program at a concert that took place in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following the company's over 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, as the great movements of civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary to the Interior
In order to avoid Russian energy coming into the markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the American Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary to the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are in the Middle East with the aim of negotiating energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed the participants in the Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "energy consumers' spokesperson" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in reality identical.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying that it has "more than one string in its arc" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has committed to dynamising the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration representatives, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the "inappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the current capacity for up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin asserts that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech delivered in September in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary for Energy, the Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said "I believe we share this opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has led to negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of presenting herself to the 2020 presidential elections, said the senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was planning to introduce herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top," she says, The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider presenting my candidacy to the presidents."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public gathering, saying he was " driving this country in the wrong direction."
"I am very worried about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and the candidate for the Supreme Court of the latter, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters are not of the opinion that it is expected to take place in 2020.
According to the survey of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe Political Research Centre, 58% of the “probable” Massachusetts voters stated that the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of Democrats very much to mention for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin evokes Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged in connection with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son currently experiences, what he feels when he comes home, I can connect him to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers are coming back," she told the public at the gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "the taboo subject" and said about his son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, hardened, questioning whether they respect what their comrades and members of the air forces and each other gave to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial dispute over the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial dispute over the new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and the district filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum-seekers who challenged this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been revealed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had assaulted her, but the U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled a decision issued in 2014 by the Board of Appeal of Immigrants, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing marital violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District Attorney General of Columbia, stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is unaware of decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said the amicus curiae in his memoir.
The lawyers also argued in the memory that the policy of refusal of entry of immigrants is detrimental to the American economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asyil is granted to persons who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political beliefs," said Sessions, on 11 June, in its announcement of that policy.
"Asia has never been designed to alleviate all problems -- even the most serious -- that people encounter every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in a city evacuation center.
"At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen going to their destroyed homes, collecting destroyed property and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," he entrusted Haris to Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or to my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" by means of "propaganda advertisements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper released a four-page advertisement boasting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American daily newspaper, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of attempting to join the US parliamentary elections on November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to join the U.S. elections, Trump pointed out what U.S. officials said to Reuters to be a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters of States such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States to China and former long-standing Governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion paper published in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising into the Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"On the other hand, at the Beijing press window, you will find few conflicting voices and will not see the real reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the disturbing Chinese economic trajectory, as the media strongly obey the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying what newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans alienate electricity from the middle command elections due to the Kavanaugh debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative response, especially among women, could occur during the next mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29, The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, stated that "we cannot go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz)'s last-minute efforts to investigate the FBI were sufficient to calm the anger of the voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Counsellor and National Spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said on September 28 according to Washington's newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, the protesters sang "The month of November comes!" in the Senate corridor while the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be disproportionate," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in the suburbs and young voters aged 18-29 who, even if they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction might be alive if Republicans were to advance the confirmation.
According to NBC News, the former president of the National Republican Committee, Michael Steele, stated at the beginning of last week that "it became a mess for the GOP."
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh, but also the way in which Republicans managed the situation and how they handled it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, on the television newspaper.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, Americans appear to be divided about the credibility of the two parties, a small majority looking on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41 per cent of the people consulted believed in Ford's testimony at all or probably, while 35 per cent said they believed in Kavanaugh at all or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, following the pressure of Senator Flake.
Ford testified on oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying in Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's Solid Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as persons authorized to access such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said he was joking that Inrupt was intended to "lord the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "online personal data store" or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The particularity of the personal data store online is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working on the project and a community of voluntary co-ordinators.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee has stated that his team and they are not yet in discussion with " Facebook and Google" in order to know whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely camouflaged in an instant.
"We do not ask them for permission."
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that "the mission [d'Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid."
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a Churchman of the First World War decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only churchman in the Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and did not know that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, claimed that he was "gloriously symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after the operation of his grandfather.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent shooting of campaign cannons and machine guns".
Later, he rushed on the firing line and, with the "best bravery", he drove the line before making a campaign cannon jump on his own and accumulating three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann confided that he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night watching Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent all night watching a 206 Bellator well filled, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event had 13 combats, six of which were on the main sheet, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, the United Kingdom viewers were ironed when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to stay awake until the first few hours of the morning, especially for the fight.
A Twitter supporter described the transition to cartoon for children as "a kind of bad joke".
Regarding the transmission, the Chief Vice-President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation states that at 6 o'clock in the morning, this content was not appropriate, so they had to shift to children's programs."
"Peppa the Pig", yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about recasting, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning and we can't find a solution before Sunday or Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program moved, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more for the fans and we have wasted everything.
This is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" about sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley claims he has grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize before going to high school that "everybody wasn't like me."
As part of the first radio show 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the issue of homosexual rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual show presenter Kirsty Young took several months off because of her illness.
As a shipwreck in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all other children growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength needed for my success."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about their sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medal is now a renowned LGBT activist and has benefited from its participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was expressing himself because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without branches and thus wanted to "give hope" to others.
The world's triple champion claimed that he "did not wait" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you see so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he was confident that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had the same height and low.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I was only thinking about winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 as a result of brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be sitting in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: "Father, you won't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and he was dead to finally acknowledge that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"That was all I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home during the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, this inspired him his first choice of song - Proud of Heather Small - that accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the flesh of chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hold a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to recover to avoid this unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was removed by Captain Jim Furyk from the fourballs and ants of Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the five-large champion shared his day between the role of supporting and polishing his game at the stand in order to remedy his evils.
He has never been the greatest of the drivers, even at the top of his career. At 48 years he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the wrong hits.
And as if the course wasn't tough enough in itself, Mickelson, during the ninth Sunday game, confronted Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 matches in simple, take a good start, the Miccelson game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, he hit me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has great confidence in him.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so many things to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we feel we have to do it.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of Ryder Cup meetings.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never completely reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has his active 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven casualties, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players had the pleasure of measuring to him this week, which was fun to see.
He does much more than play."
European selection captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful journey.
The Danes played his first game in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points of advance on the Americans, but finally rose to the top of the ranking with the smallest possible deviation on the finish line, taking 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop reminding yourself that we were leading widely to Valderrama; we had a big breakthrough in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but fair," Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 ranking to win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday in the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to hell tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over before I have the points in the table.
We have a goal, namely trying to win this trophy, and that is where we have to stay focused.
I have always claimed to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what happens on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Thanks to the performances of its players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be presented and everything else goes.
It's great to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message to get to the players, it's to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind, he has to go get the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have obtained three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these overhauls of the last day, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the "Médinanah Miracle", where Europe took the victory.
"I remember every word," he explained in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
"We have important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We have established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should do it, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of conducting the counter-attack and will face Rory McIllroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn said on his selections in simple.
The new warship of Germany still postponed
According to local media, the new frigate of the German Navy should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace old warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesperson, the launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of all new frigates of the Bade-Wurtemberg, was postponed in the first half of 2019.
The vessel should have integrated the Navy in 2014, but the concerns that occurred after delivery have undermined the fate of this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Bade-Wurttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as certain stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for a period of up to two years outside the docking ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, incessant delays mean that pre-warguard ships - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made the big headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy was returning a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in the event of deployment into combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Bade-Wurtemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen class.
In addition, it appears that the vessel is heavily overloaded, which decreases its performance and reduces the Marine's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-tonnes Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the overall cost of the project - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical amount of EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion), compared with $2.2 billion in the beginning.
The problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force decreases.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Commission of the German Parliament, acknowledged earlier this year that the Marine is in fact "short of ships able to deploy".
The manager stated that the situation had resulted in a snowball effect over time, as the old ships had been decommissioned but no replacement ships had been designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Bade-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highlands area seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these single flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Garden, Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
Professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat screams and the activities of different species.
A map and a report on habitat will be prepared to prepare a detailed chart of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the populations of bats have declined considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects perch and results in habitat loss.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can the paper kill-mouses and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as the attacks of company cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, given their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation technique to identify insects and obstacles to their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspection by the perch and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only reserve of Scottish bats on the site of Thrave in Dumfries-et-Galloway, which houses eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the domain manager, claims that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have an ideal place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about bats, so that the work we do here and in other places will help us to better understand what bats need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of verifying the presence of bats before the maintenance of properties, because by destroying a single maternity nest without it, the death of 400 female and small, or even the disappearance of an entire local population, can result.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perchoirs.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have much to learn about our bats and about many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations for now."
Ronaldo refutes the charges of rape while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the charges of rape against him as "misinformation," and affirmed that people "want to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to pursue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He would then have paid him $375,000 to keep his silence on this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
Addressing its 142 million fans in a video published live on Instagram, a few hours after the broadcast of the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo described this information as "misinformation".
« No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," he told the camera the fifth winner of the Golden Ballon.
"They want to get into the pub by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on these allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage proportional to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2009 in a follow-up to the hotel-casino le Palms, Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night box, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would occur, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him to be a "man well" at "99%" but did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual intercourse, but that these were agreed.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and that pictures of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "terrorized by reprisals" and feared "to suffer public humiliation."
This 34-year-old woman states that she is now seeking to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged attack, and this summer, he joined the Italian giant Juve as part of a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret" the departure of the car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State in charge of Trade, the United Kingdom would "sorry him forever" if she had lost her status as world leader in car construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "anxiety" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border on the eventuality of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, has built nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% have been exported to other European Union countries.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concerns are that car manufacturers qualify for risks to the Brexit supply chain without agreement.
The Toyota production line is operated in "tendu flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for on-command vehicles.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, there could be border disturbances which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory more than a day at her Derbyshire factory, said the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Check Plan for Future Relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to take advantage of the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has proved to be an excellent supply chain set."
If Toyota had not been able to specify how long production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the co-ordinator of the United Trade Union at the factory and who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back."
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announces that Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rejected for a week", while the struggle for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the Special Adviser to Investigate Russian Involvement in Elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the possible obstacles to justice by the President.
The question of whether Trump will return the Deputy Attorney General, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, on Monday, he presented himself at the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump indicated that he would "want not" to return Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judicial Commission hearing which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's press man, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we can push back for another week given all the other things that happen in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press up to date."
The statement would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conference at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the scarcity of conferences was not due to an aversion to "demagogic" television reporters, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they break the gallery."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that "the president participates in more questions-and-answer sessions than any other president before him": "We checked the figures."
Press conferences will always take place, said Sanders, but "if the press is able to question directly the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it frequently, you have seen it in recent weeks, and that will take the place of a press conference where you will be able to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It's rare that there are press conferences on the ground.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times a strange appearance before the assembled journalists.
Regarding the concerns concerning Brexit, the Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary for Health wrote to EU officials working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each one of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having suffered a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Tigers' second in Tennessee, was operated urgently after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodoros 31-27.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of the State of Tennessee, told journalists that the injury had occurred just before mid-time.
"He arrived on the touch line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a sawmill and taking it to another test.
A representative of the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center's operating room.
Harris stated that there was "not yet any information about the type or extent of the injury" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an athlete student in the second year, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five placards in total Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total from the season to 18 placatings.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they purchase property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people under new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp fee if they buy property in the United Kingdom - extra money will help homeless people, theresa May will announce today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by engaging in providing more affordable housing and targeting people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp rights will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will serve to strengthen the Government's efforts to help homeless people.
This overtax - which is added to the current stamp right, including the highest levels established two years ago on secondary residences and rentals - could be up to 3%.
Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million pounds sterling per year.
About 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-residents from the United Kingdom, which raises prices and prevents prime-accessors from taking a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who reside most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a reduction in stamping rights in order to help more young people acquire a first house.
Accusing large construction companies to maintain property prices at a high level by taking over land without using them, he invited Ms. May to give up affordable housing quotas with a view to settling the UK's "real estate disorder".
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including the control of rents and the removal of "unfathomable" expulsions.
He also wished to give advice on broader powers to build new housing.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I said that I would devote my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, to buy a house as well as British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become remote and the misery of homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland Technician Jack Ross explains that his "final ambition" is to become the Scottish picker at a given time.
The 42-year-old Scottish is pleased to meet the challenge of reborn the North-East Club, which currently occupies the third place of League 1, three points from the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I had to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up following Scotland's games in Hampden with my father and it's one thing I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would only appear, on the other hand, if I succeed in the management of the club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's pickers are Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic technician states that he did not hesitate to place himself behind such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "can I bring this club back to Premier League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself a success here only if I get to bring the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant to Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa go back to third division and transformed St Mirren, who was on the verge of the relegation, into a great winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
The support of Alloa "was probably a real crossroads," he recalls.
"I really thought being a coach was better than playing.
This seems strange because I got out of it well, that I earned my life well, and that I took advantage of some appreciable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to deal with every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and stress at work, but being a coach is good for me.
I have always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my adult life."

According to one survey, the ideal time for a paint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer cannicle raised the revenues of British pubs in difficulty, but increased the pressure on restaurants chains.
The figures indicate that groups of bars and pubs recorded an increase of 2.7 per cent of their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting firm, who compiled the data, said: "Permanent sunshine and longer than expected participation by England in the World Cup have made the month of July follow the June model, where bars had an increase of 2.8%, except for restaurants, which have suffered even more shock.
The decrease of 1.8% in the restoration sector in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more points of similarity than the restaurants that are falling.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as the restorators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% per month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a specialist in recreation and RSM hotels analyst, said: "These results have been following the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in sales on the out-of-home market.
No wonder that restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, although a fall in sales of 4.8% on average annually is particularly painful, in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less timely for food business operators and time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we have known in August will give a well-deserved repeat."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in implementation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds Sterling and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one out of five children has secret accounts that he hides from his parents
According to one survey, one out of five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "false Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 - opens a social media account that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth of "False Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a "principal" account cleared to show their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who happened to fall by chance on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "rape me."
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC), 40% of 11-18-year-olds have a double profile, half of the students gratefully hold private accounts.
CSM Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online places where parents and teachers don't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for this sport's leaders to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community, and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland would benefit greatly from its participation in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had an AVC.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Physicians said that only time would seem to be if I were to recover or to what extent.
It was a great job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I do exercises of agility!

Online advertising on milk that compares mothers and cows divide opinions
An online advertising of a milking company compares breast-feeding mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is described as "the world's first silent milk," Elvie, a technology company of the general public, has launched a bold advertisement inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new milk strip offers to breastfeeding women.
In a hay-filled cow farm, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I betray myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you didn't notice it, it's my breasts, not mothers."
The refrain continues: "Pump him, pump him, feed him babies, pump him, pump him, pump him, help the women with milk."
However, advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has triggered an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of which say it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth," wrote one of them.

Another commented: "It's an understandable trauma to the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why don't you use them to advertise milk for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added: "An ad if disconnected."
Others defended advertising, for example a woman who admitted that she found the song "hilarating".
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pomper gave me the impression of being a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who draw their milk (often on their place of work or toilets) and feel like cows."
It is not an advertising that commends the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discrete-milk hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use milk say they have the impression that they are cows.
However, Elvie milk is completely silent, with no threads or pipes and is quietly inserted into a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: "Elvie milk is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By paralleling breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to emphasize the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable manner the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk will provide.
This is not the first time Elvie's milk is in one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly settled in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable. This is partly due to the fact that the Trump administration's harsh speeches and policies have made it difficult for children to invest in respondents.
Traditionally, most of the respondents themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared that they would compromise their own ability to stay in the country by bringing about a child's recovery.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of arrested persons had no legal record.
"About 80% of respondents or family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Mr.Albence.
According to the refugee stakeholders, in order to deal with children more quickly, the authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case in relation to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons found not to be eligible will be promptly expelled.
According to stakeholders and reports that have been submitted in recent months by the shelter network, the longer the children remain in detention, the more anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large establishment such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected due to its size, according to the child's rights defenders.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare themselves emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate trauma that many have difficulty in managing.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw on the field.
In an address before the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country was now in his eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "would be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have been uprooted from their homes.
He indicated that Damascus would continue "to carry out this sacred battle until all Syrian territories were purged" both of the terrorist groups and of any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom form and advise both the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem said about refugees, that the conditions were favourable for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "promoting irrational concerns" that discouraged refugees from returning.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would be concluded.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress of Idlib has led to progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and expressed the hope that military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the combatants of the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions of participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and made a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many Liberal viewers might hope, the dismissal and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
What would probably be "The most spectacular final of a presidency!"
At present, the public does not show any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, high-time ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large listening hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers during big evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand," commented Neal Baer, the host of the dramatic series of the ABC "designated Survivor" that speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an accomplished comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts : And some irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She recalls taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask him?
"He answered, "Because he made me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has a funny value.
Of course, unlike everything on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most successful viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one finds himself looking at a panel of experts for six hours to discuss how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear", on Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather vest ("a proud garment" according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered of, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
For my part, I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"If a part of what he does feels like seeing a reality show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's changing teams and changes in daily situations (to fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise we're in a trance.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he made 26 degrees at his home on the north bank of Kauai, but he stayed inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not step aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when all these crazy broadcasts were animated and people were saying, "It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside invades the toughest half-mandate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of the electoral districts of Congress that allowed two incumbents to fight the same seat.
This recently restructured district of Pittsburgh is the seat of the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another constituency during the special elections last spring.
Lamb measures another incumbent, the republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily in control of the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district gave rise to a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Committee of Congress for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a win of fairness last March at a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given a slight advantage to Democrats.
The United States has considered penalizing Salvador for its support for China and has withdrawn
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, to which Washington did not object.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's leadership.
The representatives of the Department of State decided to convene the heads of American diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, in a communiqué at the beginning of the month.
But sanctions have been provided for only against Salvador, which has received US assistance estimated at $140 million in 2017, including to control drugs and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included reductions in financial assistance and visa-oriented restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
While internal meetings were continuing, representatives from North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thereby ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence now wishes to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats made known.
And the three American emissaries are quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new severe messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson of Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that was described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst near the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying history
The next tile could be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also guide his investigation into the question of a conniving Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself in the obligation to render accounts before this body, when he is ready to appear before the electors and, perhaps, before a jury made up of his peers.
These are many "yes", and I do not claim that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had kept him in mind and rejected the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the carnage years that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed to register the president in secret and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times report is inaccurate.
"What will we say if the FBI's recent investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confined to the Supreme Court despite accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, shall we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Mr Trump accountable?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will spend a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who has formerly occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light weekly candles on the swastika table.
With this heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, confiding in front of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive null match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the League of Europe.
A knee injury has deprived the medium of Graham Dorrans from his first participation of the season until the game null 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to realize exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," said the 31-year-old attacker.
"We got into the game by thinking about getting something and we split it with a point.
We might have been able to win it at the end, but on the whole, a null match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half-time and we came back in the second half-time and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they have done a good job during their last match, however I am sure that we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and changes to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
We hope to be able to go forward now, leave the last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear of withdrawal
Although the survey participants were clearly aware of how they wanted to be taken care of, few people referred to the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent reported having spoken to their children.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't do what they need to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Wide Life Insurance Branch.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy worth repurchase to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your heritage - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the crossing.
Provide health care services that will allow you to identify a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
See also a proxy for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure payment of your bills if you are incapacitated.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"There is not only the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place."
A man was injured several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
One man received several shots shot with a compressed air gun as he returned on foot from a night.
The victim, aged about 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove region of Ilfracombe, in the Devon, when he was shot in his chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2.30 p.m. BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police called for witnesses.
Seisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced the authorities, and the balance sheet should be postponed.
As communications were paralysed, relief services were unable to receive any information from the Domanga Regency, an area located north of Palu that is more close to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
A few essential facts about Palu and Domanga, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Domanga is a region of more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastlines northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the central Sulawesi province's economy, particularly the Domanga coastal region.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Domanga have been hit by tsunamis several times over a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Domanga.
A tsunami also struck west of Dogalga in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Seismic Fire Circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which took place on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, causing 226 000 victims on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from the end of March to the beginning of April.
A few hundred people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 magnitude reached southern Java, the most inhabited island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and made nearly 700 victims.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude shook the city of Padang, capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake shook Pidie Jaya's regime in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the earthquake and the murder tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami has been caused this time, but more than 100 people have been killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have rocked the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was called for suspicions of domestic violence, contravening a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, as reported by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is held on a non-secured loan of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it is certain" when his plea was asked, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means that he may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a minor class B offence, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is under way before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a drunk weapon in connection with the incident.
His companion had claimed that he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour with PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died following the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing and the victim's balance sheet is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the impact point.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami broke down on the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York attacker who has made eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in that State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would have used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a cycling track on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, on his pedestrian and a cyclist route last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov has "intentionally" murdered the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the declaration of intent to apply for the capital punishment filed with the South New York District.
These two charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this attack, a federal grand jury sentenced Saipov to 22 counts of charges, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a careful preparation and premeditation," the prosecutors claimed, calling the method used by Saipov "hate, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The southern New York district had not called for the death penalty in the course of prosecution for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case concerning Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed to engage in conspiracy and espionage for the USSR over the two years following the cold war.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been urged to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display Daesh's flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "of course disappointed" in the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than to accept his plea for guilt and to condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member asserts that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party stated that politicians should "feel pressure" of Euroseptics - as one of the Members of Parliament of Theresa May suggested, it should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative Rear-Ban MP Peter Bone stated during the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom "had already been released" if Mr. Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the dilemma Mrs May faced to reconcile her deeply divided troops was emphasized by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of remaining in the Union which joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty maintaining his Czechs compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to remain as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Euroseptics and workers to choose between its programme and the 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted "to get rid of Chequers."
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd already be out," he said.
Wellingborough's deputy added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not been given to world wars to submit ourselves.
We wish to make our own legislation in our own country."
Mr. Bone pointed out the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people turned the page and wanted to stay is completely wrong."
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of the exit, was also present at the walk to tell the journalists: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who wander the streets and get us elected first and foremost.
Abandon Checks and start listening."
In a message directed to Ms. May, she added: Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
"Mr. Farage told the assembly that politicians should be forced to "feel the pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the framework of the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They are trying to deceive Brexit and we say to them today: "We will not let you get out of this."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I wish you would feel the pressure to our political class that is about to betray the Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has enabled us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists branded conservative banners against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives because of the security issues related to the implementation of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of presenting himself to the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed its future on Saturday at a public meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequently critical vote against President Donald Trump, was presented for the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of the speculation that Trump could face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters as part of a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked whether she intended to appear in the Chair.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman at the head of the state."
Arrest at the death of Sims from the University of State of Louisiana
On Saturday, the Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by bullet of the basketball player Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department took part in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, they had published a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man on the images.
Sims, 20, was killed by bullet Friday morning, near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims received a bullet wound in his head and got killed in his injuries," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, at 247 sports on Saturday.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was killed by Simpson.
Questioned, Simpson admitted to having found himself at the site, in possession of a weapon, and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the police service of the East Baton Rouge parish.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, of which 10 as of last season, and totaled on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix : Lewis Hamilton goes to the world title after the team's guidelines enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became obvious from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified by ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that Mercedes's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and frowned Hamilton on the flank while defending his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the first stands and left Hamilton to throw himself into the storm at the poloton's tail, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes passed through the stands a round later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage after a wheeled action that saw Ferrari's driver leave the inner part at a counterclockwise at the risk of resisting after a double attempt to defend in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21-year-olds.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tires to target a speeding arrival and lead Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands on the 44th round, but was unable to speed up the pace in the remaining eight laps, Raikkonen slamming fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valteri has done a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial commission, but he argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the Senate these last days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"Looking at the disclosures and leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you disclosed any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information...No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking of the honourable senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter from Ford in detail describing the allegations against Kavanaugh last July, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein said to the committee, The Hill.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the gathering: "I'm going to tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
In pursuit of his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to resume power by all means.
You see wickedness, mischief, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control," said the president in Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants Against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared their Friday defeat in Elite League against the Giants of Belfast by picking up the game back 5-3 to Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought equality home before Dwyer returned the benefit to the Giants.
François Bouchard was equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, ensuring their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday evening in Belfast, after being caught.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants who triumphed during the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a Kendall McFaull pass, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the set four minutes later.
During a first well-served period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt entered the service of Cownie at 15:16, with equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advance before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening toward the end of the first period.
The local team gathered together and Bouchard again equalized with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus ensuring victory for his team by marking a fifth goal at the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes during their next game Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board an earthquake escape plane
A Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died making sure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many others disappeared after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grande refused to abandon his position in the tower violently shaken at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu airport.
He remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he felt it would collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirat, the spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the country's disaster reduction agency indicating that access to the cities of Dongalga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to grow because many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be dried," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency.
Waves measuring up to six metres have devastated Palu that will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide help and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are caught everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, in charge of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived at Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that caused more than 550 deaths.
Aircraft Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man disappeared after the crash of an aircraft in the lagoon.
The airline that managed the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew members evacuated the aircraft safely.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local ships participated in rescue of other passengers and crew after the aircraft hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline stated on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft landed in the lagoon near the landing runway.
Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others had been able to slip into the water until the aircraft's rescue outlets were flowing.
He claimed that the flight attendants had panicked and shouted, and that he was suffering from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that the sailors who worked close to improving a dock had also participated in rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people to the mainland before the plane flowed in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
The Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in air carrier accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the timing of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned his file on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the area of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls from a mobile phone to trace the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night the defendant died.
Rowlett reported that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones that indicated that Telllis e was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers when he had pretended to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came across the bar on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Telllis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS, calls and coordinates from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense must begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by impersonating its music of positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has removed its origins from political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more Black?!
A New York nanny continues a couple in court for having fired her after a "racist" text
A New York nanny continues a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after having received an error message sent by the mother who complained that she was "still a Black."
The couple rejects being racist, and equates prosecutions with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his dismay by finding in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new noun, was Black on his arrival for his first day of work.
"NOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE A NOIRE," writes Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending him to his husband, she sent him twice to Mrs Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after having understood her gaffe, "sick at ease," Plasco-Flaxman sent Mrs. Maurice, explaining that their former Nanny, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Philippines instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work, then returned to her by a Uber.
Now, Maurice continues to sue the couple in order to obtain compensation for her return and claims a $350 per day allowance for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do that kind of thing," she said at the Post Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to end Mauritius's employment, fearing that they could not trust him after he had done something wrong.
"My wife sent him something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco in the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone with whom you were rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your new baby?
Let's see!"
Comparing the trial to an "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you pursue someone like that?
This is not a very nice thing to do," added the business banker.
While the file is still under way, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behaviour and their logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It's hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It's very funny, knowing what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small teddy bear, would remain optimistic about the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had a taste of "sweet woman" after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and adds that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't a pretentious man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we are proud of him, even if it is not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
At the landing, his daughter had been taken urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save his life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, and we did not expect it to happen," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him to maintain heart rate were slowly exhausting and getting out of his system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to take the shot."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, in her daughter's grief, went on the plane with the other passengers, without looking at the test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Bereaved women deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted postcards on a Welsh bridge containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm forced to feel on a daily basis," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years of age and living in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up any room."
However, he quit his job before he died, since he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm constantly afraid there's a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don’t keep quiet - you need to talk. ”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-time friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"He didn't say he felt down, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She said that her death had been a huge trauma to them, but they have to get out of it: "It's tearing up for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future was at stake as the FBI started its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited investigation in time, limited in scope - we could perhaps bring some unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "fall down" into a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will take place only in five weeks, on 6 November. If, as planned, Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the telephone to call the senators and asked them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to defuse the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of "fall" deserters under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's rise to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South unification department, said that 1,127 deserts took place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing fares demanded by passers-by were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of Northern deserters will eventually be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the very protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
The relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the context of talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that remained so far pending.
This occurred after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the broadest sense, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho imposed on American sanctions the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to undertake unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi qualifies Brett Kavanaugh as "histeric", and asserts that he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "histetric" and declared that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have treated her as "histeric," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee of the Magistrate last Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes had to scream and choke by referring to his family and school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations of " grotesque and coordinated murder" organized by disappointed Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he discredits himself with these statements and how he took them in Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked whether she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and whether the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also unfit to sit in the court where he is currently," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi also added that as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his hearings on confirmation of charges, Mr. Kavanaugh raised the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect what we say: "It's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
It's a legitimate diatric, months and years of anger that overflow, and it can't get her out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere, who told me that she too cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried: "You can think I am sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I found it brilliant."
Tears are allowed as exuberance to anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage, was having been seized by the skin of the neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always been a little terrified - who led me into a stairway.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad because they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been taken into an extra-conjugal affair on board a boat called Monkey Business and had retired from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of herself presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she told me by laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone had called it "Black White and the Seven Nains".
As the campaign was very advanced, it had slowed down in fundraising, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men were only going to give her $250.
"Do they think I have the right to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sexism - that she felt so stunned.
"You would have thought I was doing a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about the reaction of the press to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
"She cried?"
How trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming, and although the battle was far from over, a disagreement between countries could benefit in Beijing over the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by charging key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The largest increase this week has occurred with new customs duties affecting items worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds sterling), thus charging half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Every time, Beijing has responded in kind, striking customs duties of between 5 and 10 per cent of US$60 billion.
China has committed itself to bringing the United States together, and it is unlikely that the second largest rapidly vacant world economy.
Backing Washington, it's to give in to the demands, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, pressure from the American trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could introduce conditions conducive to economic slowdown in one country is in fact much more dangerous than the observers previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia, to the thinking group of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" upon the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria declares itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the spot is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six other million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of that devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the insurrection.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the bar of the 14.5 points necessary to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in difficulty during most of the tournament, pushed his kick-off into the water at the 16th hole in par-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all its rounds, becoming one of four players who have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was removed 5-4 by the least well-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olsen, from Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, leaned 2 and 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the champion of Europe of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today, it's stronger than me.
It was an exciting year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters, it's the team, and I'm glad I was able to help him," Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who beat the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, last Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride, I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 in career in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the biggest golfers of all time, who picked up 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding fairways all week, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain time when we put pressure on Europe.
We've given up.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to get together, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to bow.
We've got ourselves out of line."
Point information on the red tide: Lower concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in certain areas of the Tampa Bay region.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - which causes fear of decreasing concentrations.
The red tide covers approximately 209 km (130 miles) of coastlines, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are islands about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but in fewer sites than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations across Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations in the bottom of Sarasota County or offshore, medium concentrations in Charlotte County and low concentrations in Lee County and across Lee County, high concentrations in the bottom or wide of Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation persist in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory irritation was reported in northwestern Florida during the past week.
