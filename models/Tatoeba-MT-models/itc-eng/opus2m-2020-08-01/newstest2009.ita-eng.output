The Prague Stock Exchange at the end of the market has had a negative collapse.
After the fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
The transactions in the CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this down there is the collapse of the shares on Wall Street.
So, too, there is a market reaction to the result of the vote by the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the local financial sector.
Breakdown of shares in Asia
On Tuesday the shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day, subsequently erased some of the losses.
Hong Kong Hang Seng's Stock Exchange index during the day has deleted almost 4%, but then also some of the losses stabilized at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese stock move at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, dropped by 3.8% while the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end the losses occurred at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, has dropped by 3.6%.
"The plan for rescue action is uncertain and will influence financial markets around the world," observed the head of the Hong Kong Evaluation Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, therefore without relying on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries too will suffer consequences.
Stroke of American actions
The US Parliament rejected the financial system support plan on Monday, for which 700 billion dollars (roughly twelve billion Czech crowns) had to be allocated.
The legislators thus ignored President Bush's appeal to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The American actions on Monday have suffered a massacre and the main indices of the actions have recorded the biggest collapse for over 20 years.
The Dow Jones index has dropped by almost 7% and a collapse of such size was observed last time in 1987.
The index was lowered before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it fell free.
Congress has resigned: the US government can extend 700 billion dollars to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators broke ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion kroner).
But it's not said yet.
The representatives of the Congress, therefore, need to define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
Sunday told Reuters agency, chairman of Barney Frank's Bank and Financial Services Committee.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening financial markets.
But then we will have to return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, we will reach out to market aid.
Paulson: Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package," Democratic Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislators' delegates met the night between Saturday and Sunday with the American finance minister Henry Paulson, to finalize the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-conceivable mortgages from financial companies, which lead to serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
"We are fulfilling the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It is necessary to carry on the recovery plan again, but I think we are," Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on the stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, the legislators are thus trying to reach a final agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
In other words, they want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the market on Monday as a result of the Congress's decision.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can stop at the last moment on some problem.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount envisaged for support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum if it has the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the final 350.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations.
Even though the President may veto this decision, Congress may overrule its right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, i.e. to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, whose price has fallen due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've prepared everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law Sunday and the Senate Monday," as the Republican senator mentioned.
The American President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's positive developments and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of gold parachutes
The chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the main spokesperson, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the fractionation of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes to the managers of the companies participating in the programme and is setting up a committee that will monitor the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a big step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan relies on help to owners of homes that have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates which it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly debt spending for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this because we do not know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government will divide their losses," said Marek this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"More importantly, it is that already this week Congress representatives find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this most important moment," Marek stressed.
Last blood duel: MP3 players against mobile phones
We'll recommend how to choose
While almost every mobile can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is best to buy only the phone.
In spite of this, there are many reasons why an independent reader should be sought.
The choice depends entirely on how the future owner uses and needs.
Perhaps you could hardly buy a expensive high-quality turntable to listen to us on Maxim Turbonc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is not even an objective reason.
If, however, on your shelves, hard-rock, jamz or blues vinyls are sprinkled, a turntable of the sort as you dream of.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here too are the categories of prices and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader 8 thousand crowns, as well as a fan of Pink Floyd may hardly digest the caps from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes of which there's enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
To decide is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply read music, but they don't even make cell phones by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as your mobile.
Alongside primary functions, phone and texting, you can read music and videos, record both and have a camera, sometimes better times worse and maybe also can navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and palms you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle because no refrigerator can make the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on your mobile phone and first the indicator on the screen will require the battery charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones can read the music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As far as economic cell phones are concerned, they may last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get yourself to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you will not have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst lasts at least 9 hours to continuous functionality with a charging.
Another problem occurs when you download the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and not all of them can connect to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and readers alone create a multimedia library ordered by the names of the interpreters, name of the album, gender or by the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device, be particularly interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly in ease of use.
If you need music in particular as a background and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram you just need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This can now be done, clearly to any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about what your phone or the reader knows about.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of equipment supports music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its Ipod).
Best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another supplier) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is poor and usually limited only to a hit of the time of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of selling music (either via GSM, the Internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry their cell phone.
Anyone wants to listen to something in their pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, whether you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headphone.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest normally cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for common headphones.
The best and technically equipped mobile phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead the benefit of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones aren't necessarily cheaper (see our choice) really do anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of striking by mistake the start of the mobile internet network and as a result of a giant data transmission bulletin.
Which equipment to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, entered into the 2 000 kroner.
But be careful.
Base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones also do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy yourself a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you must not spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are part of the most demanding listeners you prefer to take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and the convenience of the service so that you get closer to the same MP3 player.
In this area made more way Sony Ericsson, which walkman mobiles have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players from the brands above provide you with the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 krones, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in general up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic already this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is mature enough and our operators offer almost all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Here, however, something is missing – a virtual operator that obliges traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe has already written on Mobil.cz many times.
In the end it has also confirmed ČTU, which has noted that the price of SMS is higher from us than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulating roaming tariffs, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks the competition that would really want to start the fight.
It may sound absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and cover highly over 100 %.
Instead mobile telephony operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTú) is often emphasized, Pavel Dvořák, who in the past stated that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with his own network no longer has many possibilities. (Moreover, it may be difficult to find other frequencies.)
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a significant decrease in prices, to which traditional operators would have to react.
At the same time before the entry of sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, similar voices were echoed in Britain as we did.
However, it has been shown that the place for such operators is there and that can really be successful.
Finally, we must not go too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the Virtual Operator Mobilking in Poland.
In only half a year this operator managed to conquer more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which in the Czech Republic belongs among the other U:phone.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete group-breeding.
In order to actually function, that is, many fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not go behind, i.e., relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low price, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
For example Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS that costs as much as half as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move even bet on a group-tweet not recently.
This operator aims to specifically say about men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and you can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can also assert a similar concept as in Poland.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of services is relatively full."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have much to expect.
Mobilking's ignition will take place in other countries in our area," he said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that current operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly in favour of this view.
Rather, they try to do everything because no competing potential is created.
For a while it has not hidden its interest in the start of a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first it's better.
We have repeatedly negotiated on this possibility with all the Czech mobile network operators.
We have already been able to progress in negotiations with some of them," says the spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will have to have it by the end of the year.
But for now around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the Telefónika O2 press section.
The specificity of the Czech market also applies to other operators.
The press spokesman for T-Mobil Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 declaration: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "On the T-Mobile network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this moment we have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered at the horizon."
Vodafone concentrates its attention rather than reaching its 3G licence requests.
Adds Miroslav Čepický: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the context of spending and infrastructure sharing.
Let us consider this, from a customer's point of view, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
Competent authorities -with complicating operators
The attitude of mobile telephone operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to lower profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
Troubles around the creation U:phone testify that when operators hold to something they know how to remedy on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was pressing towards ČTU in the period of creation of U:phone to the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to public access information from the ČTú web pages.
But now U:fon serves as a topic for which to not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The competition environment of the mobile phone market has been little boosted by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that another competitor’s entry would place on him and above all on his high claims services.”
However, the attitude of mobile telephony operators is quite surprising to the complete disinterest of Czech regulators.
It is not only the attitude of the ČTU that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, in relation to the whole problem has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract of the rental of the required infrastructure between mobile operator and virtual operator had been realized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been sufficiently interesting for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, from the external relations section ÚOHS, in the answer to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators might not be surprising.
On the other hand, the office must defend the interests of consumers and, above all, take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
But of course the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and lower prices do not belong to the interests of UOHS.
It is truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question as to whether this is really just a coincidence is a matter of itself.
Similarly, the same price of petrol for all petrol is undoubtedly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section has not found any signs of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so he does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for his behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing the telecommunication regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTU, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On a market like this, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator it is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has - ultimately logically – the monopoly of his network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for UOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators do so strangely similar.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the so-called GTS Novera company) show that during negotiations with all operators encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to ČTU in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which ÚOHS is kept out of the whole matter.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of ČTU's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that many experts expected to improve the situation.
This is what UOHS representatives need to know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one looks
While we are unaware of this, the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators remains, some of which even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The prices of these companies usually reach only the pre-determined persons.
Magic is in the fact that the company against the operator is a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit such a presale.
"If the cases referred to above were presented, of which we will be interested, it could be a breach of contractual conditions, and it could result in the conclusion of cooperation with that company," replied the question in question Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile telephony operators.
Especially in the cases of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be involved.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activities of these companies, that is, they derive a non-indiferent profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not harmed in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers uses the services of these companies.
These must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the usual customers of mobile phone operators "
But this should be a little weird about Čtú.
In addition, another issue is open for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes in front of such an attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if he does not want to, he must not be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all that and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant decrease in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were almost identical - too small market, at the limit too saturate, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries in these cases, the defence regulators have intervened not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both with the formal measures both with the non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and to him came up with others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators throw from one another all the time as a boiling potato.
For our experience, we can't get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity in these cases makes them more than comfortable.
But we don't throw away the sponge.
If backstage information is right and the virtual operator will appear to us very soon, the Czech mobile phone market will be moved back.
If one of the operators consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only rarely UOHS could remain unimpeded by the refusal (discrimination) of the others concerned.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech State's Day of Recognition presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde kasov m a.j."
The new anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, chorus step and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem revisions are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and also the choir, have the clear dictionary, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year the 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde kasov m a.j." was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroupa.
He bought popularity and people spontaneously made it his own.
The first stanza of the song after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
One of the seven national symbols remained even after the birth of the Czech Republic.
How the "new" anno sounds
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will accompany you for the first time even with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the metro, tram and bus will rise the first passengers who instead of the paper ticket will have in their pocket an electronic card.
At this moment if you can search for about 100,000 people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the one from 30 and 90 days and annually (from January 1st 2009) and at the same time get their paper reloaded at Infopoints and at the offices of the Transport Company and at the Metro Station Museum, M .stek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Sizes can be purchased from yesterday's Internet to the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service took advantage of more than four hundred customers before afternoon.
Those who will start using the service via the Internet can completely forget the doors in the metro stops where so far they had to make long files for paper tickets.
The cutter is purchased via the Internet and the Opencard is charged on one of the 12 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have a platform with trained staff that will help those interested in buying on the Internet and will also register on their card the credit they have acquired." said project spokesperson Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries you will be able to load the electronic cuts on the Opencard in ATM and selfservice that are installed at the metro entrances.
How are these ATMs?
They're red, they look like ticket savers and passengers have already noticed them at the Roztyly metro stops, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný concluded.
The cutter will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after payment of the cut, you will load it above.
Electronic scissors apply from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, that the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the additional trains in the integrated transport of Prague there are the controllers equipped with card readers with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity," explained the mode of control of Filip tickets by the organisation Ropid, which develops the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated into the driver’s box.
During the ascent it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the point determined next to the box.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded cuts.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded sizes, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the validity of the cutting expires, can again go to self-service ATMs, where the cuts are loaded on paper.
The information on the validity of their documents on the device screen will be displayed here.
The South Germans wanted a referendum from the USA
The Germans of the South in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is from the letter deposited in the scientific library of the South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this wish, according to what is said, some German groups of the Sudetes turned in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This results in more than anything from the letter stored in a private archive and now deposited in the scientific library of the South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "region of Šumava" – occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Monaco agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises for American units to arrive in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," he writes in the letter signed with the words "The people who hold to Šumava's destiny with all their heart".
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the South hope only to brutality, lack of regard, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray the American president to take over the protectorate on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without respect for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you will recognize this territory as a state to us alien, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all, for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," writes the letter.
The reason why authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of thirst for revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the USA doubted the conviction of the Germans of Šumava , it would be sufficient to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or to live under the rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the post-war history, some witnesses rightly describe the expectations of the then Germans of the South.
Although the Czech Germans had to understand that they would have moved from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the people of the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the sea power of the Baltic Sea.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in the prison camp in Holštýn, the tens of other Czech Germans were going to find him to teach him Czech.
"These believed that once the Czech returned home would make him comfortable," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia, relied on the fact that on the basis of Beneš decrees, they would have been moved by the Republic.
Don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, one could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to set off on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Łebíček is expected to discourage drivers from driving dangerous behavior.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol on the wheel.
And remind him to put his belt on before leaving.
He wants to touch the conscience especially young drivers, motocyclists, pedestrians and not for the last professional drivers.
What's going to happen on the spot?
Especially people's stories that will affect emotions.
And this also testifies to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't think you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is capitalised on the plate.
And in a blood well there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The spots will "fear" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with dramatic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It is thus promised to lower the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Carrots and stick to drivers
"With drivers the carrot and cane system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and so they save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
It is important to remember the risk to drivers," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the hospital Na Homolce.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising, believes the psychologist.
According to him, the panels warning danger drivers are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel warning of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Kořán warns.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of Israeli Provisional Government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, that is, also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
This is what he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all areas (occupied), if not all," Olmert told the daily.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the Russians or spies to pass on him, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the wake of the two attacks in July in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens wounded.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the mountain of the temple, sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City. .
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he added.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, that is, in his view, the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know what they will have to give up in order to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the Hezbollahs (Scitian Movement); they will have to give up permanent support, which they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (Scitism Movement) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the prime minister.
Questions after the accident: Are the booths illegal on buses?
The law does not recognize them, you cannot walk on the bus that makes long distances
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the company Student Agency bus came out the question if the yards and passengers could move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws severely and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
Last week’s accident with which he lost his life a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the less secure seat of the bus, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can do an accident or brake abruptly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether the bus is equipped or not with standings according to the traffic book.
If passengers are not approved, they must be seated.
Student Agency buses have not set up, confirmed it at Aktuáln.cz website the director of Radim Jančura.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow the passenger movement on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from carrying out the services.
The road traffic law only recognises the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds the spokesperson Hanzelka less clearly.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law does care enough about this problem.
Depends on whether the bus has approved seats.
That's it," he says.
Categorizes buses in urban areas where there are the standings and the maximum speed limited, interurbans with standings with higher and long traffic speed without standings with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of the escorts on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Even there is not safe when a turbulence comes and the flight assistant can knock his head off."
"If the bus makes a sudden braking, of course, the laws of physics are worth it.
Same as in the city bus or on the tram.
The carrier must resolve the security of the stewards by means of an internal regulation," he also says and understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of the Stewards..
This one takes about 200.
Even after the incident, the Director considers their work dangerous.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider Steward's profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers while they leave.
They would also reduce expenses," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of the steward on his means as an interest in security.
"We have no hostess, we are already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end a fatal accident," Týden.cz said less than a year ago.
An immense tragedy has occurred.
In the accident of the line for Naples a young hostess of the region of Plzeň died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably came out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a rough maneuver, but hit it with the front right.
Jančura rejected the fact that the two seats reserved for the stewart rest had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-distance buses, they are inaccessible."
The company plans to report the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the Court’s judgment to pay the damages to the girl’s family, but a financial compensation from the offender is expected.
The revision of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to the precise movement of the stewarts on board buses.
"But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They do not consider them so much busses, they deal more with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider stewart activity as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes Mr. Havelka, who controls the safety of buses are the responsibility of the police and the security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
Words are not missing in the letter of the WestLB Director addressed to the collaborators of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could be formed "the capital market centre of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution unit with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch a "competent block" with lasting profits in such an undertaking.
Moreover, such a whole union could be a decisive push for further links in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is how it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the WestLB is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having noted some time ago the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that the time constraints on the search for a future solution.
Links between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Savings Banks because of their investment funds already know, and WestLB certainly has been talking about it for a while, even by Frankfurt.
He reported at the end of August the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas on the presentation of the invoice of the first half of the year that a merger of the house at via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which, by half, is brought by regional banks and savings bank consortia, has delegated the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with the West LB on common contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But the conversations have, as they say in the business square, just started.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees is one of the most important in Frankfurt business square, there is no talk of it the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it seemed that the Deka-Bank could join the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
There was nothing about this three-way association.
As soon as the projects were published, the Asian regional bank was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have often thought about a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end Günther Merl, president of the Helaba board, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is created, that it is necessary to approach the different public sector houses.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank could first take place with that of Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba it's not entirely good news.
If the pressure increases for other mergers, partners will be missing by hand.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although he has passed the financial crisis much better than houses in Monaco and Stockholm.
The association of Asian-Turingia savings banks that participates with 85% of Helaba, put the chain to the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain.
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses are compared.
In June Merl pointed out that the key question, with which the future of the regional banks' business model would be assured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the division of the West LB, which by that of course is not desired, could also come out.
Thus the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the desire to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the single parties with the Deka-Bank will work.
THE second weekend of the beer party is dedicated to Italians
For Elena is the first time while for Luca is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them the 5l. barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive beard and shows about 200 travellers what are the deep tones that can produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luke a pack and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, leave this evening at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Festival della Birra" , expected arrival at 6.30.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It is so noisy, says Marco, that it is not something for the Italians.
Mark who wears a long coat with false fur liner and a pair of glasses with silver wide cases belong to him the buses.
For 5 years go to Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The night ride, the day at the party, back at 22.30.
Overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the rules of Bavarian genuineness, the sickness fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at Brenner's.
There's still no beer.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better that way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plate on the A9 motorway before Monaco take a short break.
When, as planned, the Marco group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others come together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First: put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Knowing Viaggiando.it".
Second, "When they open the doors of the beer tendon, it means running!", quoted Mark early in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the posts at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, he didn't stop, and not all the yellow beers sitting on the same benches, split up in the sharp space!"
The mouth costs 8,25 Euro, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Show the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "We meet again at 22.30 p.m. here again! Do you understand?"
Yeah, I'm going for the party.
On the way one attacks as you follow the yellow beers to the trees, the road signs and even a billboard from a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "end of the Italians".
The exact data do not exist, 50 thousand are spoken of, which start to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is said that 10% of visitors come from Italy.
The Munich police are strengthened with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are in the first place with 200 medical treatments in front of the English (about 60 medical treatments) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tendon of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Nights insomnia for mortgage creditors Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed the finance minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned, that the German banking sector is not spared by critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, obtains a billionaire credit from a consortium of German banks in order to protect themselves from turbulence on the markets.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
Deep down are the losses of the Deffa affiliate.
The state financer according to a newspaper article has refinanced in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008 the bank reserves had decreased by 95% to Euro2.37 million, even the share of its own capital fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs fell to 0 compared to last year, profits from increases in both applications and certain actions as to the liquidation of credit provisions fell more than 70% of the 5 million Euros.
Thanks only to higher income from the refund of subordinated compensation costs, both from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and business management for business consortia, the negative profit was fairly moderate by about 16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 was lost in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were dismembered in the Area Bank.
Given that income in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa has been more engaged in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now depreciate the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is, dividends have been deleted.
By 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is an important financer of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the grant of credits between banks in large part dried up because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs a portion of the Depfa credit portfolio – about 50 mld. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate's notice, the group's financial needs were covered by credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of international monetary markets for the most non-functioning.
From other sources you feel, that thanks to the money the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Steering Committee said on the contrary that the HRE Group will not need the money markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the commerciality of the HRE Group is still ensured.
This is expected for shareholders and bank creditors.
In view of the dynamics and taxation of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
The financing may not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be ruled out.
After Sunday evening the bank learned what it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The share rate falls by 75% on 3.30 Euros.
They're doing pretty well in loan courses.
While front-debts are almost unremovable, they give up the courses of deferred credits.
Hits are mainly the loans of the affiliate Württemberg-Hypo understandably the proceeds with maturity beyond 2009.
Before the HRE loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of banks and the institution itself, which with the importance of the Depfa the crisis has taken place, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
If the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, it can be counted on amortization of the annuals within the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, what nobody hopes for – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But with regard to the information raised due to partial Stateisations, the probability almost certainly has become a justified hope.
It will, above all, create long-term investors some sleepy nights with the decision whether to split up with their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the return on losses for future interest rate payments.
Sylviana and the Secrets of Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, the first day of school should be at Tachibana Highschool, the girls begin to reprint: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylviana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I was just so cool to go to school.
Dressed on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
The road I had to find myself alone and fortunately I didn't lose.
The beginning of the first hour of lesson does not seem to have been fixed as well as by us in Lower Saxony.
The schoolchildren arrive slowly from 8 onwards, until 8:40 a short interview with the professor, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was up to me.
I'm not the guy who speaks willingly in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren
Since I didn't have school uniforms yet, I put on an old skirt of the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
This is how I put myself in front of the chair and tried to say well: "Soyonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday within a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, redacted and made a sign and then I heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "beautiful, sweet".
Then I ran fast in my place.
The girl next to me embarrassed, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson hour continued quietly, but when the gong played, I was assaulted in the real sense of the word.
They were all talking disorderly and laughing and drying me up with questions – then it's really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the break everybody opened their Bento.
My host mother also gave me the basket for the Lunch- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of envelope with meat and tofu..
I don't even know exactly what I eat in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
It is done, that everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under the salts, brr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of getting to know the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comic books.
I'm really curious if you can find out.
"Why exactly Japan?" asked my friends when I told them, that I would have wanted to go to school for a year in Japan.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me "
Finally, I have been reading the Mangas fervor for years.
And to better understand the comics and culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn a little Japanese.
I was absolutely convinced I'd come once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
This is where they keep us a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a scaffold escapes when they feel the danger. Does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be verified if, when they behave in the same way, they have our feelings?
Articles from well-known scientists have been published on the Internet "Edge" for some years.
6. SPIEGEEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of conscience, without me or anyone else so far been able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about the feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the reference base does not compete.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do. That means he pretends to be dead, running away or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to transmit our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, it often connects the lateral prefrontal cortex with human awareness, associated circuits (this for its direct sharing with short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis on the assumption that man even differs from the other primates is accepted.
Another dramatic feature should be presented in the way of speaking about man: since a large part of life is related to language, it is often said that it is related to consciousness.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its own experience because of the special hardware, their research will lead to great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which for science it would be easier to have access.
Animal consciousness processes could be analyzed without regard to their content, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, especially at the example of the visualization.
So for this principle, that Christof Koch und Francis Crick follow, it goes first to the neural correlations of consciousness that to causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal bark for the implementation of the display.
What, then, is the basis for feelings?
I charge them that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of his conscious brain activities.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the cortex regions, which characterize primates and in particular human beings.
With the speaking nature you create subtle nuances of feeling, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the regions of the body of the sensations of the cortex and of the head paleus, similar to Jack Pankseep, which however focused more on paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is undisputable.
Pankseep brings arguments about the fact that what for rats and human beings appears as fear, is likely to feel so with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and human beings experience the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
Does a scaffolding in case of danger run away as if he even felt fear?
In my eyes, the mere likeness of behaviour cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
And that is, neural comparison continues to help: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephalus, scarfs not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalus responsible for feelings?
And even when one could prove it for humans: how would one want to prove it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, here are progresses at neural level, provided that the same procedure is waived on rats and men.
As I don't search for language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered myopic, but I prefer to make further steps, rather than continually crashing against a wall.
I'm a practical emotional.
The President of UEFA Platini: referral to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europes with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"This is not, however, an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both the country owners of the house blow in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stages for the Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at the highest speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki said to the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer."
Many representatives of the first division only in the last season were convicted of manipulation, at the end even the beginning of the League had to be postponed at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid rudit outraged
He wanted to promote a new film, in interview he talked about the private and now he has grain with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan declared his former Dennis Quaid adultery.
He foams of anger and rattling.
Early Roses War for the former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two actors of Hollywood now quarrel with each other a bad dispute - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time expressed himself on the grounds of the failure of marriage: "Dennis has been me for a long time unfaithful, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayals she would have come to know only after separation.
The occasion for the "stolen of the soul" was the work with Ryan's press for his new film "The Women" – the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his publicly declared adultery husband was clear: it would be "unheard", said fifty-four years to the "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the last time repeats and reworks the history of our relationship".
It would also be "sorry" that to Jack, the sixteen-year-old son who had together, again "are publicly remembered the pain and subvertion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from separation, Quaid is again married and will soon become father of twins.
And therefore his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of the year 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter observed a clear decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as a reason for this the weak quote of the dollar, which would have led to a "heating desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold record in Europe
As regards flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still stands:
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the Economy Class had to pay 7.1% on average compared to 2007, long-range fuel flights would be even higher than 29.2%.
From April to June the prices of the Economy Class air tickets dropped on average by 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, however, in the first class and in the Business, price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices have fallen even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11.9 %, in the second quarter fell by 23.6 %.
As for internal German flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
Reasons for falling prices would be on the one hand low economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has squeezed.
On the other hand, there would be an agreement on open skies, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the removal of non-profit routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure – only in Europe were 24 airlines.
The HSV beats the Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburg's VS becomes a cabosta.
In Borussia Luhukay, he still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for the national player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player first came into play late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was formulated precisely, he passed it on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg arena cabins.
It didn't happen much in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of it was back in place.
Rieger has been for almost 3 decades HSV physiotherapist, enjoys an even greater estimate of some old players.
And so his warning also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol announced and raised his thumb in a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similarly: here's the second goal!
Change of position did not occur.
"Today it wasn't all good to see," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted more relaxed".
For the 1 to zero those in Hamburg must thank the head shot went to the sign of Mladen Petri (11) and the fact that the many weak players in Gladbach could not have hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol said.
The SV of Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators celebrated earlier, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the classification flashing on the screen, which legitimized their sport society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We can put everything together," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the presentation, that the provisional table certificate is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric gate as well as Jansen blown to the FC Bayern – finds itself slowly, but has not yet been able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol force relaunchs.

Dark matter influences space probe flight
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fast-frozen fuel pipes, death by freezing now falls on you.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of the space probes, with which they obtain additional swing/spin/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American search probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedient as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What amazes scholars for years: the rockets do not behave at all as we would expect according to the gravitation law.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year marked the anomaly of the Swing-by.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study strongly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of the Swing-by by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
"Responsible for anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he wrote.
From the existence of dark matter space scholars have only been aware of about 10 years.
There is clearly a force of attraction from her, whose effect on other celestial bodies is seen.
Instead, she is completely invisible, i.e. she neither sends nor reflects any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter is at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
The kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before release 6 kidnappers were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for redemption are already under way.
Germans are always in the sight of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was a concordance of Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the story of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health," said Frattini.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of an expedition in the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The backstages of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released are still unclear: so the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready to conclude the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them at surprise.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed for a ransom," the official said.
It would be "still trying to take the hostages into delivery", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had claimed from Germany a ransom of the amount of EUR 6 million; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the liberation of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release women hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should have been kept as long as the kidnappers hadn't had a safe escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
Father's abuse "leaded to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led a woman to kill herself, declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stithians, Cornovaglia, was in prison for 6 years after he admitted eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly bothered his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise harassed her and bandaged her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
Her daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and a cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and who had "molted with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
He's thought to have been killed by suffocating himself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I bound her and bound her."
"I didn't sexually bother her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when you were only seven years old.
"This unfortunate saga ends with the victim taking his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't done it, it would have been difficult for the facts to end in court."
I notice the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother have had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise she was clearly likely to be a promising and happy young success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office's official who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be accused by the Official Secrets Act, learned the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defence when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC's defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They thought this was treated internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be accused under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguard of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be accused by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over £80,000 after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given £14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million savings.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of Building Companies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of £14 billion will eventually be paid when Bradford & Bingley loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid annually to the 700 financial companies taking deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies accepting deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction company association, told BBC that he believes it is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovery market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less careful."
According to BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," Mr Cole added.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk salts 5 penny per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in the wholesale prices of her milk for an extra five penny per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Disclaimer to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him a bail for exhorting 50 million taka (729,700 dollars) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament
The case is one of the many allegations of corruption against you.
Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, long-time political rival, had been released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the next few weeks but his party, Awami League, asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military should first give the total freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, if she can remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The high court rejected the claim for bail for Sheikh Hasina by bringing that she cannot have the security since she is already abroad on the word for medical care," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall present or appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina returned home after October 17, said a senior leader of the Awami League party on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the government joined the military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for Afghan Anti-Poly Campaigns
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan lack the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, says the UN.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that you cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesperson said that this happens despite the promises of the Taliban that would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Commission's decision to oblige the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had said that BSkyB's participation hampered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB participation in ITV raised doubts about the independence of ITV, allowing Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The head of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate reminder - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the US prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecutor's Office to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation takes place when a case report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticises the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by the fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
The public prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Series of accusations concerning potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or ascertained," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said that lawyers had been fired for expired performance.
But later it appeared that the law-enforcement lawyers had not been evaluated more late than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in judicial proceedings against high-profile members of the Republican Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
American prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases on behalf of the government.
They may be fired at any time, but may not be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the storm for dismissals, and eventually reassigned his position.
A number of other officers from the Department of Justice were fired.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical in relation to Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had primary responsibility in dismissals, which had abdicated his role as leader and had been extraordinarily detached during the process.
Other officers, including Bush Karl Rove's former senior assistant, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The epic of the Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for its epic Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track of the 1977 album by Meat Loaf.
Coldplays will lead appointments for this year's awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached its fifteenth place.
But the album of Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell was almost nine years old and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - true name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, laryngitis acutes forced him to cancel the concerts.
He emerged later that he had a basket on a vocal rope.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous, others only for use.
But also many veteran and resident taxi drivers for a long time find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without doing the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active road trafficked.
There's no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlantic.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-time neighbors who say they were hit by the road truncated simply because it was one of the last remnants of the noble neighborhood of the past.
But the department of preservation and development of the city, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Committee for the Use of Land of the Municipal Commission of the Surroundings, some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of the community board 3 district.
"There is very little space left to the city's property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to fix and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small road and install seats, including some to be used for a coffee to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, an Avalon Bay spokesperson, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this derelict alley and transform it into a public threat," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Preservation Accommodation, said that in fact it was the city's desire to sell the road and pointed out that the purpose of the agency was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a light historical print.
Some believe that he took his name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps better known as the cover set for the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The land was beautiful," said Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of filth, clothing brands and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about "gentrification" of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, leading to the fact that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of city almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Regrets: A little nostalgic look at the extinct city"), published part of a City History Speech that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow street without exit, dark even by day and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with the Saracines, with old newspapers of weeks flowing along the bottoms."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent night.
A rat ran agilely through the back of the street near a door that led inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic store of clothes.
There were graffiti on the walls and a 22-ounce empty beer bottle lying near a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby have said that they rarely thought about Extra Place but they suggest that they would need to be a little beautified.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member of the California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
Really attracting the Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "Afro-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these deficiencies in achieving the objectives, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in language classes other than English, does not take into account his interest in closing learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
School students are for the Spanish and low-income majority.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among the fourth grade students, one surprising 100 percent of the students did the upper level test in the 2008 math state exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth-grade students did the expert level test on English-language art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes the loophole and exercise, constant assessment of skills and a "no excuse" attitude.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We had a great success with a student who had just come from Mexico and if you had entered class 12 months later you wouldn't have been able to identify who she was."
"It works," he observed "for us it works."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools by a Spanish majority and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its continuing support for bilingual education prevent Mr. Obama's response from predicting.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama has recently made the subject trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps of achievement, he should consider carefully the educational models that work rather than despise them or trivialize them.
Oil falls sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices have fallen sharply Monday due to concerns that even the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The future of the crude fell from 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel to the New York merchant bag in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices had dropped to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before climbing again, on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety affected investors again Monday also after the congress leaders had said they had reached an agreement on the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from being passed.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will include the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenzy negotiations of the weekend had led to a rescue agreement " appear to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
While the economic situation is getting worse, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The perspective for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape contamination.
From a perspective of raw materials our most pressing concern is how far the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while household oil consumption due to slow economic growth, reducing forecasts of the price of oil and gas by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploitation in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he saw everything.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without points into a resurgence.
"Never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second fourth began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equaled the grayness of the threatening clouds that oversaw them with a faint game.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing harmony made a gigantic step forward.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't come out of my path," said Favre of all the steps that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch games, the defense hit Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The Darrelle Revis cornerback intercepted a wandering launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another passage and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens force Warner's smoke.
The last shifter, Bowens' forced smoke, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took advantage of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had resumed the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a target of 20 yards, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe his madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets granted 21 points without response in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There's been a lot of points in a little time span."
Restored Gebrselasie exceeds its record of the world
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown again because many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the race favourably flat at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sends in fritums for 27 seconds its previous score of 2:03:26, last year's course in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie developed the 26th world record of such an amazing career that produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from mile to marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie jumped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a striking average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-founders like Gebslelassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory of Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had heartburns and missed a week of workouts.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselasie said to the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at last everything went well."
He was a bit criticised - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having excessively orchestrated his races, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on apilist as if it were a mid-fund race, and placing world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the greatness of the skills of Gebrselasie as a marathon.
With the step taken by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselasie reached the halfway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held in competition Gebrselasie after the apilists disappeared.
Just over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made a final rush to separate from Kwambai, which ended in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, has completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games have been lost with what is described as a bad accident, but is cured to win in Berlin, making its best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon that ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a large detachment, taking them back after about 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the theme park extended on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendour, the noise, the enormous, lies the quiet city where pride and complications of African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black town incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as he described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that has described - and that makes tourists stop by understanding it in Florida's tourist guide produced by the Federal Depression Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is so independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, doesn't know what is going on."
Even now, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening talk on the race, many here remain distrustful of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident of the city's oldest church and a member of the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes disgruntled, sometimes awarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern about Eatonville's imagination really started with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida in a black story scene and human drama
Low as a frog in both life and literature, Hurston brought readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the street on the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishings, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always watched, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passage rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second weddings and sex.
Clearly this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said what it was like," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortalizes her quoting men singing gross songs about their beauty.
Adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric that often returned from his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalls that when Hurston plunged into the city, he usually arrived without notice in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts of dignified clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, Mr. Franklin says, while others were suffocating.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But he added, swinging on his chair on the back floor above Lake Séalia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "they never stayed for a long time."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books had gone out of print.
Together with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although he was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in a plateless grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where he had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no great conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "wrapped in Rainbows," a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-way highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 through the western boundary of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing carried hatred on the community door.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things into people sitting on one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a cook out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honour for my race".
Residents now say that the breakdown of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, erodes the cohesion of Eatonville and jeopardises the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudice, as he did, with cheerful security of himself and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the Hurston plateless tomb and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Robert E. Hemenway's Hurston struck the shelves of the booksellers, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The project of the highway arrived just as his most famous daughter had once again blocked the lights of the slope.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a lifesaver.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many come back for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its street project.
"The five tracks of the resurgence highway, they brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the idea that the city has itself.
Those from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to rival the past.
Eatonville was added to the public record in 1998.
A new one-storey bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard sheltered and beautified.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from the centre of Orlando, can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to search for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interview, to some things - such as the walls on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for bright red, still fears that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, there was also a high level of citizen pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw its entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, no worse and fair, creative, great worker, foolish and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin's grandson Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they've just come in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after the Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a nice city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from newspapers banks and from the huge TV screens of Times Square, they would not notice to be in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nestled on their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live every day the worst "bad day in the office" since the collapse of 1929.
Farmers shake metal carts for the tea through the sidewalks, transporting muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken shirts stretched on a stick on their shoulders.
The employees still wait in line for their morning bagel to the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It didn't seem there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new saving book on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order cheque books, tourists ask directions for the big Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trust banker", were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from the smaller banks from the places the pendulums make, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called Thrift (sometimes like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and, while the New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved her.
The employees and commits who were standing in front of me, scared of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a secure port, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and to his emaciated CEO Dick Full in all familiarity, as if complaining of a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the doorkeeper in uniform, almost 50 years of my condominium, has changed the subject from our normal conversation topic on Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expense.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left side of the Austrian side of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They bring signs like the road representatives mosques with a red line passing through.
The police blamed the extremists on the right for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the far right gained a lot from the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits have traced Jewish symbols like the Star of David over a few graves, but detectives believe it could have been an attempt to mask the extreme motivations led by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesperson from the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of desecration, which happened toward the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance to Muslims.
Meanwhile, Austria embarked on a spiritual search journey following its right-hand turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30% of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with vehemently anti-immigrant tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against sails and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties appear to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, leading them to be political symbols of continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses made immediately after the elections, which have established the extreme right as the nation's strongest political block, indicating that the change was carried out predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
I travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
At Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of sexual abuse of minors, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain from the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities that they were controlling him to want to go to Spain through France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent's police last Thursday after the magistrates had given evidence of Glitter's previous arrest for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, true name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford preture in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September at Ashford Preture, Kent's police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64 years old, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the register of convicted persons for sexual offences.
He must give information to the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice on his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a five-year prison sentence.
Kent's police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements in the country.
A Kent police spokesperson said, "Kent police will do everything they need to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have full systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted sexual offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10 and 11-year-olds.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have made him switch to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
At last he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge preture, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to put him in the register of convicted sexual offenders.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having had images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior felt assured and happy that Glitter had been stopped by traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor fly nor clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, at those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go to the scene.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the least known side of these masters.
To this end, the photographer offers an original flamenco iconography, taking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and makes it clear that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the road" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the public.
To catch the personality of these great ones you don't need to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the big flamenco."
With the passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at depicting singers, guitarists or dancers using a tiled camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and material, remember classical photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the artist's personality, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, have been and have been the constant of this work, in exposure these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited during the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portrait Portraits of Veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or face people, characters you don't even know or give you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concreteize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at the number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel she's writing is a "azardo"
It is set in places that do not yet know and deal with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is in the grip of a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived 20 years in Congo and has crossed the Amazon.
Ever since the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project that is currently being dealt with today "is an azardo" and that "everything indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had good sense, I would not write it, but I will do it as well and hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his intervention at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passing through the city of Acqueduct a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as a forecast, the figure of prominent to the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" book, filled the places of the theatre Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to whom time flew when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, evoked in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "read pleasure" and "live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "inspiration gap", with an intense work of documentation, writing and continuous remaking; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories stand.
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, claiming that, on the contrary, "has effects" and that "makes people more anti-conformist." That is why he invited writers to "not give in to frivolity" and to "take responsibility" for their vocation.
Time impedes the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of the races
The celebration of the races that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the tournaments selected for the races had verified that the soil conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has struck against this festival, preventing two days of celebration.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the performance of the second thor race.
Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull from Castilblanco, were on signs.
Therefore, the Festival had regular performance only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and coming out in triumph, after having toasted with taste and aesthetic.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races by receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by virtue of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, you won the fisks of most of the public.
A pickup truck with two thousand kilos of hashish past the block post in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Agents take the high to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they run away.
Agents have summoned the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping to escape.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after pursuing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., according to the statement in the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested person is accused of drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some officials on the Alava road were carrying out a transport control on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop a truck for the inspection when the driver, failing the orders, rushed sharply and passed the block.
Agents followed the chase until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped at the edge of the road and its two occupants fled to a forested area.
Ertzaintza's agents managed to arrest one of the fugitives and kidnap 2,178 kilograms of hashish that they carried and took note once the van, an Iveco Daily, was inspected.
Hashish sandwiches, which were in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since the officials found that the register had been "doubled" because it did not coincide with the one reported in the truck documentation, the arrest was also charged the crime of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as already said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
Detainee A. A. J., 28 years old, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge within the next few hours.
Arrest actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effect of medicines
actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw him perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the People magazine by a spokesperson on the California road.
The witness specified that around 16.30 the Locklear "shocked down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the car with sudden maneuvers forward and backward. Taking back, he passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first sight, saw that the Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and got out of the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"He seemed confused," and for this reason the agents led him to a specialist drug and alcohol centre to test her.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress has proved collaborative and the hypothesis of alcohol excess has been discarded from the outset, although "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some drug."
Locklear was arrested with suspicion of driving under the effect of some not better specified substance and was imprisoned in the local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, the Locklear was released from a specialized clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callazares urges the Andalusian Federation of the UI to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional training federation to make a decision on the case of the former adviser to the Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares with regard to the resolution that the party will have to adopt with regard to what has so far been an adviser to the Council in Seville.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations concerning the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI always wanted this kind of investigation to be fully transparent."
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public charges."
"Sangre de May", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci proposes in Sangre de May the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director attempted to "enlighten the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, for more than two and a half hours, debuted this Friday in the cinema halls, to become a television miniserie of more than four hours on TeleMadrid in the future.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him from the Community of Madrid three years before turning a commemorative film for the second centenary of the 2nd May South. The director had agreed that the story of basing on the novel Episodios Nationales.
The 15 million budgets allocated entirely by the Community of Madrid have represented for Garci a "one-time opportunity" to recreate the scenography and the appropriate costumes to portray a "a dull Spain that failed the choice of the leader for which to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the director regrets that he has not received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los ghosts de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the script that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of the return to begin, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the performance with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before turning with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliant," considering that "part of the director's work resides in going to theatre and cinema to know what is going on in the sector in which he works."
Many of the interpreters, part of whom enter the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate for Oscar for four times - win one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood - its Blood of May, Seven tables de billiard French and, the last selected Los girajos blind - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
From this film Garci does not expect prizes.
"At the beginning you think you work for the posters, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at some point you agree to simply spin an extra film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Swiss essence of the Ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Swiss dancer pays tribute to another Swiss dancer.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana district, and at the age of three moved with her family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the calibre of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
This woman's life, which marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this character. I thought it was incredible."
She holds the ballerina: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to gather her spirit.
His dance titles suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tanghi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing also fits into this aesthetic," he explains.
The stage includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of her shows, as she does "The Open Door"; and that of Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been her student.
"Matilde plays Adult Tortola, the character of maturity.
I am happy that you agreed to work in my work and that is what I feel very honored."
The set also includes musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi di Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the violet of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been turned round, and who have always had many spasms."
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole of Europe, because she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it, because I think it was one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now nobody remembers it and much less considers its operation as something of value" Bayon said.
The show will start today, at 20.30 at the theatre of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poete newly married" the Triennio is also closed
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poet Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Councillorate for Culture of the Union of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature and that of the death of both.
Thus, the "Trennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-issue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Councillorate for Culture of the Junta of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poet Reciencasado", by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the spread of the figure and the work of one of the highest-value Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The sentence is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the disturbing idea that Newman left.
Yet it cost him a lot to deliver an Oscar.
And since 2007 he was retired.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on earth, in the desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and there are many people to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone it embodied the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the first overdose death to the creation of the brand of home and biological food.
All gifts to a country where it took a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without taking care of nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, observed that a man didn't die, that was a time.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, a director awarded Oscar, said that working with Newman constituted nothing less than the apex of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, managed to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a very high level for all of us," noted George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for rectitude and to have a serious and distant private life on cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some prove it to us and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he certainly lacked the opportunity not to be.
"Why am I going to eat outside burgers today, if I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Among all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as the devoted husband, loving father, eager and passionate grandfathers," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we were to follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my view it was by far the worst thing I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if later were to be taken into account in the evaluation and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the removal of the backbone, which assumed that it would go first.
It didn't seem like a wrong idea, but if they force you to go, that it is to withdraw everything (including chip to avoid codes during the race).
Not at all.
You just had to go to take the backbone (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they had only size 'S' shirts (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inequal about the same day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon to take the chip, the waiting tail was 15 minutes and, more importantly, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasts more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as was foreseeable, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once successful in the company, recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the expectation of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion were added and assaulted to the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have the pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the classification in correct order because of the chip which, I suppose, did not correctly register the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will certainly not enter into my thoughts.
So I think we're gonna keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft searches for receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move into the company campus) assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen to and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the video for example the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that it does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of society.
She asks if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at her disposal shortly.
Everything without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a strategy change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found out that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less charged with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change in direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You only take your computer to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and we spend more time every day browsing the network than in a remote window environment.
What is half the operating system's applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services into a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, indeed, and I bring here a small example.
I took the picture inserted in this post in one of Microsoft's employees' recreation venues in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the beverage machine a sign encourages them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to perform an online search.
Last week, moreover, the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the mobile phone is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was carrying her on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was shining in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de Blood', as well as Al Pacino ne 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola as well as being part of the typical uniform of the gay muscular parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the forcible with the pointed stick that lifts the weights in the walking circus.
In essence, this is the typical man-made shirt, with the interior of cotton, tied and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, though, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands above all.
The "Marcel" is excellent compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive theme and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), that the most iconic models of the shirt carry as details on the neck.
The "Marcel" is excellent compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive theme and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), that the most iconic shirt models carry as details on the neck.
And pay attention, because the production of the Belgian company is not only about the famous "tank".
Includes also college sweatshirts, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, marinara shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great similarity with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new activities in the field of fashion very seriously.
For Monica, I am much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the signature Mango made of its new headquarters, as well as the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, quickly conquers you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the fall-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the '50s is '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to lose myself in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it frequently.
Ballerina, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even though in the end, everything comes together and there are many elements in common.
I, as a child, liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to fray in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I've always paid a lot of attention to the dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to the essays, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they deliver you the wardrobe is the moment you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you were 30 years old, you got into a crisis?
But no.
I never felt better. I like the idea of 30.
I find that at that age women are mature and have good experience to taste life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're gonna be a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because my own body asks me and I also want to be a young mother, that I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do will bring great happiness to my son and educate him with great love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you're waiting for some films to be filmed in the different rooms last year.
That's right, and I really want them to sit down.
As a woman who comes from the theatre, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be so.
I want you to go "The Last Hour" and "In search of the tomb of Christ".
Let's see if you'll like it
A few days ago you debuted on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like you were on the bridge as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, called me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Done for a better world" and the clothes we've exhibited – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
They say so many things about her, that I who have known her for a long time can confirm that they are not so true.
In addition, I find this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to do the pine, I would have done the same.
If it's to help the women of the third world, you can't pull back.
Alcoholic relapse drivers will have to install "alcohol"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, to install in their car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of drunkenness or if it does not blow up the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Attorney-General's Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to attend a road rehabilitation course.
This initiative, in addition to the Public Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, will participate in the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Istituto Tecnologico per la Seguridad dell'Automobile (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of reported motorists reported more than once per driving in a state of drunkenness then return to driving the car.
Alcohol will avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the breathed air and prevents the driver from setting up the car if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than the permitted one.
The cost is higher than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices allow for a reduction of up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out on a regular basis, and, no doubt, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the PSOE which proposes to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, second programme, the Spanish aircraft in which the Asturias principles were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was rising but the rays still forced the hand to be visor to see the real couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish principles were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you've lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 marine soldiers offering honorary greetings.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, a wind chisel, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps told her that in Mexico City she threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing into the room where they are expected by the official board.
At the hotel door where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, they are expected by a spirit reporter of Mexican television.
The best award offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, not Paris and probably no more exquisite designer and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in the Mango window at number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept from the emotion.
On the other hand, it is the second largest firm in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire for pleasure to the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite canvases, the gala presidential table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Born, with his broken heart and making necessity virtues, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a house dress and some complements of ELAH to take away the breath and arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters tall - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the dinner of homage.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of the house and the knight who finished, along with the Baron Rotchil, without the jacket, because they had both surrendered them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirt – designed by her hand – turned for dinner, wearing a long black very sensual dress and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the ballroom and she, recalling other times, grabbed a bar and outlined a "big fold".
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk in the premises of the palace, but had first shown us his son's photos on his cell phone.
The next day we were pleased with the presence of Olivier Martinez – another young man who moved on the bike – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously ensured that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the number antistress
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to libraries on September 30.
Awakening is almost a punishment when it squirms every morning at 7, but it is even worse to imagine itself involved in the frenetic rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's backache.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there is neither one nor two methods to fight daily exhaustion and fatigue to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number is nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of his book, a whole "menu" of custom-made options for each person's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in such areas as work or personal relationships, this "manual" denies such conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not already flow into your veins to find the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off the mind and focus on reading.
Talking in the sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very excited to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who speak while sleeping.
The first time it happens, at most it takes a scare, but actually it doesn't matter very much.
This is a benign alteration of the sleep defined dreamword.
It manifests with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you told me you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, nocturnal enuresis (do pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it is still a little studied phenomenon.
Even the intensity with which it appears to be extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (screams, screams, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to see if there is any question that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a way out of the situation.
We said that this is a benign alteration therefore there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress situation).
What can be done instead is to consider a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before he goes to sleep.
Offer quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for which it is difficult to relax, relaxing techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sleepwalkers appear to try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you will interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you appear very distressed and episodes have a certain frequency, you should consult a doctor or check where your child is experiencing such anxiety.
If you understand what it says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into temptation to interrogate him for information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep and so unconscious to organize his thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not see what he is dreaming to say, so you must pay very much attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which they might lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even for jokes.
Something like this causes enormous anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that just takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory at home after a long period of fruitless.
Without playing a formidable game, the Giallo-neri have created the largest number of network opportunities by transforming one into the win of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers expressed themselves in difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the guest team Kauffmann who went through the seven with a long shot, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from the distance, then Hirn tall, Romain tip and Diebold again.
Dannemarie responded with a block in the middle of the camp, leaving only the trigger Riahi at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed by Riahi and Temporal for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the well positioned Illhaeusern, he resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the cannonman of the Illhaeusern will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later thus leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie won't be able to take advantage of it and won't put great problems to the eleven of the Illhaeusern, just set aside to "enforce" the defense, except in the last few minutes of play when, after a rocambolesque action, the ball crossed the cross.
Sarkozy meets the angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Brittany.
Before the demonstration of the fishermen who brutally prevented access to several ports of Breton and Normandy on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning, in the department of Finistère, to enchant its representatives.
The latter promised to accept it "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "they will present themselves with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by Breton fishermen in order to take measures to deal with the price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's spokesperson, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and ensure the working conditions and remuneration of sailors".
The fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "lumak operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of swallowing.
Also the port of Quiberon has been blocked, but connections with Belle-Island have not been stopped.
On the Quiberon peninsula a road block has been implemented.
On Monday the sailors have already proved their determination by burning, starting at dawn, tires and pallets in front of fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking up demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and of the Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the vessels remained at the dock, or in Havre, where some twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the block of the total refinery of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday in the ministry to decide any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "Crission Committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting planned for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" as "the fishermen will not yield" and "they will not intend to move to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fuel taxes, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the limit of a vessel's yield will only be reached with a diesel less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of Butch Cassidy died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes praised the film legend and actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the threat of recession on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth global company in the sector, maintains the delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company trusts widely in the Chinese market, in particular for the planes of the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered in eight years 41 aircraft to Chinese customers.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, which was set up by the US monetary authorities, would transfer more than 15% of its activities in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the transfer of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, it specifies the paper on the basis of sources more than authoritative.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evenings to consider any shipments, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
The activities that the AIG intends to divest include the branch of air leasing International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No definitive decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the 85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities impose 80% of its capital.
Paris: Morning Meeting History
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against the Paulson plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10,365.45, below 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) was higher than that of 17 September 2001, when the stock exchanges were reopened following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, the index of the main technology titles, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, depending on the definitive closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, designed to bring stability back to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives refused the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two republicans out of three refused the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market counts on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it could already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would be passed quickly to the Fed – Federal Reserve- (the American Central Bank, ndr) and to the other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, head of the finance and economic sector at the Global Insight.
And still highlighting the state of emergency," every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, said the Piegza.
After the failure of the Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the banking activities of Wachovia by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has sped up sharply, calling for urgent action in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, signal that the markets "are not only in the face of an American crisis but in the face of a global crisis", added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The return of the Treasure Goods with a maturity of 10 years is reduced to 3.632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday evening, while the return of the Treasury Goods with a maturity of 30 years is 4.161%, against 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama in favour of the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the Republican and Democratic Campaign proclaimed their respective victory for the television duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to stop the down in the five-week polls from the presidential.
The Gallup Institute, of which a poll published on Saturday gives a five-point advantage to Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of indecisive voters, found that 39% of them considered Obama the winner, while 25% pointed to McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's advantage on Thursday.
"Underestimating it would be a mistake.
It has a good sense", however Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "ingenuity" of the opponent regarding the arguments faced during the first face-to-face.
"St. Obama doesn't seem to understand that." he often said to multiple shots.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president," he said.
What has been an ongoing target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without delay, it has proved concise and precise.
It has promoted its predisposition to the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama," he said, this weekend, a democratic spot, renouncing the republican that he had not taken the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, he denounced Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under heavy rain, for an election meeting.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial crisis is in favour of Obama, regarded by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the cliff.
"The next week could be a decisive turning point," he considered, yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intention to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's findings, the Senator of Illinois also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
Carefully, the two candidates dodged the questions focused on the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday evening the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice the elections?"
Young people and opponents manifested on Sunday evenings in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge in advance the results of the legislatures.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evenings immediately after the closure of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignations".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "What pro? They will do as they please, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that that regime that has made a good impression of foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by the observers.
They didn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been separated from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the stripping of votes," Iuri Potemkine, spokesperson for the Union of the Democratic Forces, complained, a mixed alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a façade change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections and head of the pro-European movement, since the important one is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If Members of the opposition come into Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt with Russia, gets into crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the ballot.
It stresses that participation quotas seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has given rise to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there were elections? asks social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the election seats.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, the most convenient in power."
Night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission were pleased with their success.
The meeting - The blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice because Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, it has regained the confidence of the public, seriously shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national reserves of blood managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to highlight the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was delaying writing a report, some provinces have set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, just 38% of people said they still believed in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the next few years, we have regained the confidence of the public," he explained before proudly saying that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, told by those who had been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know at all whether that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
Therefore, one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports has been based on one of the main recommendations, according to which, when one has doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
Now, for some years, it has been shown that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted by infected blood.
This episode has shown us that it has made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the tests of nucleic acid (TAN) that allow the presence of the virus and not of antibodies against the virus directly in the blood of donors, on which the tests used so far were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, since the person contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be identified in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not being able to identify them is thus greatly diminished.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will need to be distributed before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples every year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV is found transmitted with a transfusion.
I believe that you can feel calm today when you receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover your health, says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in blood by an insect.
We need to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that, in addition to having secure resources, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
"Necessity increases as the population grows older.
Since treatment against cancer is more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences on the number of donors who on average constitute only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who have reached the age of 18 years and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is spread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
The cases of shortage are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they grow old and cannot make donations anymore.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but especially to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so frenetic that it is hardly an hour to donate blood," says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eyeball heart valves and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with the Hema-Québec that manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abundant blood rich in stem cells that can help cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the entry into the bank of our thousandth blood sample of cordon and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
You should start to propose them for transplants at the beginning of next year," said Dr. Décary who describes this practice of taking cordon blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't have access to you," because Héma-Québec has no means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Calcium - The semi-final impact
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final of the A series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive game of the quarter final, at Saputo Stadium.
Centrocampista Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first time without goal from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino marked the subsequent networks for the Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Let's remember that at the first game of the return trip, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-final.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunderler completed a first 3-1 in the return match by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will have to deal with the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In brief - decisive network of Kovalev
The Canadian and its axes are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive game phase by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, marked a goal, made two steps, and picked up a passage for victory, in the fourth of the Hab's preparatory games.
Decided for victory the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, said Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to strangle in the first period, he noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation."
Charest tip north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the start of elections before the end of the year.
After concluding the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon yesterday, in Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to be elected during today's partial elections.
"Enlarge the borders of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday to Levis, through instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "picture mill".
On three maxi screens, they were confused with spectacular negative hydroelectric dams, mining, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in the full election campaign.
During the press conference, however, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, even though he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - was never the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has just explained why the North would be "a jewel with immense potential", but he has not spoken about timing or investment shares, as he has not explained exactly what will be the priorities in the implementation of future projects.
At the most, it was limited to reporting what it saw as a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, which, as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure, has undergone several improvements.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "great territory twice as much as France" is here, it is Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he is insisted on us," he insisted, as if he wanted to solicit a national myth founder.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditionally maintained position by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity is presented, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "in view of climate change, we must reevaluate the North," he said, speaking of the passage of the north-west, which will be open throughout the year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty."
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the Ungava PQ), have already initiated the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) is an important position, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "they will provide common visions"
The development of the North would also adhere to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, ordered and respected by the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the first Liberal ministers who preceded it.
"As the Liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage that nationalized hydroelectricity, to Borassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another reference, conservative this time, was made to John Diefenbaker's "Street towards the North" programme, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Faced with the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest stated that its deployment would be planned for 2012.
"All that remains among us, but I feel that we will do so," he confessed to his militants, raising his applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not miss the opportunity to start a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
She stressed that she was certainly very busy, particularly in a mission of the federal council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leadership with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that passed smooth like oil: the PLQ calls above all for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the Northern Plan outline was accepted in a skeptic way.
PQ leader Pauline Marois re-polluted the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
In your opinion, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had, "we would have made progress today," commented Marois alongside Jean-Talon's candidate (scrutinium today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADA has declared supporting the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope for, is that all of this is not simply perceived as a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, substitute for Mario Dumont, who is coming back today from the holiday.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (the irony of fate) of the Harper cabinet, to allow himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "disgrace" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says so much about the prime minister's entourage, or Stephen Harper himself.
This is before a government which is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that it has not returned one of its citizens detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account at all the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time when the facts charged to him happened.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child soldier in inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the defendant's guilt.
We recall, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, invoke Omar Khadraffin's return so that he can undergo a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely the same government that closes its eyes before torture: it does little to them that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of oppression.
We do not yet realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of freedom and of "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop showing and that sounds so foolish on his lips.
Here we have arrived at the moment when there is no more morals: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today a minority (to see what will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame is right here, Mr. Toews, in renouncing all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In September 17, Le Devour published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a defamation complaint of six million against three authors and a small publisher house broken down with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a defamation dispute, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring ruin to anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own.
Little matter the outcome of the process, the writers and the editor of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a large amount of money in order to organize their defense and fight, to decidedly learnt weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by virtually no fund pockets of the mining company.
On the other hand, in these struggles with odd weapons, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that invades the opposition as well as scare everyone else to decide again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is first of all the public opinion that she should have presented her own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates usually take place with the exchange of views rather than with manganello blows.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, its documents, and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of teams of independent researchers who could have shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is quite obvious?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word indicates only profusely paid lawyers and not the whole of Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Nero does it first because it rejects the brutal means taken by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the view of what many perceive as a kind of embalming (requiring the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Nero an ultimatum urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the complaint brought by Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to quote authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss matters that are uncomfortable to the richest businesses in the world, a lot of complaints are worth, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do it by following scientific standards as the authors of Canada Black do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to his claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the university world, as is the same public debate in Canada, and it is now the time for governments to take measures that can limit abusive complaints.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the heads of Congress, representatives of the republican and democratic forces, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest saving plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion US dollar plan, which aims to curb the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by the two Congress Chambers.
It provides in particular: checks on its actual implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of cases that are not paid, as well as a right of inspection on remuneration paid to the directors of the protected companies.
US Secretary to Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street."
"It is the crucial point: if we had not acted in this way, inestimable inconveniences and troubles would have been poured out on the everyday lives of the Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The deadline for opening the markets was agreed this morning.
The two candidates for the US presidency were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not want to express their discontent before adopting extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama is worthy of having added some provisions to the agreement, in particular that which will enable the owners to maintain their home and that related to wages for the managers of companies covered by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice at.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he's going to vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"As I read, it's something that we all need to digest and that will allow us to move on"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to re-purchase with taxpayers' money the doubts, risky and unsaleable assets of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble which led first to the collapse of mortgages at risk (many) , and then to extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and lead to the freezing of liquidity and the abandonment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge who blew up the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have come out of that blind alley since the democrats accepted that the active "toxic" of some companies in difficulty was only protected by the government rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone at Congress, a provision was added that, if the government were to face losses over the five years to come because of this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to be added to if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In return for your help, Washington will obtain participation shares in protected companies that will divide it in the event of profit and that it will be able to resell when the waters calm down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the lending procedures relating to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and departure allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
From today onwards, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that they are given free passage to their plan.
In fact yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the republican and democratic forces.
"Of course, Washington does not hear you," he declared speaking to his constituents, Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Chamber's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But certainly not taking advantage of taxpayers..
Leader of a small group at the so-called "the caucus of skeptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to tell us : we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and carefully examine the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would have given up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) for the crisis of venture real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is one of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It is not of the lost money," said the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, there is influence and right to vote in banking matters.
It's certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that times are announcing uncertainty"
During this period, at the other end of the Manica, the British government seems to be nationalising another bank in bile for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would be responsible for all the loans currently under way at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than $41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that you will be buying the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was for a long time its ace in the sleeve, for others its weak spot.
Was he freed from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the sick smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and the obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
What a constant!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in recent years.
Less monumental than Brando, to which he resembled and of which he was long a kind of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Magical children are often born from mixed couples.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, last brand of quality.
Since in him was recognized as a whole country seized of the safe made man, of the combatant of the Pacific war, proud in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, on television and soon in cinema.
That same militant man for civil rights was also the motor driver who ranked himself according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
If you leave with him the shadow areas of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which you will never be able to reveal the mystery completely.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a dive to the heart for cinephiles, while his great characters pop the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is re-proposed through its interpretations.
The fascinating cowboy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy unable to desire the hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La catta on the roof that hatched adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958 are confused in memory.
More recently, we remember him in the cloths of the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep as promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone through history.
The Gratian Rocky Boxer, a criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lassu, someone loves me, Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, who officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute evil in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as best film in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive billiard player in Lo Spaccone, Robert Rossen's magnificent film (1961), Martin Scorsese's money color, which earned him the only oscar on 9 appointments in 1987.
That face through the years, it was hers.
Still him.
Epochs happen through their path.
Young people know him especially for George Roy Hill's Slap Shot-Drying cult movie (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, Coen's brothers.
The circle was closed with a final role as godfather of the Irish Mafia in my father's age in 2003.
Unlike the most popular cinema legends that soon abandoned the craft, Newman will stay in the halls, denouncing Hollywood throughout his outfit, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined him, with an irony point, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging his performance exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholized carrots or desperate, of which he expressed contempt and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pure sensitivity.
The first time Jennifer, of 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, drew a subtle portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost Scott's son for an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes rained on Newman yesterday, his great friend and old companion of weapons Robert Redford (they had acted together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness" His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, is thus turned off.
We will have strung her face out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, although born as gag.
However, the revenue from those sales was intended for its Foundation for Children in difficulty.
Newman, instead of clinging to his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being here was a privilege."
And the same privilege was for us to follow the path of such a clean and generous American artist.
Citizen model, therefore, and much more.
What has been produced in the Zuschlag & partners invoice factory?
In the near future, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and its members will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from contest notices was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of the activities through false invoices.
State and municipal money, a total of 65 million guilders, has ended partly in the cassettes of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, reported by the investigating authorities, they have taken the money obtained from competition notices on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
In order to do so, the invoice blocks were purchased in the Józsefváros market, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on which companies to issue the invoices, it was established among others during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for consumption, on the model of these were then prepared the invoices to be submitted to competition calls, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the City of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András ., who, according to our information, has drawn up above all the reports needed to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "travel studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and members in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
So many people, however, according to the restorator, would not all go into the room together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 at the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, subsequently called Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, a bundle of formal and content errors.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, however in the invoice there were 130 guests.
But the compilators of the invoices full of fantasy have exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., this also deals with catering, in whose accounts - according to the information given to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, company administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecution and showed him the invoices, he realized that these were false documents.
"On stamp the name and Iva match of our company were at the wrong place."
He added: In addition to formal reasons, there was not even a return to the fact that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
The invoice was for catering and their restaurant was no longer in operation for some time.
The invoice compilers did not worry to inform themselves that the travel agency in Budapest of their choice, organizes only trips abroad, so they suddenly indicated on the invoice with cash payments in travel to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
Moreover, as shown during the investigation, VAT was also included in the invoice, while travel activities to countries outside the European Union are exempt from VAT.
Moreover, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it was necessary to apply VAT to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition to the employees of the hotel issued only printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured was handwritten.
In addition to this, "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as activities carried out by road freight, as is known from the Procura proceedings, activities not carried out by the company founded originally for investment advice.
Moreover for formal defects - cause non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it has been discovered that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers have not even paid attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) had eaten you a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, precisely for this reason the company's liquidator, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They have sent invoices knowingly
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The foundation Exély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták in favor of the foundation Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million guilders.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictional invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and members also the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for about 5 million guilders to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even money movement because the invoices prepared were then stolen, but associations forgot to make this part of their documents appear.
In the following group of invoice issuers belong to those who are connected with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to contact the Director General of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not found there, who deals with fuel trade and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million guilders.
According to the investigation data, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The Director-General of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov would forward the company's documents between 2002 and 2005.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian Muratories founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received a job.
However, the companies made it useful because, at the request of the co-employed lawyer Zsolt Szente, the editor of the company's founding documents, invoices have been issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov released to the various companies 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million guilders.
The prosecutor considers that Kubatov has inflated 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictional invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition notice.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a ban for the Socialist Party's public utility agency, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
In order not to come to the branch, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the Árpad Kemecsei office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing a part of the defendants, as they have already done, will probably report on the production of invoices.
However the most interesting thing could be if defendant number one, János Zuschlag, decided to raise the veil on everything.
His confession has not been very detailed so far and although he has promised several times to talk about it in a broad way, he has not yet done so.
It is necessary to see if it is in your interest, that Socialists may also have made agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million guilders, much of the damage - would be willing to make the goat scapegoat.
Zuschlag could also be offended by the fact that his demands to alleviate his prison conditions, that is, the granting of house arrests, have so far not been heard.
While the perpetrators of commercial offences cannot be compensated and cause much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of auctioning in excess: why spend more money?
At auctions buyers are likely to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and researchers at the University of New York managed to discover the neuro-economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study on Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a race like eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
Research has tried to trace the nervous scheme of this "game" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players took part in a auction while using the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body slammed under the cerebral cortex gets intensively into function when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "autogratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the price rise is explained by scanning the vehemently reaction of the strata body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group carried out a financial follow-up investigation.
In this investigation three groups have tendered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported how much the actual value of the product concerned was and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they promised that in the case of winning they will receive another $15 prize.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost their money in case of auction loss.
The difference between the two groups consisted of the fact that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
Testing the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group playing "against loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "winner".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These so far explained the phenomena that can be found at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to talk to your doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, in Hungary instead of among the first causes of death, chronic liver diseases are mentioned.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients is 100 thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruses and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
For those travelling it is useful to vaccinate against virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two-three weeks after the consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish stains are formed on the skin and white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and dark urine, healing occurs within two-three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver tumors and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one person in ten receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical analyses.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals the disease, it is worth addressing your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is cureable, the virus can be eliminated by the body, thus the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by associations of sick people.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent survey religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The scientists at Oxford University performed an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
Within the framework of some bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while all those who observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the University are also involved.
The test was done exactly this way: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock has been connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the hermelline by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the virgin Mary would originate a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because it did not differ too much from each other and considered it to be of calming effect.
The experimenters spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time ring received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious or the other painting.
Catholics reported that the vision of the virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care" of them and "they calmed down and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious theme image they realized 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image from the strong effect even for atheists, however, you must find the appropriate image.
"We must look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - added Wright.
After the excellent results, only the question remains if the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of such a caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself
On the tenth birthday Google can claim to be both in people's pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; he knows where they spent their holidays, what outpatient clinic they attend and what interests him.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, is not enough yet.
What is more about skeptics who compare with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see exactly the substance of web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as many personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders that it was: "We insert into a system all the information in the world!".
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: would he like to know if Google could answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would work be suitable for me?", but software can't answer seemingly simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their internet searches exactly what words they are looking for, which IP address they are looking for, and which page will stop those interested after the search.
By means of the Custom Search started two years ago users can store their browsing history, they can concern what they have searched and clicked, then in a long time they will generate much better results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our previously declared preferences and registered.
What happens if my data is used against me, if you look at what I care about? - Google's data monopolies are asked.
In most cases the counter-reactions of the internet users are caused by the fear of the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even the rebellion to power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in reasoned cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of individuals.
The most striking example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against Brazil's pedophiles, in which Google has forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that has made possible the identification of the pedophiles from the page of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
The internet users concerned about personal rights instead suffered relief in May when the firm - in agreement with the EFF legal protection association - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: even then Google cannot be forced with any point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government has successfully ripped up nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search expressions obtained in connection with the confirmation of the child protection law approved years before, but it has failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data are Google because they believe that in this way their inner sphere and private life will be affected by starting to use their services and rise with the rebellion of the multinationals who stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of fans, activists and computer users appearing in many countries see in them the future generation of large companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as conqueror of the world because of Windows, as they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code kept always updated and the program package is much more accessible, young and cooler than the official practice of the software glue.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal and internet rights, which implies just one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
The web 2.0 only talks about collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communicative channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young media can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists its musical tastes, all of them can insert them into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which your most recent photo galleries automatically appear stored on Flickr or on Picasa.
In the meantime, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common circle of friends, comes to know easily with those who spent the night his fiendy boyfriend or a firm can fire an employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the business summit: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now has completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make it possible to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that lies behind the behavior of young people.
Who instead wants to hide something or just wants to avoid Google's monopoly can do it (for example, starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time does not leave any traces voluntarily).
There are not few people who do not register on behalf of community pages to be found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best existing profile so far.
Public opinion even waits so secretly for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten advertising agencies' revenues, record time services instead cause major malware not only to Microsoft but also to many software development companies.
However, critical observers next to all this find alarming points: the business summit, for example, has completely refused the protest of employees after having doubled the right of company asylum, has considered it too expensive the repeated catering to everyday pleasure of employees, but this decreases in front of the fact that in 2006 Google has channelled the head to the Chinese government and in accordance with their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years will move the world to one point: while some believe that Google's draft of scanning and archiving books and magazines will assume such proportions that the firm will soon find itself in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a given genetic base can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled story of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be alarmed.
Two minors helped Ózd's double homicide to clear the tracks
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd, who were duly suspected of having helped to remove the traces of the crime - said Tuesday the spokesperson of the Borsod Region Police Survey.
Young people have recognized the crime they are charged with, they are currently being accused of favor.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on a free foot.
Favoration is punishable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old man in the place, was placed in pretrial detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of premeditated murder for profit.
From the survey it turned out that the twenty-three-year-old had a big debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to pay off the debt, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a yard in Ózd where he and his 9-year-old daughter killed him.
According to MTI's information the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the list of shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the Polish state which intends to sell in a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial daily E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have presented an offer.
Petr Koblic, Director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all those interested in the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities will be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Finance Country with an almost 25% share, followed by the Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second September 11th".
The global financial disaster has occurred thanks to the American President - he accuses La Repubblica - who has not been able to compact his party behind a rapidly drunk law, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as Superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second September 11th.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the edge of the bargain.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and this will suffer later all the world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress's vote, there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation of the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to escape the threat - mention Geneva's Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still offer a lifesaver to financial institutions and taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then they will no longer be sufficient either the financial means or new unexpected solutions.
In the long term it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on broken financial markets.
Only on Monday, the weakened financial institutions have obtained more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Vienna Der Standard, according to which more and more real anxieties appear that European taxpayers, like the Americans, will have to put their hands on their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has not so far been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
"Savers" should not immediately dissipate the EUR 100 billion, however it would be better if they were to determine in which case taxpayers' money should be involved in preventing greater damage.
The intelligent machine imitates the flight of the calabron
What could be the best way to develop anti-collarization technologies if you do not imitate the sensors of the obstacles that are in nature?
Like bees.
In the amazing project presented to CEATEC in Japan, calabrons gave the initial strategic insight to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo the Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotized mini-auto provided with the properties of bees, with the ultimate purpose of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really resembles our protective shield - explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development.
Important is the role of the view of the bee, capable of a display of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers have attracted the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the ape view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that turns it immediately into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the ape, immediately changes direction turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, is carried out in a completely instinctive way.
"If it weren't for the robot car, he wouldn't be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot auto project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful and more internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what ape does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in an eyebeat.
But unlike bees, deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of wheel steerability.
Thus, instead of the endless possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, lighter and with a high energy density, which means that their duration is higher than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, it is important that the instangency of the intelligent reaction, not data processing or even less the ability to store it.
This robot must process some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so use only a few tens of Kb memory.
There's no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions which, they foresee at Nissan, can be installed in 10 years' time on serial vehicles.
Further application possibilities can be represented by unification with GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding obstacles on the road leads to destination.
They also found the child's very expensive name.
The written version of the cost-saving law of $700 billion for the purchase of disproportionate credits has been drafted, to be applied in several parts.
In the first passage half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements protracted until midnight on Saturday according to the Eastern Coast schedule, Congress leaders decided the 700 billion dollar rescue plan after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have taken serious steps forward - said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the House of American Representatives that it was only left to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The Treasury Minister Henry Paulson speaking of the result of the compromise said: the program will work and will be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, it is not about the rescue of Wall Street but about the investment of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 o'clock in Washington (2 p.m. Monday after the time of Central Europe), but did not bring about a great increase in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft defined 2008 Economic Stabilization Act concerning the program, after it will be in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, then welcomed with joy to the White House the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the original Bush administration proposal, which provided that the $700 billion would be spent all on the purchase of securities with credits disproportionate to the back.
Now as a first step you will be able to spend as much as half the amount of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of Congress, with these the Treasury Ministry will purchase securities with credits disproportionately behind, of the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the program to which the President of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the law, the Ministry of the Treasury may apply a combined tactic: it may at the same time buy credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "venened" claims.
The purchase may take place through auctions and directly - have announced the competent Ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Treasury Ministry guarantees the means of concern, for which companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damage.
Henz Paulson said: The law gives the necessary means to ensure that 700 billion dollars are due to the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial resources, their insurance or to avoid the risk of a large financial institution collapse.
We will take all the necessary steps to get us ready to introduce the law just signed - it has added.
Bank managers in crisis and waiting for state aid believe instead that the government will limit their goodwill, defined by the overseas slang simply as gold parachute.
Limitations of payments will only occur in some cases, as well as limitations depend on how the Treasury Ministry will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry acquires under a auction, it will impose an overcrowding on the gold parachute, if they do not retire the deceased bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not exaggerated.
This should be added that the existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of general administrators - the measure was commented by democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee responsible for the financial services of the Chamber of Representatives.
In addition, the State has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also gain if the economy, and with it the bank saved, will get back up.
The bill includes that in the next five years, the President must submit to the Congress a proposal providing how to repay taxpayers with the expected losses arising from the financial sector.
Of course, both sides have expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, not to defend taxpayers' dollars - the Republican deputy of California Darrell Issa has said.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by them who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The prices of paper production, editorial and typographical activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the field of electricity supply, gas, steam and water prices increased in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas made by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, given the domestic sales of the manufacturing industry, higher increases in the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of products resulting from the manufacture of metals, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco represented a decisive weight.
A decrease in prices occurred in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz saw the possibility that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement could enter into force on 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion, "it now depends on the fact that seutreocean is built in time the electronic system of entry and control".
However, he drew attention to the fact that there will no longer be entry permits in the new system, but prior to departure tourists will have to be registered.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington from now on.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will deliver the medal of the Order Cross of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, have assured their support for the government plan of $700 billion for bank rescue, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
Congress and administration representatives after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement of principle on bank rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market release package have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suited to getting the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls on the economic agenda Obama has again recovered some advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Vice President of Sarah Palin, has dispersed.
Obama in a speech to Detroit expressed the hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion bill on the floor.
He stressed that the proposal contains those steps of consumer protection which were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let himself get away with defining McCain's economic ideas.
McCain in an interview with the ABC explained that "all who are going to send down this situation with difficulty (...) but not doing anything is a way to go".
The Republican senator reported that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no merit in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill by Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole on the right is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more aware - so analyze Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article Bavarian Revolution devours his parents analyze the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU has already begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
Christian-socials have modernized Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but a process ended on Sunday that exactly ten years ago was feasible: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU fell to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 still during the period of so much mentioned Stoiber.
The reason for this is the modernization carried out accordingly in the region, which devours parents.
Sociologists have already predicted it 40 years ago, but they have been very wrong about time. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the electors to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing possibilities and the political consequences are clear.
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more aware, critical, obstinate.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the CSU has separated itself from the classic bourgeois groups: the free professionals, the artisans, the diplomats and the graduates.
Support for the CSU has fallen below 40% here.
Die Presse (depresse.com)
The viennese conservative newspaper "Who to whom?" In the article "The party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" it deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created after the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the intervention of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections were made, now rotates everything around the coalition; in the debate broadcast by the public TV party leaders just showed the cards.
Werner Faymann president of SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to deal with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left the matter open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of ÖVP, as Vice-Canceller.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course has been rejected in any case.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer has responded prudently to red offerings.
As you said, collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to get involved in ÖVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition it is still open in the party, the issues should be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ has repeated to be open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume responsibility for ruling," said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, organised this year by France having the Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of Parliament Fidesz of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenary as the principal rapporteur of the congress, drew attention to the school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and to get the most serious obstacle to their assertion.
Mr Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla, responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Governments, European social partners and representatives of major civil European organisations and equal opportunities rights were invited to the conference.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP parliamentary group, pointed out, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, that Roma are expelled from the labour market in the first place because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have an average degree of study and as a result of elementary education of bad quality only an irrelevant number of them can reach a higher degree."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these connections more widely known in the area of Roma and non-Rom.
As soon as the school starts a Roma, its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market grow all the more; through taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the Union's purpose and action is necessary to speed up the processes of school separation and therefore it is of fundamental importance that the proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be respected.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, Roma children must be given the opportunities given by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens in full respect of the future of Europe," Járóka asked.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised each year, of the Berlin meeting last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at both national and European levels.
CSU: Mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the packaged couple Huber-Beckstein will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat, the heads have not yet fallen, at the summits of the Bavarian CSU have for the moment been postponed the discussion of personal issues.
The president of the party Erwin Huber and the regional governor Günther Beckstein remain in their place, the question is until mercy lasts.
The fate of the tandem that has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary convention of the party on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the two highly criticised politicians indicated that they were not attacked with all the forces in the chair.
They have so tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the basis that one day after the "Bavarian Tusunami" they claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under Edmund Stoiber's leadership at the end of his career, the Christian-Social Union obtained 60.7%, but now after the coup d'état against Stoiber fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to coerce in any way.
As the first signal of the reorganisation within the party the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP Liberals and with the Free Electors exponents right-wing values for any government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Free Electors, that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman without regard to the great ambitions.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also play an active role, which has so far been cast into the shadow. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would deserve more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the Bundestag elections fixed for September 2009 unless the CSU will be re-established with common forces, which has played a decisive role in the national victory of 2005.
According to Merkel, that does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect the great Berlin coalition.
This is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, the crisis of social democrats still lasts.
The SPD has reached its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after the elections on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability guaranteed in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead explains with the drafts made in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has not been opposed for more than a decade, prior to yesterday's elections the opposition collected under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional change to the 2006 elections held under circumstances discussed, "has granted" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus given up a boycott previously evaluated.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russian gas pipelines to Beltransgaz across the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter for the Belarusian political situation considered to be anti-democratic.
He referred to a distancing that the OSCE, by assessing the election campaign, placed the emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on presenting itself for a third of the opposition candidates.
The OSCE's rapid Monday report, however, also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the count of votes.
Despite this opposition, an improvement in the political climate is perceived: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared to a small comparison with Moscow and continues to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers the two countries as independent for a month.
We have made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - he said to our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the opposition to the 2006 elections, it is desirable that he remain despite the fact that "power was afraid to bring even one opponent into a weightless Parliament".
The opposition does not include protest actions for the results, but rather tries to bring the message of the need for economic reforms to the voters.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, the distribution of local authorities raises difficulties, but I also see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that even the most officially aided nation, that of pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime to be adequate, which considers its main result the creation of social security.
Because of the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time that the breakdown of social security "reminds the sepulcral silence" - Milinkevich believes.
Contrary to the opposition policy, the Russian observers have judged the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, President of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were rotating doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But since today, this new measure has been taken against the swans, against those who stamp and then go for a coffee at the bar at work hours.
The anti-Fannullan news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services" explains the minister.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is reformism," Brunetta continues.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no resistances from employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a process shared by workers and there was the collaboration of all."
I mean, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a conference at the High School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the absences for illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is 60 thousand more people at work in one year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - have been double in the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees joined in challenging the rules of Brunetta decree by joining the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today banners numbers about the least absenteeism at work because of illness - he writes the consumer association - the people of 'operose fannullions' are growing steadily.
In fact, thousands of employees in Italy of the correct and productive public administration who have joined together to declare war to the illegitimate rules contained in the decree".
In particular, Tar will be opposed to the exclusion of additional economic treatments for sickness dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the hours of reconnaissance of the sick worker, within which inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Work Accidents, Napolitano: "Criminal Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that the white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double the deaths from homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic events of these days confirm how crucial both the question of prevention at work," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association Mutilated and Disabled of Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "live appreciation for the ongoing association commitment to prevention at work, protection of unfortunate workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness of public opinion".
"It has, of course, raised a 'sufficient' outrage, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, provoke the cries of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality re-proposes dramatic cases, even repetitions in their dynamics."
Napolitan does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particularly significant are the many initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness of young people facing the world of work.
It is important to keep an eye on the phenomenon, not to delay in alarming its social gravity, to apply and improve legislative rules.
For his part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a firm commitment to bring you to an urgent end".
"Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive development, but this does not remove that the number of white deaths is nevertheless impressive," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not, in fact, want this "low-down trend" to be less attention, because it is precisely when attention slows down that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at general level there is still too little to tackle the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion - it has emphasized Mercandelli - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as far as communication and public awareness are concerned.
But, above all, there is a need for greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation provided for the victims of work" and "the last care system towards which the system is moving in recent years".
"The objective is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who are unfortunate should not depend on spontaneousisms or occasionally extension arranged by the legislator."
Mp3 readers under charge, put the audience at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a prolonged period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission says, which in a statement published in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (Cssseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - we read in the note - it turns out that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day while holding the high volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at high sound levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - the EU responsible continues - there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most, we need to raise consumers' awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the widespread use of portable musical equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical equipment and similar equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by resorting to solutions such as reduction of levels and duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical equipment listen to music (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limits on maximum noise at work.
Those who listen to music in these conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would cover 5-10% of users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the money will be drawn.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the talks are closed in March, the Junta and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bull" of the Campidoglio and its Mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - it would stress German - it will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome, of which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the municipal Council, will then be able to avail themselves.
There is no overlap of roles but only the desire to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then he will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital."
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, since its opinions will not be binding, German replied: "Everything depends on the work that will be able to do the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often policy is crushed on the management of daily life and on the emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, from a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome aims to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless nor a body: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a euro and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences that express Capital".
For German, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which it has absolutely needed, thinking in a spirit of unity to its future."
A future which, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the only current municipal borders but will look well beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president.
He wrote a well-known American politician that wants us to go independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, deciphered the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
She wrote a Miami lady on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big tough face: he thinks he will win the highest charge of a nation he has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will they be a good president? Then there's polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
In this case too, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the southern parts of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the voting booth we know well who will give his vote to the American patriot.
It comes out on one side of the American mentality held covered until the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: If Obama wins, we'll leave America.
What he has never said before, which almost certainly appears to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kick in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
U.S.A., the economic gap also makes you feel about journalists: in newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the internet, "murder" for printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the POW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control as far as the future is concerned.
Well, today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for US journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want traditional journalism as the general public intends to change substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the US journalist today.
Six out of ten senior newspapermen and executives are convinced that the national newspaper is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses open up to the internet, for many views like the "murder" of printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists are warning has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that they "do something good" for their journalism.
The largest break today in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms - i.e. directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some it has to do with "working safety".
Executives who think of losing their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the staff reporters it goes to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, tv and internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can also earn $10,000 a month, as well as pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third year to reach 15 total days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPLA RESTAURING THE GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate owner Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a residence in the city of Rome.
Coppola shall be investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the counter-patch investigation concerning the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the trial, last week, he was discharged from the households transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate company to travel from the provincial town to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (which the pm gave the opposite view) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that he is accused of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 billion-dollar rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation of yesterday's New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is breaking down the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, by the way, which became prepotently alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
However, this is only an example of the changes, of the major changes, which the ongoing economic earthquake may pre-announce or already lets notice: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps even here only.
Both in the US and in Europe the crisis seems to be a accelerator of incubation phenomena for long and in the new climate they are solidifying and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary relaunching, of the dual category State-Sovereignity in relation to a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, close ties with the outside world, but which at first see the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems largely out of play or has little to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union which divides as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies cannot decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when it comes to tights it is only the States that own economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in sixth place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which no market and no international organisation will ever be able to provide to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the institutional-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor that is very closely related to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of immaterials, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized from one point that our future will have to do more with those very little material things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are nevertheless absolutely connected to a confined space, to a territory.
As for those who are sovereign, they certainly have several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second news, however, which predicts a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discretion for existing leadership, economic species, turned out to be so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And together something even deeper and in a certain disquieting sense: a discreet, insufficient, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
That is to say, it seems that in many sectors of the population, the belief that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far at the height, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall meaning of the term, that they have made their own time and that they are increasingly alien to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branch but powerful movement of dellegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political arrangements, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolts" election or in sudden developments of the collective moods of recent and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the workers' consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape today in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis revives, increases, stirs up potentially in dismusement.
In view of all this speaking of a "mass rebellion" on the agenda would be quite frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not at all.
The supercolla to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has gone very close.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters the scholars managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American magazine Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The beginning of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes installed as a stack of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered by microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "it easily pulls off the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton.
CAMMINARE SUI MURI? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat conductors and electric current.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented a microfibre adhesive as hair that self-cleans themselves from the dust during the movement on a surface to maintain always a perfect grip.
Pharmacists: never with fruit juices
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because of the fact that they are rich in vitamins, if they are taken at the same time with some life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing them depending on the efficacy with even serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with taking certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, cancels the beneficial effects and endangers the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice had already ended under the charge because it considered responsible for increasing up to levels considered toxic the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stamine and neurological medicinal products.
PHARMACI A RISCHIO - The same Italian Medicine Agency had reported it in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mix and to take care of what you drink if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
Not only Pompeelmo - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit medicines.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"This discovery is usually reported to the various agencies of the international and national drug that may change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is anything that is not clear, do not make us impress but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» the expert pointed out to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel in Economics in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the attacks in September 2001, on the days of Enron's failure, Krugman had planned in an editorial published on the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that triggered not a few polemics and that for years was reversed to the economist, but now it has proved true.
"I am surprised and also a bit shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high value economist", but also a very aggressive, particularly critical divulner against the excesses of freedom of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of OpenOffice.org's release 3.0, the open-source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year's work by voluntary developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with different news: to the welcome screen and to the revised and made less spartan interface, they add more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also put to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are some specific features of some modules such as that which allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them via e-mail, or the possibility to import PDF files into the graphics processing module, preserving the original look of the page.
Also on this front you can create documents "hybrid PDF", which combine the typical graphics of Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a text computer.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene by hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text maker, each employee is assigned a color in comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some features of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The version in Italian is available at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that was on the mirrors from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can also send the installation cd to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a drive to spread in houses, it is precisely in business that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, and can already count on several projects made in public administration and schools.
And there are also realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding videowriting of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the emulate presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are nearly 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third grade and winner of the best scaler shirt.
To report the news is the website of the daily L'Equipe.
The 26th-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third-generation Epoch, after the Italian Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also him of the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl blood samples is among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will meet two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity to the Third Generation Epoch is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26th-year-old Austrian has placed himself on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climber bean shirt.
NEW YORK TIMES AND CHIEDE, IS ITALY RAZZIST?
Italy "from the country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
This is transforming the Belpaese into a nation of racists? Is that what is asked in a long article the New York Times that devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where we register "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support to the North League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation required by the League which tightens the barriers to immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal persons is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Diorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at Quirinale called for the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism".
Student victims of car rentals up to 900 euros for one room
The rent market for university students does not know about crisis.
According to the last investigation of Sunia, the renting union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now assumed very serious features to the point where young people should be excluded from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should support - explains Sunia's head of study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so distorted the market to trigger a process of generalized increase also for residents."
In most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without the limit of canon, related sub-rents.
For Sunia, there is a need for extraordinary interventions which, through the revision of tax taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambia, Udine and Faira) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed place costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, they need 250/280 euros for one bed in a double place, from 370 to 500 for one single.
In Rome in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinematà).
It saves only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples there are 300/450 euros for one room, from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed place you will need 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities where renting to extra-Community students, such as Perugia, is more frequent, there is also an additional anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested to foreign students than that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, cities erase historic rooms
Historical cinemas close in favour of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic halls is a blind city, it's like an eyeless face."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornator effectively photographes what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of large multisales and the consequent death by constipation of monosals in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us inelutable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
Disappearing are often historical places and loads of memory," it is as if less a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of street and many emotions," observes the director of New Cinema Paradiso, the film that lasts twenty years in Tornatore the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and which told the poetry of a province hall and nostalgia for a way of living the film lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the exhibitors, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and to pay for the major show are mainly the rooms in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multi-sala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures but it would need to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund for the workers: the government's debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not comply with existing laws.
In order to support the sector, it would be worth between 16 and 18 million euros per year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, has decided to run the shelters with the signing of a protocol between Town and Anec, the first such in Italy, to protect and promote the cinemas monosala both in the historical centre and in the outskirts.
Among the rules provided are tax facilitation measures for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators can enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for stopping and parking.
"It's an initiative I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counter the strain of multiplex, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public is more demanding today.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise Cinema", to which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, there where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the signs erased from the dust I turn to the other side".
Links between politics and 'dragheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the choices of the Commune to the interests of the Pyromalli cosca".
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the anti-mafia Directorate of Calabria address the mayor and vice-syndaco of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in Mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already sentenced by association to criminalize mafia stamp, condemned to repay 10 million euros.
"In contempt for any legal and moral rule, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to Lawyer Piromalli.
"It would thus have been granted to the cosca - they write the judges - to officially enter the municipalities by facilitating the already large possibilities of control and address of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "colossies between local authorities and organized malavita there are several of them" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'dragheta, heroes who keep themselves clean'.
This morning's arrest follows last July when the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli shell.
Since the end of April last year, the town council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been raised by the commission to administer the Commune.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, was elected head of a central right coalition, after the ballotage of May 2006.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli shell had even come to demand the variation of the project of the A3.
From the environmental intercepts ordered against Dal Torrione, they write the pm, emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group notoriously close to the Pyromalli, conforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones go down in the field.
It is an extinct land, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by major global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources upon which they have set their eyes, and now they are trying to lay hands, colossal like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the environmental demands and the new increase of oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea-wave mining facilities.
This would be twice as much of the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Put on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enerssis, which signed an agreement in 2005 to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
At two years' distance to bet on marine energy are becoming more and more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Cevron is studying ocean energy technologies - he has declared the spokesperson of a company associated with the US oil giant to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not recently, especially if it is considered that in Alaska the U.S. continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new trevelations.
In addition to the Chevron there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey along the energy road that comes from the sea and the amounts invested so far, as little is known in the details, indicate to the observers an interest in ascendancy.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about technology still at the dawn, even because marine energy does not escape all doubts about environmental impact.
For now plants such as Portuguese or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major ecosystem problems.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, technology must be used with greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of cattle connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the oxen up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such plants in design, waiting only for federal approval and part of energy could serve for a military installation.
On the other hand, Verdant Power already produces energy for a shopping centre and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, now deserves the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely about the energy of the tides that have been like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others facing the coast, have already invested $7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million in 2009.
