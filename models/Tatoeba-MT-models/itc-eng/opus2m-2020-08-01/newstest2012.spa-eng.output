Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic offences at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison by the alleged signing of a disadvantaged agreement with Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet firm, the appeal court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
Libya’s Victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or of Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
It remains to be defined who the winner is
As is customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it's about diluting whether it's moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, sharia, which we already know in some way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will cut off their hands.
Women can already forget to be emancipated and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, made up of warrior tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only one nor objectively the best, and probably it was not for the Libyans already mentioned.
The fact is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters will accept the help of unfaithful dogs gratefully.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO attacks did not lead them to an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting of what Islamists and our politicians are using to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
Following the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, there is no problem for locals to expel the "crosss"
But without occupation will the oil tankers be able to make themselves with Libyan black gold only in good words?
It is quite possible that it will not, but it may be that the West can finally assume that it can protect human rights.
As long as the sharia followers don't cross us.
Starts a new era of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe go hunting for investors
A statistical turbulence has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarterly period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer only set in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of Eurozone, Germany, Czechia and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, Germany has improved more than expected (increase of 0.3% instead of forecast 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the inter-four-monthly period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to ČSU conforms to the trend towards gradual slowdown in economic development growth.
The results are even worse than the analysts' forecasts.
Main events:
On an annual basis, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, but four months ago it stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to the previous data and seasonally recalculated, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% on an annual basis.
The interest of their ten-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem situation also begins to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of Czech bonds at the age of 10 remain at 4 per cent, although in the area the situation is worsening.
In Germany voices are raised saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs are classified for the Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium 200 million.
The football team meets the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant porter Petr Jiraček, the victory was given for 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, stood up fantastically against the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the quote of the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a thorough report.
There was almost excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiraček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrin did not press until the second half.
The two injured parties were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who let go of two major occasions.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the quote of the European Cup, so the national football vessels will receive a gratification of about 200 million kroner.
Since the first few minutes, a good offensive game has been played.
Both teams only focused on keeping the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicked off the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
They want to express their support for your country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying Tuesday at noon at the facilities and then ran death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahán human shields around the nuclear technology centre in which they work with uranium.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend your country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran, according to all indications, is striving to achieve nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students prayed at noon at Isfahan's nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme would be, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan power station, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner stuffed
Over one third of children aged between 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and 5% obesity.
Obese children come from most families with an unhealthy lifestyle, as is the case with current research.
The importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference, is demonstrated again.
At the table, obsessive children, for example, are fed of embuty at least twice as often as children of normal weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence".
In overweight families there is no habit of sports, which applies to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of the last year of school and participated in the same nearly 900 basic education children from all over Czechia.
It was already the second edition of the program of "Obesity of Not a Accident", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th course.
A proper diet and exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly decrease the number of children with overweight and even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five daily meals according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," one of the survey's results.
No breakfast but with ink for dinner
Experts warn that, in a healthy development, details are also important, such as having a set time for family breakfast.
In Czechia, however, only 23 per cent of school families are having breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10 per cent of the homes there is no breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that the families of obese children are much more often consumed with sick fries.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily sweet soft drinks (70%).
Usually they do more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled selected boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age, from the point of view of healthy diet, are far from ideal."
Among its favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is especially alarming the popularity of sweet soft drinks," the final report of the study warns.
As the main food, the pasta is taken away and the poultry meat is closely followed by it.
Practically, children always reject legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who completed the questionnaire after the end of the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence," in many cases an important change was made in favour of the principles of healthy diet," points to the results of the study.
Call attention, for example, to the matter of soft drinks, where many children would begin to prefer normal and common water.
Children would also choose poultry meat and fish for main food more frequently in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, support professionals
In the introductory article, How the stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences by three professionals in the field, how to dress up problematic characters and also a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer final exams, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is no longer a thread.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the great majority.
Someone is short, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone suffers overweight.
The designer must know how to optically smooth wide shoulders, extend a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given some tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer López, of huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or trousers are not adapted, it is worth making you sew at least one piece of extra fabric tailored.
They will certainly not repent, because the clothing they feel perfectly is priceless.
With a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or flags.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I'm glad that I have all week to order all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid that with the task assigned, I already have more than leftover.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous ones, to whom two costumes have to be designed: one for the day and one for the night.
We must take into account the current aspect, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've been "dressed" to Miranda Kerr, maybe you'll meet Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it's much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently fattened about 100 kilos (please consider exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gómez.
We have to trim them from magazines or search them on the Internet and print them, and then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The designer, therefore, did not dress only physically, but also took care, for example, of the product pages in magazines (of specific themes, such as trends, pockets, shelters, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník told us all about this.
But all this is already left for Sunday.
The designer must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all kinds of bodies.
The designer Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And a good designer knows how to work with the same dress in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classics with cowboys and shirts, but also serves to dress the naked body with heels and photograph it as if it were really a dress.
Or it's enough to rip it up and climb the neck to get a totally different image.
"Play with it," he urged us.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to first know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," said Jakub.
Finally, it is clear to me why we memorize all those formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That without talking about parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes on the reservation he wants to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so ten outfits), you have to be prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos of clothing works in combination with other garments, they are all different from those used in reality.
All of this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are only, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In Czechia, for the moment, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of the stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (I just have my skills, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to bear in mind that they are very likely to show us a very different size from their real (less) size.
Then there's just a goggle and find out if the heart magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/delgated, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the designer is not enough to focus on fashion, but he has to understand outfit.
During his work, it is especially necessary to communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss them, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify her dress and complete it with pretty clothes, you can't take and throw away everything there was and say, "I'm what a horror"."
"Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend so someone can put them on," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything must fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
It is fixed around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects like scissors, scissors, chitapeluses, or impermissible. There are also nylon yarn (which serves the stylist during the session of photos of products such as bags or hats), special tangles of clothing front if it was larger (the threads and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to wear the soles of the shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the ground could be damaged and much more the exterior.
And we did nothing but wrap and cover.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so they wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work without reservation.
The truth is, I don't really get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of all we have heard during the whole weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedicating myself to styling on a professional level is not a rose path, but it gives me exactly what people say.
At Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A trip, in principle neglected, is complicated by a series of improper neglects of a routine journey during the morning shift.
To some extent expectations were met, but that is no use if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new delivery, to which the title is added The Run, aroused great expectations already before its premiere.
I promised that I would give new air to the old race saga Need for Speed and, as shown, appears as a game that should not end up again being a genre of action without more.
We also feel curious about how the scenes would stay, where the main character descends from the car and walks by his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are careers that can be done for acceptable, but in the total calculation points are lost due to absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality, they cannot be called errors, but rather, they are the incomprehensible detachment of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, you don’t even have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to see, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
So it's nothing of the other world.
But the stroll through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, racing is now and again diversified by an atypical element.
For example, in the wilderness you find a sandstorm that diminishes visibility.
On the other hand, you must be careful not to bury an avalanche in the mountains.
According to that, each race is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance a number of required rivals (the normal in a classic race), then try to earn time (the classic timed duel) and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the middle of all this, sometimes the police appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite fewer landscapes in the game than could be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not get upset and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that makes the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the tracks of previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a career designed with a lot of action is quite convenient for this driving style, although we can find something better among competition games.
So far, everything's in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
From games like this you can't expect to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, so it's not all in order.
It is typical that, by making a very adjusted advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight pinks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
It's even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no major problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are scheduled in such a way that, when you have an accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five recipes are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something doesn't go well, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, nor the reset helps, only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, you cannot take it.
Sometimes you will find yourself in some "civil" vehicle site always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth, or you arrive five minutes before or after.
This causes anger especially in situations, when you see two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must either turn around or stop.
It's the same when you get here, because it's programmed that the "surprise" will always happen in front of your nose.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, you will always advance the same opponent on the same site.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it comes to you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming in front of you, so at first you can make the car roll.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspension and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you immediately.
And it's a shame, because even if the travel model is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive clues or the ranking in the race so that it doesn't break the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during racing.
You have to be careful about the gas pumps next to the road, because that's exactly where you have to change cars, although in most cases what you have will be enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, U.S. strong cars for straight highways and super-deportable exotics for technical driving, for example by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know about history.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the upper level, the driver is opened up several possibilities, starting with the car and finishing with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an Autolog feature is connected online, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race is made in history.
With the car you reach the subway tunnel (passe), where you run dark through the tracks (passe).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (passe) and, suddenly, the metro convoy arrives behind you and takes you forward without more.
In writing we will probably have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or whether the authors actually take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
For what a pity it is that, at the most tense times, the quality of the image is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each one of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.
If the game avoids absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have trouble saying that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
Fun is assured, but prepare because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of some airport reflectors.

Ambassador to the EU, Vice-Nová:
Czechs have a reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war to take place without a barracks."
"It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," the Czech Ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began her conference at the Faculty of Law.
How not to take his motto "clearly and openly on Europe" seriously, which he said at the first part of his conference, when he was able to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers at the Faculty of Law of the United States of Carolina.
Vice-nová also put the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first is criticism, which, if it is insular, a grey official, able to assume any role, but I must say that he has left everyone confused, because he assumes his roles to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of Representative for Foreign Policy and Security is explained on the basis of the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards unifying and clarifying political union towards States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban Olomouc's cheese
Vice-Nova has also taken up the agenda, followed and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czechia.
Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good noise", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget must be approved, caused by the current economic situation, which is much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which fewer? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreigners or gergas that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that the cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels, the curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban Olomouc's cheese?"
It also aims to make more use of the EU's environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to European institutions.
Europe is waiting for us to be speeded up.
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
It also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is on many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"I think when they come to me a Polish and a Hungarian and I'm approached by a Slovak, a Frenchman next to me says to me, "What, have you already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?", and you see it doesn't make you any grace."
In the future, the EU, according to Vice-Nová, is awaiting new tough budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe than the new of the "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only the countries you want and the ones you don't, that you stay out of it."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe at both speeds," Vice-nová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of Chequia and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU must be discussed among the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that would define the IBM strategy very precisely, the approximate one would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, has already been 100 years since its foundation.
The foundation of this long-lasting character was laid by the first head of the signature, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his stamp, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM started publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised business culture.
"For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for 100 years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
This has enabled us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even further in our second century," he said during his birthday, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees such as the employer of Ba.A. in Chequia (the employees of IBM were the first U.S. workers to enjoy paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in relation to the customer.
From the beginning, the company was able to discover talents (as one of the first world companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without any problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, so Palmisano will replace it in the coming year a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She's been working for 30 years at IBM, where she's been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the past few years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual encounters, rain of ideas online, of which there are countless future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that ideas are being raised, because nearly half a million people are working at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technological enterprise," says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology," notes George Colony of the consultant Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between going into the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the United States familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies for the last hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technological company (development of both equipment, programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the largest number of patents from all American technological companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill this year $220 billion. This year has become the second technological firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or PCjr IBM computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be anchored emotionally in the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its foundations on other platforms (and likewise, if it doesn't work, it leaves them).
And this is the difference of competition, Microsoft, which basically maintains and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are programmes and another fifth equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the supplier's share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets of a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time the modern global financial crisis was manifested.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investment.
So far, it seems, IBM has been able to stop the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has increased stratospherically to 120%, the company’s net profit has not ceased to increase.
IBM's currency is to change everything, except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - it was originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis for the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "fix clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired his supervisory board until 1930.
Flint set the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM ( Watson's ideas remain the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are underpinned).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all types of business appliances, from meat cutters and cheese to register boxes.
During the first four years of Watson's management of the company, billing doubled by $9 million and began the large expansion of the company across the continent.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years after occupying the chair of the chief, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (in Mercury, Saturn and 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the standard of computers of that time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer comprehensive advice and services of high value added.
The strategy that IBM has paid these last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet."
Its objective is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances, for example, in the transport and management of cities have been improved.
For the trade sector, IBM recently presented the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch office in Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Wake up, stay with that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that she would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and have established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but no longer like my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová hosted Bartošové in her house during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after хíčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even dismissed him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not expect him at home with her arms open.
He is my children's biological father and, if you want to live the rest of your life in our home, no one will throw it away."
"But here I would live not as my dear and old drunk who was wrong, but as a man to whom I am bound," Rychtářová said and added that he had already disengaged himself from his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef doesn't care that his wife has shut the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife set this up as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talk normally, only we don't share bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová finds a new love, he would not object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, or where she goes or whether she has any boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Josef concludes.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that can boil blood to men?
Go shopping
Do you reproach your orange average that it's dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one trapitum a week?
Do you like to buy often on the discount?
Then in your case you can say that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should pacify their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to walk without more around the clothes stores, look for well-adjusted clothes and then try them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women going shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner that you better wait for her in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I'd need to slow down at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like it?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
Is that so?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It is not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listening to your partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more frequent complaints, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
He's like an infinite tiovative.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, scrub the floor, remove the dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Does she blame her partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, her children who have dirtyed a freshly cleaned toilet and a shelf with glass doors that cost her so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be overstated and that order and cleanliness should surely not be a primary concern in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family welfare.
Make unpleasant comments
"The underpants are left with the dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too."
"The wet cloth is not left on the ground!"
If he makes those cometaries to his partner more times a day, he knows he will get it out of his boxes.
Of course. You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Squeezes and sparks
Some women also have slanders, gossips, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how and why.
At best each of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless schism.
With the hand in the heart, this is owned by almost all women.
On the other hand, there are funny women of those who are not controlled, who love to gossip and often do so, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Voraček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
The front of hockey Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assists who brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in the Carolina field and put the Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the play of the 39-year-old star, and took another step and was declared best player of the game.
Two attendances were awarded at the Jágr party and Jakub Voraček's partner.
After the meeting, Jágr said to the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the game I had told him I'd make triplet."
"I was introducing him."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first retreat of the Flyers.
A while later the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trail.
Voraček made himself with the record behind the Hurrician gate and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After working with Jágr, he scored the third goal, after his shot crashed through Wayne Simmonds' fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player on the field, but he's definitely among the best three," Jagr put his center on.
"It would never have happened to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very pleased with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years at the NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now produces results," Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the party into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, of penalti, to get to a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up out of number two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to tie him to the record and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the last goal of the party as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired for an injury at the top of the body.
Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defence experience but also due to a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were new."
"Finally, but against that nothing can be done, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"As much rotation as the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, remove the record from our field."
"And so we leave it hollow," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Porter Ondřej Pavelec contributed with thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over the Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were marked by five players who ended a series of defeats that were already lasting five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases travel only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on vacation to the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime bent west and the journeys of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually not even by the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West in those days, but one was supposed to put himself in line with a sleeping bag and spend all night, or have "well known" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" which was the condition for trips to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable agent", which thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without exchange guarantee, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their vacations in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses that the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way of travelling the Czechs has suffered a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was not going to spend any more holidays in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, the visa exemption was imposed to travel to Western European neighbouring States, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see themselves fed up with excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech groups slept in parks in tents, since our income from then did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to carry with them food (preserved, stuffed, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it also average wages, which led to an increase in travel demand around 1997.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began to regularly prepare trips using charter flight connections from 1997 onwards, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for passenger volumes.
By the end of the 90th century, the Czechs were already travelling visa-free to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism occurred in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czechia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
From that year onwards, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have been flying away and hot. This winter will be flying directly from Czechia to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting around 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutional development, arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. eliminated visas for Czech tourists, so our country became among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent on trips abroad more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head, including expenses at the residence site.
Called Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up again in a dead end.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without president and Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) is likely to not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
Indeed, agreement has not yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without the same, you cannot even vote to choose from the three candidates.
Interested in chairing Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June, not before calling on his colleagues to find a strong person who knew how to handle football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hašek era, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evidenced on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní d Łm), located in the Prague neighborhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only about the method of choice.
No consensus was reached on who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment on, and because of this only point, there was a partial agreement, supported also by the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer cast the Executive Committee, which, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times now, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: How do we proceed in the third round to avoid the dead spot?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three FAČR vice presidents, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round you will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which you will apply.
The Moravia Region is prepared to reach a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The bohemia part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would take away, however, the meaning from the two previous rounds and deny the concept of a bicameral system completely", as Svoboda understands the objections of the resident party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With this, surprisingly, he also agrees with Tomaš Paclík, although the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like it to be voted as much as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"To avoid any nonsense about representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who applied for the first time as a candidate and directed his observations mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be pacified with the party of our national team today at the European Championship.
"Soccer football will be again protagonists, and so will cooperate more willingly," said Jablonice's representative, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between bohemians and hustlemen, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"However, I hope the common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There's not much time left for all sides to come to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the football team is complete?
The special aircraft, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport to the part of the executive committee where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could finally take place at the ministerial level, which they consider will take place this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the parties divided into the country's most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to Czech sport following the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclic will struggle to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the Chief of Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate who satisfied all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not be nominated for such a relevant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I'd be fighting for her and I wouldn't run for election."
"But so far no such person has been found," said Paclík for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclic to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, which opens the way to the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) presidency.
Paclic also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in office as president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already spoken to some people I could take into account."
"To me it was crazy to hear some say that at this moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What is supposed to be most disturbing to Paclík right now is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Regional Football Association of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates at the general assembly.
For Paclic it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case you win, the status in force and nothing in football will change."
"With Berbra's support, an ambitious business man, football will make even less profit," Paclík said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a telephone call during the investigation of a corruption case, of which Pelta was impunity.
"I don't know what prestige football can bring to Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "would sell Club Pilsen if Pelta became president."
In the case of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík could come up with cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Similarly, the other candidate, Rajchl, who was supported by Paclic before the September General Assembly, ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as an association manager."
"I don't even put my noses where I don't feel capable," added Paclík, who in September drew great attention to supporting the suspension of the Committee of Referees chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclic admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It uses its management capabilities for private companies, since last summer it is also the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the triumph in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations," said Paclík without hiding his antipathies against Sparta President Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he exerted pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be dedicated."
"If you increase the taxes on gambling, as announced by the political parties, you would support your arguments, but frankly you have to tell us where all this money is going to stop," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with Club Pilsner, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablnek and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in yielding hypocritically my actions from the Plsen Club to another person and then come back there after a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the election.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if he was elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve future electoral settlement disputes.
The representative of Jablnek is optimistic about the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Prior to the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fund-raising.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could help him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People at all levels are dealing with football a long time ago and expect to meet the new President on Thursday."
"They feel the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who mainly associated with the Club de Jablonice, but who worked in the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, you think you have enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, in the June General Assembly, the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought they were."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a sign to win delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to respond in case this fails."
"It is a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Moreover, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
In the past, he had warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, whom he respected for his law training, knowing that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not let his head slip.
"It's been more than a year in the world of football, and it's already achieved some success."
"His attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," said their opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the highest.
The latter should be a football promotion shop.
"Likely, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately become involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for the whole football," said the 46-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes to the staff.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov, where, after a long period of anarchy, there is an understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain on Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will be recovered only if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in its career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, FAČR would start working eagerly.
If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl was elected in the fourth General Assembly as the new President of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be disappointed.
Rajchl promises that if he was elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each football area individually.
It is also committed to resolving the case of Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing with the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to dedicate myself to football completely."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, going through professional football or training of high-performance young footballers."
"With this I don't mean I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can devote himself to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of these segments, move forward with great momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered not to be a candidate again.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and hinder me at every step," he explained.
"A lot of people have told me that I must not give up, because then others too would be defeated."
"It's about having faith not to give up like this, without more," he said.
As they say, it also motivates him to continue his work with Hašek.
"During those two years, a great deal of work was finished that I don't want to get lost now."
"There are processes that have begun and will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he announced concerned that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before Hašek's time.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be just a privilege for a few chosen ones."
"I may be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to play football for everyone, because that's the only way they'll feel good about everyone and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind doing my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second division into one part of the Czech and one part of the Morava, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would not be the current situation in which we have only three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Tomš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, was joined in the battle of presidential elections, Rajchl believes in his possibility of being elected.
"I still feel strongly supported by the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include the saving of some tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, the negotiations on television contracts and the negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his share of guilt in which the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "unqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and will not significantly change staff staffing on committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," he thus evaluates his Rajchl rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous bathrooms in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can experience their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their weary legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made an investigation trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missing in his luggage, a bather.
He looked at the dome at the top, swam towards the marble angels, who waited at the edge of the pool and amazed at the indoor modernist pool restored meticulously.
He liked the bathroom, took note of his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectonic historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the pools covered in Munich, the historic bathrooms in the Black Forest, the "constructions of concrete" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the bathroom culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers him that fans of the bathroom have to conform with blue tiles and chlorine oysters, while fans of running can breathe the fascinating smell of the fir forests or listen to the cheerful bird tribes in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools should always be so ugly," says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The hat in the pool and the ethereal sauna oils. The well-being factor in the pools is so big because they take care of all the senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of ground, in the bathrooms there is a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically folded: the high vaults, the coloured tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides on 190 pages very interesting data about architecture and art history in the historical oasis of well-being, but, above all, it is eager to jump to blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding copies of his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medical baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, water with nitrates is found in a unique karstic cavity (cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a few thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline water and are found in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts eyes on the rooftop pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, from the outdoor pool of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal's water cathedral looks like an ovni that just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs rises steam in winter, while at the bottom the Ötztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulphur in the Arpad baths in Békssaba, Hungary, the gas oil plague is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legamo stick to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder also disappointed himself in one place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered pools and sunbathings in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, he found a blocked land.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the collapsed windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the weeds grow among the tiles.
The decline against it stood in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; not only can neo-Romanic elements of time be discovered from their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall of Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its smerada modernization in 1995, the Palacio Termal is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural of the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," says Meder.
In a palace like this, immersion in the thermal pool seems to be of little importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to verify the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the consortium leader wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to one study, that 84 percent of Germans do not seem acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from this business because it intensifys the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey by consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study was based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity stock market bets raise prices, and the banks bear responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer campaign specifically targets Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity betting was considered to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have disengaged themselves from offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "needs to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann's trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The growing food prices of bets show in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks are currently damaging public well-being."
Ackermann is the largest bank waiter, especially in the obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio where it puts the money into play for food price bets," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of people starving or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the consortium leader wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different than not planned in the board of directors.
By abandoning the controversial agrarian speculation, you can perfect your image.
And he needs you to just care about possible losses, that's what his successor will deal with.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure high on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1.001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were wagered.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences upon discovering that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank to its acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, cancel its account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The Pavilion Moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with high heights and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition, won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and collapsed.
Now it reopens as a house of exhibitions.
Modern postgerra architecture is passionate, clear shapes, crystal halls, brave curves and new building materials, typical of the technical progress thinking, so the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to be a contemporary milestone of architecture to date.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building flattened in Munich, it became internationally known.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, rose after the universal exhibition at Schweizer Garten next to the station of southern Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and a 20th century museum was inaugurated inside.
The building was suitable but lacked adequate spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art or a good environment.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is declining more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "House 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Belvedere Museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in some way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belgian gallery since 2007, achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, art skater on ice in her youth, later in Sotheby, Guggenheim Museum and founder director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out reforms with the insistence of politicians and monument protectors, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation should be exposed, there should be a café and a library and also a building of offices.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only did Joseph Olbrichs' secession in Vienna change significantly, he expanded and was awarded the contest, but he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He was aware of the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are great problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the glass façade was changed, a reinforced insulating glass fibre glass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or replaced and asbestos ceilings rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the pavilion of Schwanzer.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old caoba tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly the way it used to be.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and would also like the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and warns of rough soil in the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The one of the flag "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, said Krischanitz recently, a typical "occasional appearance in the history of the city".
An architecture like this is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted "to awaken the right consciousness."
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been a hit of urban luck. The totally new and planned "central station barrio", with houses and offices, is located next to Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another blow happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as it is heard, negotiates with the city about a nearby place in Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that reaches millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid the breakdowns of trains in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
What it costs millions.
In the fight against the losses and delays of trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a journalistic report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of planned investments up to 2005 of about 300 million euros.
In order to achieve a better availability of vehicles and the railway network, there is still an extreme amount of time.
Among other things, it is planned to double domestic and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the roads and from the Andeans.
The aim is to clean the snow and ice pads for operation and 90 percent of the needles necessary for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of injuries and delays on trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of travellers, as, among other things, he lacked reservations about adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains often in the workshop, after a high-speed train had broken an axis at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millionaire fines in the United States
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not sufficient for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (EUR 106 million) in an agreement, to put an end to the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
The NCAA financial market regulator criminalizes many large banks inducing credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
These titles lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to the courts," said a spokesman for the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, President of the NCA, welcomed the deferral of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US credit cooperatives and supports bankruptcies to protect client investments.
The NCA is attempting to reinstate the losses of millions of people.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also called for accounts from other major banks and in the summer on JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed values.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial entities.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results occurred a few years ago, today there is a complicated wind for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have initiated countless proceedings to receive compensation or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of requests.
It appeals to the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has an FHFA demand, which is worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without specifying an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests forcefully in the information technology company IBM.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or information technology since the long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM's commercial report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He had to understand long before IBM offered above all services and looked for computer systems for other companies' information technology departments.
In the financial world, a Warren Buffett investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the early information technology must be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed in the CNBC economy station that has acquired shares of IBM worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hataway investment has thus increased one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent shareholding.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the engagement so far.
He commended the leadership in dealing with the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They did a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative information technology services such as the operation of calculation centres.
The old computer pioneer over 100 years old also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett avoided technology companies so far.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, expanded it to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life - style is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors all over the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname "Omaha Oracle."
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM shares in the stock exchange rose by one percent.
"The blue giant", as known to IBM, has a stock market value of over 220 billion dollars and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "Zwickau's cell", Turkish media doubt the state of German law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that revives itself again.
The murders of eight small, trick and Greek entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a background from the far right.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
Many Germans of Turkish origin return a ghost that was believed to be dead long ago, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The ultra-rightist network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived again?" he wrote, entitled "Haberturk" newspaper's online edition.
The newspaper "Sabah" points out on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informer of the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightist pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a wake at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn event of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, as a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" does not insist on tracing this mental connection either.
"Start smelling bad," says the title of Ahmet Külahci column.
He noted that the killers were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Turkish-derived German Internet forums, police behavior and subsequent success in the search are very critically discussed.
The authors are amazed that the German authorities have not sought suspects in the outer circle long before.
Some are at least rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on it is lost, immigrants are left only self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of sanctions to the entire network.", writes Selen.
This means that if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks by Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in 90 years.
The image of the fire ruins of Solingen has been recorded in the German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks who live here that there is a concrete threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks amplify the sense of group of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past mistakes
Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire-shaped attack by Solingen sent a telegram of pity to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what contributes to the taxes of the Turkish in Germany.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his tax.
The current information from the Turkish media shows again how profound it has been since the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a re-evaluation of extreme right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The Zurich Lake Scandal Bank
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost broke into the financial crisis and since then it has emerged from a crisis to the next.
Now she's run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After its spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was known that it would begin in 2013 in a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the administrative council of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomes Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and leaves friendly comments on its future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm glad to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and cheated EUR 1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, director general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to attend.
The president of the USB board has since been considered equally touched, and everyone has asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber should advise the bank since February 2012.
And it will take over the presidency of the administrative council in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economy and counselor and has had a period of certainly necessary adaptation.
Suddenly he is responsible for a bank's strategy, which has just proved again that he deserves the title "the biggest bank of the European scandal" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the largest administrator of world goods, and on the other hand, for years, it has been sliding from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the old so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss property manager, but also handy, was combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the big banks of the world.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later bank professor in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one asks, "How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, director general, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was set up in high-risk losses and had to depreciate billions.
To load this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course some would look with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first shot.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 at the second best paid administrative council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic UBS values for many billions, the Helvetical Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, making it the co-ownership of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, it was said how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't rescue UBS again," said Geiger, bank expert.
The first catastrophe joined the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and showed willingness to deliver data from wealthy customers, who had possibly cheated taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS confessed more or less to helping with tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in competition by rich customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the President of the Board and the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through erroneous speculation and in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud.
And just as I was feeling a little calmer again, just when I thought UBS was going to get it back, this undivided operator's story happens, an individual operator cheated 1.7 billion euros before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, by the way, this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"In the case of Adobe, it is stated that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The UBS problem is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers have long shown themselves, was to be the guardians of the world's greatest goods: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break across the Alpine Republic.
The security deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of the unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The UBS center in Zurich does not match the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters on Bahnhofstraße street in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you can find jewelry like Tiffany's among traditional Swiss businesses like Sprüngli's.
The Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, passing through Credit Suisse palace, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the bank logo there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both major banks.
UBS has become too large, it is considered, mainly in the investment bank, where Anglo-Saxons have gained land.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they've been used to Anglo-Saxon customs for a long time."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the large Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the little country of seven million decided the greatest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How do they do it?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so you see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks were merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges which, due to the merger, was too large for the little Swiss, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different UBS precursor banks: a rich but sleepy bank with the centre of property management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could run a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one who managed to open up steps from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel made fun of Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly: Desatino arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of directors, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Lower the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "Lague Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well for him.
In foreign exchange operations and stock trading was at the highest.
However, the advisors of the companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the bank language "fixed income", there is huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk US investments.
It became a powerful machine to hold American mortgage credits and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, as other banks looked for the drop for a long time.
"In summer 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," Geiger, a bank expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to leave, since the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The posts at the UBS became projectable seats and are still unsafe.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has almost impossible work.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on managing property, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (always).
But the investment bank must decline considerably, it is now clear.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only 51-year-old Italian-Switzerland was thought of as a transitional solution, since the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he was imposed: He must run UBS business on a permanent basis, the bank of Zurich reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Deletes 3,500 posts.
But this isn't enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask right now.
So far he only says that he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for CNBC.
Therefore, from their point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.

Intelligent fats spread in cities
In many places fats are considered "problem birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the fats have been in the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are accumulated because of the dirt and the noise of the animals.
Although no means have appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
Fats no longer leave the cities, experts say in the first symposium on fats in Leer, East Frisia.
There experts from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected fats in the field; chemical applications in agriculture clearly end up with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing building and the fall of trees that house them make it difficult for birds to live.
Fats are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westfalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jerer, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 the negative press headlines jumped a controversial project to mass-kill the fats of the district.
Critics have qualified animal hunting by trapping birds and killing with sticks as particularly brutal.
"Ejecting them and escaping them in a normal way does not achieve anything," said Werner Klöver, an urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing the trees are usually unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals deviate, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Running them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, residences of elders or colleges.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, according to Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of exhausting animals from sensitive residential areas and onions may be possible to return to other places.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can endure a peak on the face with aplom."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on the fats of Ascheberger, where signs inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms about the noise of birds: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and ability of these animals are legendary, the fats not only use the resources to access a lot of skiers, but also make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethnologists at Cambridge University checked four degrees to where the intelligence of birds comes from.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they should drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they firmly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, astute fats had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers put a small cube with a mole larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the peak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the pipe shooter.
Three of the four fats got it in the first attempt.
Portugal in the Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the latest Eurocopa 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal went to Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after 0-0 of the party of go, made the five participations of the Eurocopa followed.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the game back of the play-offs with the outsider Montenegro, after in the game of go (2-0) they left things clear.
Croatia did not allow them to mark it in 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a 1-1 (1-0) leak against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals in Portugal.
The former Bundesliga professional, Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) cut off twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic obtained a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South African global play-offs.
At the Stadio da Luz de Lisboa, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo executed a direct free from more than 30 meters to get his head on points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to mark from afar and got 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not shine in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the greedy Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, leader of the Englishman Manchester City sent a head-head to the pole, but the balloon did not cross the line of porter (33.).
Jiracek was successful for the Czech Republic
Then Wolfgang Stark Collegiate, Ergolding, was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pitted a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentaro, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended with the last doubt in minute 81. with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth consecutive time for the Eurocopa.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, the doorkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal in his own door of Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the two Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the front turn, very right at the door of Cech.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the width of the world-renowned porter, the FC Seoul front again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end felt the party.
Meanwhile, Turkey took no advantage of Zagreb's football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that the national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his seat of the 2002 global third-party bench, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream principle.
In minute seven and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to hit the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim could not send the balloon inside the door.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took over.
After the break, Croatia did not allow them to score any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, which in minute 62. took place Ivan Perisic, from Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern de Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to Eurocopa
In Dublin, Ireland celebrates its first participation in the Eurocopa since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who triumphed with 4-0 in the party's ready for a previous decision, got to the head in minute 32.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) paired with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but it had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had her first great opportunity.
From the very first moment, the long-term defence avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in minute 32. He moved it forward.
After a defense of the gatekeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, getting 1-0.

Personal slaughter
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about World War I, "starts with a long dramatist person of the type that can make one fall the soul at his feet.
Here are some action tips: Smoothly start this page and convert it to its brand pages.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novel story, and this dramatic personae will work as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments in which, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you have written here is a rare book, which rightly describes as "an anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains, as "a book about how it happened." It deals with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines experiences in times of war of about 20 ordinary men and women, both sides of the war, from colleges and botanists to rockers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative personnel.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go crazy or die.
Their lives flash here as votive candles lit in a church; some new ones add to the mixture while others turn off.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that the First World War was only the deadly trenches war on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" moves expertly through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intratable problem.
This is a touching book, almost from the beginning.
War floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a Katrina hurricane that stinks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman at home with your children, do you stay or flee?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Death of facts," notes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and the pain of battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
Its stories have been obtained in most of the memories, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of your lives can be frightening or touching, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and settling them with what is available.
About telling the story of a German college girl says: "Successful, everywhere successive."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminium, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about the food that happens in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into meat fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There is, he observes, "837 allowed meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes its own impulse towards savagery and expresses itself about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that this varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched and tattooed peach."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once one resigns to the thought of sacrifice, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, it's awfully similar to "a condemned being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a factory war."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the livestock of the young century: The eloquent mass killer and ideologically convinced with good-made clothes that executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both unspeakable and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to take a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to escape service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of gonococic pus, which soldiers buy and immote with it their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, which often gives way to a life-threatening blindness."
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war has "desintegrated exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels such as No novelty on Erich Maria Remark's forehead, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come from his book, ripped from your fingers that page of dramatic personae, and burned it with a necklace.
After a false advance step, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying riot helmets.
Monday night was chosen Tuesday night because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation remained in secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence emphasized how the operation was challenging for the police department.
Recent weeks' episodes could not be repeated, such as spray spraying peppers on protesters, violating the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas".
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of protesters revealed itself after two weeks of planning and training.
Agents had prepared themselves to see how occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called disorder training - counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"The few cops I know who were called for this didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going into Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels in the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, agents wanted to clear the park, but they gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged before long after they heard about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from several police units, including special forces from all over the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who usually flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when there were the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with spotlights and speakers are gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and prerecorded messages from speakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue clips, many protesters simply collected their things and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other agent teams were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesperson for the police department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from getting into action in the park, and that they had been brutally treated by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense maraña of personal effects of protesters, including luggage and bags of paper and plastic stuffed with clothes, cleaning department equipment followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly thereafter.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were chained between them by the arms.
And two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency personnel were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "amendment of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the top official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives in the department, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he wasn't running operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents expected along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, he saw the police expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen pulling the air out of the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of counter-covered flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for dismissals
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools that care for poor students.
The demand is, possibly, the last weapon available to the union, of the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke redundancies.
Sixty-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that the union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund by working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a hearing in the City Council last month, the Education Adviser, Dennis M. Walcott, said the dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council countered it by saying that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff would be fired.
Municipal District 37 officials said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the application, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The demand will include Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as accused, and there are eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all black women or Latin women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, since they had been underfunded in a chronic way.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 schoolchildren lost their jobs in the 23rd District in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in the 8th and 9th Districts in the South of the Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each enrollment by poor student in schools.
The union also states that the directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by language in a memorandum that authorizes the dismissal of parents coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "exceeding" to describe the action, although "exceeding" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school payroll to a workbag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were dismissed," says the complaint draft, "and not just in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muamar el Gadafi to be captured and killed, and for the participation of the United States to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "valence".
"This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya, when they begin rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for its democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought with each other and with the White House on drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorising the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never got voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the camera also rejected a measure that would have cut the funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress sufficiently upset to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not as angry as to actually reap the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs " congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "gives praise to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their partners in the coalition who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it divide the legislators as the June Bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the main Republican of the committee.
Lugar spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budget balance only in the House, and another fist that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially newly-wed Republicans who seek to refine their curricula - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote for an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can fulfil, while representative José E. Serrano (Democrat by New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat by Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment that prohibits homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits flag burning.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that members have been proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly presented more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was indeed proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat by Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with Broadway melody "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from front to back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the House by surprise to issue his triumphant vote in the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "That's good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special "20/20" hour-long program, which was released on the eve of the publication of the new couple's book, "Gabby: A history of courage and hope".
The special program analyzed Giffords' recovery since the 8 January shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her shaved head and a long scar crossing her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband cheers her up.
Months later, you see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while the therapists teach you how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A rustling of the lips.
And then his first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "totada", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: You see the congressman singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who has been on therapy for two hours every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords an article of the newspaper about the murder of March 12 when she arrested him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
Suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being medicated by force while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that in a moment of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, ''Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'' said Kelly.
"You've only been beaten.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back with more strength than ever."
Troops make me feel worse than respect.
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marine children broke into their posts around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They showed them like a sort of orphaned child," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been taken over by the military and an American audience often distant, sometimes adoring.
The troops are praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were sorry for the uniforms.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon depart to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the audience they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the pity talks take place in silence and in private among veterans of war.
After their two children returned from fighting the Navy Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be a "wrong and violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly whether he would be able to endure under pressure from demanding Washington work immediately after his fight tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian recalled telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The achievements in the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that is unfamiliar with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were completely common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The Army faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic audience will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their supposed passivity to rape.
Otherwise, hundreds of plaintiffs are being organized for the next one.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was headed back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a 12 cans beer package.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
"It's an alarm signal," says Lyman.
However, the native of Texas put aside her concern.
I thought, no, it's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, throwing her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and old military personnel eagerly await a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the claim they have against the ex-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the demand initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claim that they were sexually raped or assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed in investigating, prosecuting, or providing adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he goes to the army's biggest plane, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from top to bottom," he says.
"Who are the people who are able to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Its strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defence, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued by present or old soldiers for the injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a judgement of the 1950 Supreme Court called Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by staff in active service.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiff's military service," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time for the army to modernize, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are under way, in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Legal Services Clinic for Veterans is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a demand against the army that focuses on diagnoses of "personal disorder" assigned to victims of rape in order to release them from service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a complaint in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing him of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefits claims for persons claiming to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Abuse and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the attacks are remarkably below reported , and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which account for approximately 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 incidents that took place that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the reported cases in the army were brought to trial - half as much as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case, describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he denounced the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of her rape 11 times different from a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and the blood of her assailant - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended an audience before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared themselves as witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work--I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatry unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That was not his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 it was exempted from the service under less- and less-honored terms, which prevents it from receiving any benefit.
As for whether the case presented by Lyman and his peers in demand continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law School.
However, he says, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as responsibility.
And he adds, "Probabilities are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go your way, Burke, lawyer of the plaintiffs, will put his other hundreds of plaintiffs in line for future cases.
"Let's keep fighting the army on this subject until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivk was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having killed in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of his time before his attack on his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to get on Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report on European digital populism by the UK study centre DEMOS.
The flow of personal information on Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision - the way sellers have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then they gave them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon reaching Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing an investigation," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry about immigration.
However, in a sort of turn, "those who combine their activism online with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating an increase in research, boosting the number of academic jobs with the site name on the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study the people you could not approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very hard to identify them."
"You should go through the party, and they would never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all that--you go to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues, found that university students who talked about their rubber feats on Facebook had a significantly greater risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counsellors, could control the site and intervene to help a student publish too many state updates with their drunks.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development Center at the Seattle Child Research Institute, Washington Post said.
"We've found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinking" its own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the prospect of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders have long claimed that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, liking them or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to undermine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, on a 2006 study that conducted with the public student Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of a user's profile information and wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do out of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That is why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a hat and a pen are still the best research tools no one can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social research is still going on offline."
"Friendly and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Temple Knights of Norway," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, since it received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I do not declare myself guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he was locked up.
They all attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor to the Norwegian station NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mental illness, and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a victim's relative.
"It would be much easier if it seemed."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, are shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in an interview with newly rediscovered Jobs that has been dusted out as advance of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the commercial processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a young man of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series The Triumph of the Nerds on the dawns of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At the time, Jobs had been forced to leave Apple for only 10 years, and he was already working intensively in his new NeXT computer company, awaiting popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs died that a complete copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This archive material, slightly reedited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview, which arrives at the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate deep interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points during the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Job's perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient because of Cringley's questions, pushing him to go faster on the issues or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see doing right and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs' career, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the dreamer anxiously at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers they give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way you do it."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings in detail their efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disappointed by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good cover, and then adjusted to a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that the commercial costs could be determined in detail.
On the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make free long distance calls.
It has been written widely about the device, but Job's euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describes how he and Wozniak tried the box by using a public phone, making one call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half a dozen times and shouting through the public phone and returning a minute later to the public phone next door," Jobs says with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think there would ever have been Apple without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the US diplomat, the two broke into carcasses just before the Pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the telephone guide and called for spare parts to build a frequency counter.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made".
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a little cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for her.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he was dedicated to selling a handful of base plates, a customer asked him if he could mount the whole equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they shouted to me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I crawled out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble into his vision, and lose control of his market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make photocopiers and printers better, so what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so these kinds of people who end up driving companies and people in charge of products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position is rotted because of people who do not have the notion of good products versus bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't do that make the electrons, the glass makes them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end everything is reduced to taste - it is reduced to trying to expose you to the best that a human team has done, and then try to adapt those things to the things you are doing.
Picasso said the good artists copy, the great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing big ideas.
What made Macintosh big was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas eat with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met in private to consider the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were given a dinner sponsored by the signature of lawyers who would present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to study carefully the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a demand from 26 states challenging the total reform of health care approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit the application and, in fact, a historic claim of 5 and a half hours by March is expected, and the result will probably further disrupt the 2012 presidential career that will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be discarded will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush's government.
Clement's firm of lawyers, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another signature that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Affairs.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Code Canon 4C, which says, "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, even if the judge cannot be a speaker, an honored guest, or appear on the programme of such an event."
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was sufficient to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This striking gap of ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who judge the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were hired in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in fund-raising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticisms that say they mix court activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a leading conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as to be impartial now.
Kagan has given no indication that he is going to do so.
Boeing receives a record request of 18 billion dollars
Emirates Airline requests 50 Boeing 777 double-pass aircraft, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than one billion dollars.
It is rarely news when a company obtains an order of 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. planes and the selling price for the 50 planes amounts to a record of 18 billion dollars.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing from future orders of planes.
In a study on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest order in the history for commercial aircraft worth in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 double corridor.
The successful request came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at Dubai Air Hall 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Dihora analyst.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay the planes, but a rise in fuel prices - usually harmful to the airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the increase in oil prices.
That is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, said Dihora.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The request of the Emirates solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide-ranging fuselling aircraft market and helps to keep the airbus SAS competitor's attempt to invade his domain with the passenger plane A350.
Boeing's victory at the air fair took place four months after Airbus said he was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the start to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in the payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón states that drug traffickers helped their PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the competition for governor.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy to Michoacán's governor during the violent state elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers helped to tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results led the race for governor of the Western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview one day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they took over the polls, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until he lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the scene of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have surpassed Calderón, who had led the pre-election surveys.
Calderón, a candidate for the conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently in the position of governor, remained third, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the presidential elections in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderón, and numerous candidates left local applications for fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the elections of Michoacán appear, a victory will help drive the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, towards next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare themselves to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, CEO of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two largest growth economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic block either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "impartial" way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," said the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
Over the last few days, Italy's debt costs have gone off dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased the fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for key emerging economies to join together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as buying the EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater negotiating power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall in exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital entries.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when facing their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor of Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the one billion two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million live with about two dollars a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not turn out well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous well-paid workers of the Greek public sector at poorly run jobs and generating losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis is threatening "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 percent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing the "dangers at the bottom" due to Europe's threat.
He said that the vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant outflows of capital from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defence cuts
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, heated Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts that are combined could undermine national security and cause a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to the Afghan battlefields, to the civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion of reductions over the next decade, but now it fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that can be imminent if Congress cannot reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "sequestrian", would give rise to 23 percent of global reductions and a high to many new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects cannot be executed - three-quarters of a boat or building cannot be bought - and seriously damage other efforts to modernization," Panetta wrote the senators.
"We would also be forced to set off many of our civil servants unintentionally and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage good disposition."
The cuts in time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"While funding for wartime in offshore contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be adversely affected by the serious disturbances in the base budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and monitoring of the war-supported contract."
"The payroll staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defence would cause a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firmly against this draconian action," Senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not an outcome with which one can live, and certainly is not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of United States national security, and should not be allowed to happen."
If Panetta's letter and recent senators' warnings increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts are to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, despite having come to work at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that she was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morals, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential opponents."
"In fact, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions " generate important operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed before all over the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat boat and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Detaining F35 development and additional evidence could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say that it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent lies and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment charges with several women; each party is accused of lying to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that said a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolás Sarkozy was "picked up" with an open voice saying to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamín Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
Congressman for New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the joke with his dissidents quickly refuted by irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with infringements in funding the campaign related to the covering of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one living it will ever forget the media circus directed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps are widely spread in school and university exams.
There have been cases in which teachers have given student reviews in order to be better viewed in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lies and deceit are acceptable.
How much deceit do we find?
Any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that the unknown lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to say: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge would be based on scientific data obtained over the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been refuted.
The liars do look in the eye.
Not always tartamudean, bluffing, rustling or restful.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or expose.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I spent several years exploring scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigate through our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or negotiating management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, handling their own emotions and feeling intuitively how others perceive them.
We know from research that outtroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-orientated" lies, while women say more lies "orientated towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently than those who are not married (but the lies they usually say are "enormous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty when you lie to him.
How do I know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's usual behavior.
This is called creating a basic line.
Helps provide benchmarks to measure later changes.
Watch the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristic.
You better know if someone usually hits his foot all the time to avoid making unfair accusations when he sees his feet banging in the middle of the meeting.
Then seek misleading, verbal and non-verbal behaviour groups.
Consider these behavior groups as alarm signals, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember its history, can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change their posture significantly or exhibit a "post-interview disorder" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all difficult questions have ended.
Questioners often falsely point out that the interview ended only to seek that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson kicked his foot to the bottom and used the past while he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a distant language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... until I... understand it."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by the scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline diverted after the threat of the U.S. delay in its adoption
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating trade unions, while pacifying environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says that it is willing to redirect the project to redirect it.
TransCanada said Monday night that the planned pipeline will move out of the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's CEO, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until further potential routes were studied that would prevent the areas of the Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater.
"This is a real path of progress," said Representative Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State may set aside any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and expressed his full support.
The pipeline of 1,700 kilometers would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
For that, it would be necessary for him to cross six states.
It is hated by the environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to the plan are suspending legislation to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said the department's general inspector had ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to throw up fear
A New York family claims that the record music diva, Patti LaBelle, acted like a madman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, landing her little daughter to the point of she vomited out of fear.
The diator of "Lady Marmalade" scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, so much so that he suffered "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "he increased his fear of strangers," says his family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when Tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Boulevard Riverside building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes, and I took her," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman that she was angry.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J in a loud voice...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle came across the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surroundings and retired from a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but he did not get an answer.
Lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return the calls to comment on what had happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damage, but family attorney Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and the family plans to donate all the money he can get to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is directed to a kindergarten teacher who holds an 18-month-old child in arms."
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, a self-denominated change, which generated great expectations for progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, growth is not observed, but there is a deterioration in the main economic development indicators.
Low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the opportunities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of overall economic activity of 3.6% in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of ice cream damage issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was caused in 582,000 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main sinister crops were vegetables, maize and stew.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, as during January to March 55 thousand 053 signoans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, by the second quarter the rate became 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in numbers of people is dropping to more than 74 thousand unemployed signoese, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Less Liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, unemployment growth can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have taken since public policy.
"What is being seen is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation adopted at the congress to combat money laundering, already for people who take dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Organisation
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in rising unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because they already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality prevailing among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in the state works without being contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour demands is low wages, the institution has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Secretariat for Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the signanoese workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located in 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED Contraction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the highest decline in Direct Foreign Investment for the last 10 years was recorded, according to the State FDI Economic Secretariat from January to June amounted to $630,697, representing a fall of 87,74 per cent compared to the $5 million 143,000,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the State Government's Secretariat for Economic Development accounts for a total investment of 17 000 280 million pesos per year, mainly from third-party companies.
Debt
In the context of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested in July the state congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, even though investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business sector representatives, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, failed to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the ice creams of early years stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including ice creams, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn back fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows you to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore at the end of the year we are closing much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Oriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, stated that it is necessary to bring the state into productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the state's vocation and economic direction is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be done
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that best addresses the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been trying to achieve good results in various areas, there are some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way it conducts public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say is that there is work done and I believe that the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
They're condemning him for 8 kg of marijuana.
Five years in prison and 100 days in fines was sentenced to a neighbor of Navolato for the possession of eight kilos of mariguan.
The Attorney General's Office of the Republic reported that the convicted drug user is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of mariguan possession for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80th post, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcoenudist circulated in a pick up, white truck, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and in the copilot seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person continues to remain in the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Must contribute to works
Social works envisaged in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk of failing to comply with the Government of the State with its contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes is nearly 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that until now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of these works is in effect.
"It's almost 12 million of what's going on for them, and even though the year is about to end, we haven't been given a fifth, when since July they've had to give us a share," he said, "we've started the works and they're going very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State failed to comply with their contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a claim to cover the more than 7 million that did not provide for the State administration on that occasion.
"It happened to us in the previous sex year because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State had left behind," he said.
Despite the State authorities' commitment to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite efforts to ensure that their corresponding percentages are reached as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million what's about to give them, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth."
Corte valida "analog flag" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree advancing the so-called "analog flag" from 2021 to 2015, not gathering the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected because it did not reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remained in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and of reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and in admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The full ministers decided also to dismiss the demand put forward by the House of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the President said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure the measures for the preparation of the public administration through general rules.
"I also do not consider that if I did so, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected", and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the federal executive, who has the constitutional mandate, the state directorate.
Replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years, and it translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
To postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "may cover economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the whole established system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the power of the state executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the executive, despite highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, which somehow invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, is being provided in the administrative field the observance of the laws issued by the legislature, was ensured.
They analyze the possibility of a voting vote in Michoacán
According to the data drawn by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, although the votes for 879 of the total 6 thousand 74 records are not recorded.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in relation to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data cast by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, just November 9, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, even though the Congress of the State passed the reforms shortly before the legal deadline was completed so that they could enter into force in the current electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication within the time limits set out in the State Official Journal Act, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the Local Legislative Power and called as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state representative on constitutional reforms, although he has no right to "sanitary or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", Maria de los Angeles Llanderal stated that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the EMI it will be possible to make partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given on the assumption that: the results of the minutes do not match; there is no record of the balloting and counting in the file of the box or not open to the chairman of the voting box; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations in the records.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the voting boxes may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate who wins the election in question and who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition who postulated the second of the candidates indicated.
The total count of the vote may also be made if the difference between the alleged winner candidate and the second one is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that the express request by the representative of the political party whose candidate was second is made is made, where the electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation there is the choice of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 percent, although without accounting for the votes of 129 of the total 923 minutes.
His last will
Its ashes will be scattered in Zapalinamé's saw, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during Monday, there were recognitions and a requiem Mass.
According to his family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes were scattered in Zapalinamé's saw.
After receiving a tribute to the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.

Felipe Bacio Cortés went very young from the city of Saltillo to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said it even dizzy in the truck; however, he always tried to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "I was barely in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, like the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his family, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life — piloting an aircraft.
Give him the last goodbye
With honours, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was dismissed in honor of the head of Governor Jorge Torres López, who gave him the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, directors and students of the Technology of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and stood out both in the study and in the sport.

They locate three abandoned corpses on the estate of Cadreyta NL
Hours before the finding, the military authority presented to the media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed in bullets in different parts of the body and with the shooting of grace, on an abandoned farm of Cadreyta Jiménez municipality, Nuevo León.
The finding happened in the 1.5 km from Cadreyta to Santiago road, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.

All three of them were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three persons would have been killed elsewhere, as no shells were found on the site.

Wednesday the new Italian government will be formed
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of the economic disaster
The so-called Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the edge of the economic disaster and has put the whole eurozone at risk.
A press release from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take over.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "Marco is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the beaten confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronal Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to come out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly driven by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced by the crisis to resign on Saturday.
"We believe Professor Monti's efforts are meant to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the right-wing party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the majority technocrat government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure to warn that a failure in Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started his consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups on Monday as well as with youth and women's organizations.
It will end your round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections are moved forward.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the big parties insist that it should be formed only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process bound by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties is making the attempt to include political figures difficult.
The rock of the Spaniards is superior to that of the tics
Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of the 22 summoned arrived at the 50 meetings.
A mausculine contrast to Costa Rica, if compared to the 22 countries summoned by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., in the San José National Stadium.
While world champions and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a broad record of class A interselection games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one with 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the party against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity year in league championships and domestic cup, and high-level collisions in European cups like Champions League.
The above is added to the experience with Spanish Fury in complicated Eurocopa and World Cup eliminations.
On the contrary, tyco footballers possess a limited international rock in an area, such as Concaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the best record of the Spanish Selection is by the archer Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today before the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, brain wheel of Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized last week by UEFA together with the other hundred years of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ariete, Raúl González with 102.
Nearly 100th is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artilleryr Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five were over 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't close at 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar owns only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
The historical taster of Spain is David Villa, with 50 dianas, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that records more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on his two decades journey tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also be to make reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was assured by the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two decades-long working tour and will make its only scale in Central America on Sunday 20.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, beginning at 7:30 p.m., next to the angelic band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're gonna be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I wonder why there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the days before.
What do they say to their most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played during the last 21 years have happened for the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this set us up for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great surfing places; that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and different repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this for?
I think it's partly because we have nine disks and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we've been not playing, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because we remember the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've accomplished?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us can imagine that we would be on a large rock band and have done it for more than 20 years it's seemed like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are thrilled that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunt?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is somewhat unusual.
From time to time, a band of a city emerges, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands go out at the same time from one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we're lucky to be friends of all of them still and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange that a band like yours will stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameroon) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give each one freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don't get too busy because it's easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and the people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brought it, without getting encapsulated for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andy died.
There were many frustrations because it would last so long and most importantly is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think about the incredible person Andy went and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and so much more.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The Las Robertas national band will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do Yellow Ledbetter's letters always change live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are their influences?
They're so many.
Among the first things that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and has now become more positive.
What is this change due to?
It is interesting because I think there are a couple of songs in the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs though they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed by the loss of muscle strength on his legs, his chief physician reported.
Fujimori, 72 years old, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several illnesses, including a cancer in the language for which he has been operated four times and which is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the television channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, said he does not want it because he is known innocent.
It was operated four times of cancer in the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms to which other pathologies such as severe erosion gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems have been added, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving prison since September 2007 at the National Bureau of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people in the hands of an army annihilated squad who operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican couple, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proprietary for the exchange of information in all political affairs between the two nations", as the South American Presidency published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French representative Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20, a group composed of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world since November, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has in recent years tried to speed up the creation of fiscal exchange agreements in order to exit the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigotudo fountainer passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tireless, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of evil Bowser, but never had so far done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which reaches stores all over the world this month, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without needing to use glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopic without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage the least skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to take a "second round" to the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users can choose in real time between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also involves the character's return to a portable console, which had not occurred since 2005.
In this Nintendo video game, the followers of the saga are slants and repeat the formula for the success of the previous deliveries, consisting that the moustache fountainer will have to resort to mining platforms of danger in order to release Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new developments in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom supports the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he gave the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the US $70 million wash conspiracy.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called for Portillo to judge it there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account the fact that a court of judgment had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he did not "put his hands" in judicial resolutions and gave proceedings to all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Strada Morales and Victor Road Walls, both for drug trafficking.
The act by Colom implies an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to prosecute the ex-commante between 2000 and 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and of the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has dissolved his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the breakdown of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process before extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in marginality of untrained boys
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this fourth century.
This is added to the hundreds of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary was held yesterday in an event held in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradation or in a situation of marginalization.
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the act was attended by former adviser of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current Ecosocialist councillor Richard Gomà.
They also visited the large Fabra and Coats Hall, the current advisor to Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is, too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set an example for Trinijove to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Unlooped an occupied farm where macro-fests were made
The invaders had taken 11 of the 13 floors of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm on noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare of the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday afternoon voluntarily the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro-fests that were desperate for the neighborhood, in court order and without need of police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeated.
"From now on there will be access control," said the administrator.
Okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the crowds parties, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for the lodgers.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the disco points out that the invaders on the farm made him unfair competition, since they sold the drinks to three euros, while at the disco are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had had to respond to neighboring complaints by noise, while, it pointed out, the customers of the discotheque did not provoke them, but the inhabitants of the okupada house and, above all, the participants at the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in the last few weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the club explained that the nuisances were so great that it even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that "forgive him" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that during the last few weeks it had received more complaints from its neighbours about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP at the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "displace immediately the building to end the problems of coexistence and civics that cause the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant in the occupied building, but in recent months the Okupas had been entering all the plants in the building and on almost every floor, and that in any one of them there had been thefts.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and to be powerful against the incivism that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mosss evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., the police headed to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the occasion of the call beyond polemics about fees
The municipal competition on 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 1980s, at the height of the already-extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotion pasquines of Collserola.
The booklet defines the mountain as the large park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was once again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few who are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalis on the role of Yogi bear.
In these were until, in September, the city called for a megacompetition consisting of 16 contests for so many other gates of access to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, no doubt.
Or that or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both because of its purely organisational nature and because of its reflection on the city, is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost already a recurring subject to which to shake hands when two members of this former caste of elects are recognized in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Model and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coast front "it is necessary" to debate about "the mountain front", whenever the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, the one of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It can start from the basis that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "the gates of Collserola" encloses a "lexic trap": it is not to think of them "such as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where to act".
MODOL, such as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal of "intellectual network" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from "the fact that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and that it had in the area of the Forum "its chant of the swan".
The first fear is the delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
"To limit something is to set the next step," that is, its overstep.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referred to the Metropolitan General Plan (MPG)] can lead to real disasters."
More relevant to the question, Model feels that, by simplifying, the valley side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographical question.
Model recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "must not fall into a broken bag", although he thanks the opportunity that the council offers to its guild to intervene in this project "from the very first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile is the one that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", points out) that they have had to create: "The architects should be just a tool".
Bayona implies that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because at the bases of the contest there is a global vision of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-sectional contests -dice - in the sense mountain-mar, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can crash into program and definition with that of the architect at the door next door.
In his view, the council should ensure that the strip immediately superior to the Dalt Round should, throughout its extension, provide for an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and will come out free
After 72 days of rooting, Casino Red's legal owner granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that followed him for alleged blackmails
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal officer of the Casino Red granted him forgiveness to the District Criminal Second Court, which follows a blackmail process against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic contribution so that the city council would settle down to allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the bread mayor and on 2 September was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Officer 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Root 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
In that place it remained for the next 49 days after a second order of roots was issued after the Public Prosecutor ' s Officer desecrated crimes of rocket and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadreyta criminal allegedly for blackmailing with one and a half million pesos to the owners of the Casino Red; however, only a few hours remained in the middle security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was ordered by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months of investigation proved sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the charge of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of it.
This Monday, Casino Red's legal attorney, Victor Aldo García Gómez, went to Judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the mayor; so in the coming hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceeding, the Public Prosecutor's Officer, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the members of the betting house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the case 197/2011, legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and, subsequently, no claim may be made concerning the process followed; in addition to the need for compensation for damage or punishment.
Following the hearing of the legal officer of the betting house, about 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
It shall also notify him of the order of immediate liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more people
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Government Secretary, Francisco Blake Mora, lost his life, and seven more people, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot could attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were the right conditions to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the terrain, the quotes had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so he had the necessary requirements to transport staff.
In addition, he said that in the research done in the impact area, there is no report of the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search there are reports that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it was a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, research can last several months, even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff operated at cruise speed and that this happened on an ascending soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the TBS holder Pérez Jácome listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical normability the flight was performed under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew should have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports at the AICM provided adequate conditions for take-off, as the aircraft moved towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, they presented layers of low-level cloud.
Selected paths:
It is likely that under cloud conditions the crew has sought a less elevated area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of remaining parts of the aircraft in a small area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and side-by-side path.
The aircraft's residue dispersal pattern makes it possible to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the disaster there is still no evidence in the remains of the ship of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work pieces of the aircraft have been found at a elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the sea level, the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was expected to disarrange throughout this journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the site agreed, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the presumption that the impact was presented in structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find gene of obesity
Directs Social Security research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS) announced that it conducts a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, known as the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol, which will enable markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry, Hospital de Specialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvesav) from the National Institute of Political Affairs (INP).
The investigation invites the population to participate, whether or not they are entitled to participate, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out for minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the sports unit Cuauhtémoc (State of Mexico West) and that since 8 October, the activity is carried out in the sports unit Nezahualcoyolt (State of Mexico East).
Once the objective of gathering 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
At the celebration of World Diabetes Day on 14 November, he stated that the objective is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and hereditary history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He noted that Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure intake, glucose levels determination, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (it is sought to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys noted that in just six years, there was an increase of 77 percent in obesity in children and 47 percent in girls; there was also a dramatic increase in overweight," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for finding the markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the integral evaluation of children, which allows them to detect if they present any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) in the neck and forearm, indicating the probability of metabolic alterations and even predisabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who are told each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle they must make in order to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic suffering: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, to stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and to use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugared beverages, carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, burgers, et cetera) with high fat and protein content and the genetics that are analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would prevent berries
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemicals, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the floor were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 berries each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt floor is the right one, the berries could be reduced in quantity or even completely eliminated.
At his conference A technological opinion of the berries, dictated within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of berries.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight ones, called asphalts, and others low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the floor their characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes broken, added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but that it is changing during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher observed that most streets in Mexico City are covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that makes up the folder, pointed, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread themselves very well on the floor.
In the case of modified asphalt, the chemical engineer was of the opinion.
On the asphalt folder, a last layer called a treadmill is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that also bathes in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the way.
As part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the tread folder also needs to have the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground is wet, the water is spread inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a re-supply of all layers of the floor and therefore the formation of berries.
In the process of forming a bache, he said, the first to wear is the rolling film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with proper maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of berries and therefore the thickness of each of the layers of the floor must always be related to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, in order to avoid frequently forming berries.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already in the market and allow to repair berries easily and without needing to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 of Princess.
Once again, the Valle del Cauca remains with the desire of the crown of Signorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform to being on the podium of winners, polishing the silver crown and band that believe her as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic Lady rose with the crown and the scepter, the department has already added 14 titles of Princess and Melina to join the legion of Vallecacan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcès Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcès Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many are asking is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Lady Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles that got queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Signorita Colombia.
The first factor that is considered a key factor in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess lies in that she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is this book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gomez, of the Literary Cart Leamos.
The interrogator said:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing myself, I definitely believe that the book that marked me as a child is "The Principle", is a quite profound book.
Today I read "Crimen and Punishment", is a book of universal literature that we all must read; and today I am reading Irene Nemirovsky's book, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The burning of blood."
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and second by not explaining in a specific way how each of the books he quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony he expressed himself calm and happy with the result "The universe is wise happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Beginning" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that in Valle favoriteism burned her.
A Bogotano journalist insinuated that by being the favourite, the ovation and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (the Oster gastronomy line, the vote of the public for the best handcrafted suit, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the zeal of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted in his first performance in swimsuit on the Hilton beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although both of them were safe, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum shown by representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "As at Home" program of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "sees that the candidate who won the most prizes during the contest does not remain queen".
In addition, Valle showed herself to the last very dodging with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Competition of Beauty.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her parents.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before entering the contest are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of its defects in the back and the fibrosis that was seen in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury precisely chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina didn't have the best body, that there was better, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth to me wasn't very well known, dropped points on the last day."
Meanwhile journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, believes that the error of the Valecaucacan was the surgical interventions that were performed.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
His body was never his strong and he was charged here."
For this award, which for the first time delivered the National Competition of Beauty, after the parade in bathing suit emerged a cruel Vatican which was accomplished last night, for it was said that this was the lace that Raymundo gave Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the fact is that Melina has since begun a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international agreements for the designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her
This was the work of the calender that identified Alfonso Cano's corpse
A lophoscopist from Cali went on to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4th, a lophoscopist of the Cali ITC passed on to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the chief of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", through the collapsing of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the ITC section, that week was the turn of "availability" to Elias González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to enter the jungle for more than five days to reach the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, the palms of his hands and feet.
The week of operation against Alfonso Cano alias to Elias warned him to wear clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he should identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected of being the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry the decactillary card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the corpse was found, he did not recognize it because of his physical appearance, since he was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a peasant in the area, wearing glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with a galtonian lens, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Elias compared the fingerprints of the body to those of the card.
His eye failed: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was the chief of the Farcs.
In search of the footprint
For a dictator of the Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Elias González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dictyloscopy is an accurate science, without margin of error, which can become a key to solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false ballots or have no papers.
We take fingerprints and search them in the database.
The investigator reported that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, for in that place the thief had supported his hand to remove a strong box full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the footprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints may also rule out or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
Recently they found a dead man with liquor bottles around him.
By means of the investigation it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a trace in the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it was the killer, it does place it in the scene of the crime.
One ITC dictivist explained that in the objects "the footprints are taken out with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches becomes a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective quota is made.
The "indignant" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti square to camp.
A large part heeded the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupa Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to enter again, under the protection of a judicial order, into Manhattan Square from where they were evicted in the morning and by trying to occupy another park of the Great Manzana.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a judicial order that allows the "indignant" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the square, we're going to install somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of his camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located in the confluence of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and property of the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured Ephe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization claims that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already been moved to support members of the movement and had tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zucccotti Square - which is a private property facility - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday, where the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed copies of that order at this time and even handed them over to the agents guarding the plaza, which caused "some small clashes," Bray pointed out, who denounced that some officers had hit the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting the members of Occupa Wall Street or applying "laws which were published after the occupation began or from prohibiting protesters from entering the park again with shops or other properties they used earlier".
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the protesters, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to reinstall themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The director personally defended the eviction carried out in the early morning of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which approximately 200 arrests took place and which was decided because the protesters were "violent of the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression".
The leaders of "Occupa Wall Street" also indicated that they plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months during the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special television Christmas
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a partner of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladista) Michael Bublé and other Canadian prominent, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appeared together with his then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding on a manger a doll that represents Jesus.
At the scene, Peters, a well-known Indian comic novelist who recently acted as a part-presenter for Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas has Canadian singer Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and which is not unusual to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "Zorra" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of falls that started in March.
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, even though the devastating earthquake that has taken place in a nuclear crisis has been the worst disaster the country has had since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo accounted for material losses in $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seemed to have diminished.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to pass page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at annual rate.
The record in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the rebound of the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by seism and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1%, as compared to the decrease of 0.9% in capital expenditure from January to March, the first retreat after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revolution of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites the use of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has aroused, above all, the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, trips and leisure activities.
The Shark's Stigma
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "valuable shelter" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the turbulent US forecasts, a privilege that weighs as a loss on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious downturn for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, focused their weak results between July and September on the contribution of yen.
As long as the markets remain under siege to the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower its guard.
"We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And, indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy highlighted that the main powers are being slowed down.
As it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area, even below the average, which is at level 100, fell eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens re-feeds doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to be entangled in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional Government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the one-hundred-day period agreed on in his designation might be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support further austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," said Papadimos in opening yesterday a parliamentary debate which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new executive.
A package with 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the staff disciplinary code and further measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message leaves no doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his visa to any letter of compromise to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still shocked by the impact caused by the order of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the major Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return "to Athens very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek wood still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a dominant place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades in the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "esence" said it is based on being an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the Fifth World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with 2015 horizon, and, "especially, in the one who aims to reduce the volume of people living below a daily dollar, with which the "burden of poverty" is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility," said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "guarant the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", would benefit from these loans.
They are "many achievements achieved" and "many challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit is set up not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to drive "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that it is intended that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that 100 million of these households will come from the poverty line at which they are sinked.
The momentum in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering manner" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofia as an "act of justice and recognition."
And it is that he described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience followed him a year later at the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link to this project was worth yesterday the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "poor's baker".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, I stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic kindness, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believed that microcrediters are "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries should work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded the "success" of giving "trust" to people "excluding those who all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present to a city that "opens its gates contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes electing the European President by universal suffrage
On the first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, there was no great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially, Europe's future had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider that the government's policy is currently too restrictive with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhilus Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe represents peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe."
This could be expressed in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly Wolfgang Schäuble idea.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball's on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the European Central Bank directive on the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce the weight of Germany.
Looking forward to calming the spirits within her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is not that she has tried to win at her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of sick death fraud
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and to give a speech on the subject, already recurrent since 2007, of combating social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the will to save rigorously, but still reminds an axis of the presidential right-wing campaign, most want to focus on sickness casualties.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private sector workers before they can take the fall.
In short, unless there is a specific business agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but which would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of non-remuneration in the event of a job loss (up to now, they have no shortage, compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority of them also put on the table the issue of fraud, this time geared towards the abuse of labour casualties.
"The controls will be significantly increased and if someone is discovered committing fraud, he will have to repay the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned by speaking at the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of the low-labour fraud.
In fact, since 2002, there has been constant follow-up to this issue and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have normally produced fruit.
The French are only inferring in the rest of Europe.
Let us look at the national figures in the first place.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), more than 237 million euros were paid in employment benefits in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, low-income subsidies accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008.
Of this amount, 46 per cent corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54 per cent is related to sickness benefits, amounting to EUR 6,200 million.
Therefore, 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day off for illness.
Another study, in this case of Sickness Insurance, indicates that in 2010 37% of disease casualties were less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and 1 month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate of work (both for health and other reasons) in France ranged from 10 per cent to 11 per cent, compared to 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 per cent to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Low-disease fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has resulted in systematic checks on sick leave over 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 cases, that short-term reductions were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11 per cent of the cases were "adequately adapted or unjustified; a figure starting at a total of 1.2 million was considered to be 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases were reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
No doubt, an insignificant figure compared, for example, to work in black.
According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent tax revenue losses of between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros per year, that is, more than the total cost of lower subsidies and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This was stated on Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament; he added that the hundred days that have been granted to his union government would not be enough to achieve that goal.
"To make efforts leading to economic recovery, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who gave his first public address during the opening of the debate on vote of confidence to Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, as "the country's stay in the euro area is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papadémos has planned that the public deficit in the country will be reduced "to about 9 per cent" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed on Monday his support for the measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not commit itself to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the Members of his New Democracy party.
He noted that he was in agreement with the deficit and debt reduction targets, as well as the fight against defeat, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of EUR 8 billion needed without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be sufficient and that it would not sign anything because of external pressure.
An expert committee asserts that euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized
Canadians are living in denial of death, as indicated in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they wish to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts in various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so that assisted suicide and euthanasia are permitted, when the patient raises such an option and has been tried to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada occupies the tenth place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the subject of death."
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, as indicated by the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Together, the highest rate in this sense is registered by Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive subject of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the federal government's position, which has already stated that they do not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or are not criminal offences, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with non-compliant persons or that they have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian people, who are in favour of euthanasia
Let us recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
In addition, 66 per cent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of the elderly or disabled have less value.
As for persons who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care for a patient, the situation is not so clear, as the authors of the report indicate.
In addition, among its recommendations, it suggests that the Criminal Code indicates that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canada's health institutions, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it is considered euthanasia and is subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because euthanasia is not limited to those who are terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" with regard to the findings of the report, which called it "a manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, particularly calls into question the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus denounces a conspiracy
Syria is getting more and more isolated
The partisans of Bachar El Asad spoke yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Bachar El Asad Syria was intensified, which, with Russia's support, resists it and denounces that there is a "couple" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have expressed support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdalá II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Asad to "leave power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For its part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts that Turkey has undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with regard to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
On the other hand, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that "the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime" has been strengthened.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, like Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to the repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesperson for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the Deraa region in southern Syria have already been killed, as announced by the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, as indicated by that NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem considers the country to be "progress towards the end of the crisis".
Moreover, he has reacted firmly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which in his view constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not flinch," he added, ensuring that "the plots against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from repression of the regime which, in his view, is confined to paranoia.
It is expected that a new extraordinary meeting of the League will be held tomorrow in Rabat to develop the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of opposition and the release of the demonstrators detained.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Serguei Lavrov, saw yesterday as "incorrect" the Arab League's decision, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti calls for time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time on the markets to train his team and to launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" to recover the credibility lost during the past few months of the Government of Berlusconi.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today he met with the unions and the employers.
It should form a relatively restricted office, consisting of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the Council designated.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence to Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt by a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and the bond market yesterday, asking for time.
In the "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that it is "sure that markets will be patient and will understand it".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then concern was imposed, in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should set up a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has emphasized that he would like to include "politicals".
The new Government will have to operate until 2013, date of the next legislative session, it considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain Parliament's vote of confidence before Friday.
Monti is committed to working, when he is in charge, taking into account the urgency and the aim of Italy 'recovering its role' in Europe.
A spokesperson for European Commissioner Olli Rehn has emphasized that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for further stringent measures.
The Italian "chief of the bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "as a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great incognita will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to put some €200 billion in state obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in developing a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, as stated on Monday by an American NGO specialized in atomic risk.
For the identification of the investigator, the International Science and Security Institute (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed its "wrong concern" for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
The economic problems of your company would have brought you in contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Subsequently, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well but also, according to a Member State to the Agency, worked during most of his career in that technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, as reported by the statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49 per cent, compared to a 13 per cent increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14 per cent overall increase in the number of crimes and crimes against religion.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these crimes and crimes have increased again," said the Human Rights First human rights organization, "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added one responsible organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and should strive to put an end to these abuses," he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in US federal law was inherited from the era of civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site modified the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" tab allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", that is, those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow you on the Internet.
This lets you know if you track messages, if you subscribe to new accounts, if you qualify as a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, as indicated to AFP Twitter's spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its instintive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the general public Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users have debated tweets with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity is going to help me follow some elements of my Twitter stream better," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Christian Social Coalition, which is in power in Austria, has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budgetary "gold rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign note of Austria by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure far above the maximum limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were to be reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay EUR 3. billion more in interest every year," said Christian Democratic Vice-Chanceller of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responded to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries of 26 October: in it, Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in an equivalent law.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt that type of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017 onwards, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP each year, while the regional states, as well as the communes, should submit balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 60 per cent by 2020/2021.
A strong crowd
Noda threat with a new intervention from the exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the marking of change if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we check that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historical peaks that led to the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yens per dollar to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually rising since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crises in Europe.
The dollar came back on Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the 105 yen symbolic bar, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was valued at about 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago, as it exacerbates the Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the revenues obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), noted Noda, who fears that the intensification of the yen roots the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in one year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the right measures", suggesting that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting in late October, the emission institute increased by five billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasury Letters, bringing to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of the funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the types grow, the bags leak
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis continues to affect European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of weaker countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges are sinking a little further in the negative area on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 hours, ACC 40 loses 1.4 per cent and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and in London 0.1%.
"In view of the new tensions in relation to the yields of loans from the most affected euro area States, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent earnings."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional runner at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market participants regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look in Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a margin of small variations, so investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized," Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reopening of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has remained at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 hours, the European currency was worth $1.3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that envisaged, in particular, the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types are more than 6%
The credit rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian obligations at 10 years of age reached 6.85 per cent, while the Spanish securities at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has taken time to the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of being suffocated with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in types ("spread") between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historic peak.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the expected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a reduction of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the real concern of economists.
Germany, for its part, has grown by 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate for an election meeting to be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the whole of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will double the electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing shortage of fossil resources will need to be alleviated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
Fukushima's accident does not alter any of these parameters.
For this reason, Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor of Switzerland, which aims only to build state-of-the-art plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite some examples, continue to be determined with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, restarting the construction of an interrupted plant following the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a speech.
The Berlin election will entail an increase in the price of electricity, a greater dependence on energy because of the increased need for gas imported, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, harmful effects will be noted.
You should meditate on the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind sector, which obtains 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to wind interference; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the wonderful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not show opposition by principle to that type of energy, as the surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 head jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and which can create non-movable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of most of these SMEs and the loss of the EUR 6 billion per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would charge an EPR designed to run sixty years when the manufacturer's collapse is planned?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miracle source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions, demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority which exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamenville.
Our team, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it caused no consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failings.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as did the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all the electric actors who want to build a power plant are studying it, the interruption of their building in Flamenville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let partisan emotions, dogmas and maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from a number of points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the statistics policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "the country of human rights" in France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the Journal Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "needs no foreign talents, workers or waitresses".
However, economic analysis is rarely carried out.
The question is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the guideline in 1976 stating that "90,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone set Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that the co-development will enable the "problem of migration" to be resolved.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular those who are not qualified, by pressing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and primarily practice professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
Poorly qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where training fails to meet staff demand.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country that lacks anesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants leads to a positive impact on the wages and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% of migratory flows represents a rise in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches 30 years of age will make a net contribution (less income) of EUR 150,000 to average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go look for the points of growth that were missing "with his teeth".
These teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it is only necessary to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to agree on this because, although invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, during the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the crowns in Greece.
Some may have thought that, in order for democracy to triumph definitely over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and as directly as possible.
We know, from Napoleon the Little One, that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough by itself and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palindia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruence.
You must reflect on this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now moved away and, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a high to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take out blows of effect, but a common exercise, of full right, quiet and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
All Europe is committed to the orders of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty regains the spirit of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for European economic governance.
So be it.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without living as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead end.
We must assume a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The revolution motivated by interest would not be sufficient.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "no contact" chip are general
The world hall of chip cards starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of non-contact technology, which allows you to pay for common transport or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units) and to represent about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour issued this year 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact.
In order to move the upper hand, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"There are two major French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically spreading in the future, among their customers, bank cards with no contact system," announced Gérard Nebouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which are essential for carrying out transactions.
"They're retreating."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Bank Crédit agricultura announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and June in Caen.
The iPhone will be equipped with about 200 customers and collaborators with a fund that allows the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, on which it had long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algel already "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence services reports demonstrate they are cooperating," he explained, without giving more details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who for a long time remained in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's cradle, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It is progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial and external intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and similar styles as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as a community of illustrious illuminates of interest.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect of the sharia, while its militants are engaged in the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter focus first on churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as often happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and there were 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect radicalises and abandons its northern feuds.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that caused 80 deaths in Jos and then another one in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular against the police-protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of these types.
In August, the United Nations headquarters became its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would range from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is disturbing to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency
With regard to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidency, voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more explicit statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
Often founded slogans are spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for the designation by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "by manipulation of their currency", a key issue in America exacerbated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, nearly drowns in an attitude that "disturbs" emotions.
He has called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains unheard of.
Reagan style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to interrupt his nuclear programme.
"If I go out elected, I'll stop Iran," he pretended.
"If Obama's re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations with respect to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-ranked candidate, shows for his part a shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "has tried to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Tejan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, for his part, he is willing to deploy the US army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also advocated Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy burden in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their ingenious dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of Iraq's "boys" and in their twists in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The people judge more positively Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is suspicious of military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The North Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a big pump.
Last Tuesday, over 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, at the opening of the North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Similarly, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have turned together the wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, it will reach an additional 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas each year to Western Europe through a first had 1,224 km to communicate the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded at the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, that is, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk about the possibility of building a third tube through the same route.
For Gazprom, the finalization in time of this enormous work presents air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, North Stream is going to allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening it by closing access to markets in Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe of energy, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to win its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that binds us organically," said François Fillon during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom's directors, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement coated steel to protect it against the anchorages of the ships.
It is supported at the bottom of the sea, an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines that date from the Second World War.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, by caution," said Jens Müller, spokesperson for North Stream society.
It was also necessary to stress the protection measures of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden's waters, but project managers gave up on it when they saw that Swedes were not prepared to allow a Russian state society to establish itself permanently in the sea off their shores.
"In case we fail, we will interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In case of escape, gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders find it unlikely that there will be a leak, since they have planned joints which, according to forecasts, will have an escape every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by a submarine robot, dragged by a vessel, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates through the inside of the pipeline.
In the form of a pure, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without need of any repair.
Gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
At first it is 200 bar and, at the exit of 100 bar.
Five companies have united their forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the stakes.
Germany joined E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to that company, for a period of twenty-five years renewable, all gas transport capacities.
"Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for gas pipeline construction has ended by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and by 70% with bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach EUR 7.400 million for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom alone takes the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
A valve, with 4.5 meters of height, forms the gas outlet door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million an hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, brand name card.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people the taste for writing.
It has an adventure air, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based on Milan, decided at that time to launch a notebook of design notes to the market, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, by then consulting the company, took care of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (top leather), which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, inter alia, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he was successful.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, up to 12.7 million units sold.
Far has remained the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, as the notebook attracts both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in bookshops, from Fnac to the small shops of the city centre, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with Moleskine's development: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard caps, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Enjoying success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer backgrounds... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in the fall of 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled people are looking for employment.
The XV Week for the Employment of the Disabled starts today.
Despite a determined public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Discouragement?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high as the average.
"However, there's still a lot to do."
It should be mentioned that disabled persons continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old (an average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent have not finished the bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared to 38 per cent on average.
That is, there are many issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set out in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6 per cent.
"We now reach around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, has decreased from 2007 to 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law which increased contributions has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among the large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees, compared to 82 per cent of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that generates this friendly party.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the outskirts of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after the gesture of resentment from his front against Turkey, the Belgian picker has nothing but praise for him.
"I am very glad for Eden, for its progress and because it is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's front responds.
As for the contrast between your presentations on your team and the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this party against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shield".
Don't forget about the pleasure.
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been your fan," he says.
This will certainly reinforce especially the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face " Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made his part reference to "presumptuous".
"Pride" for arguing "a gala party."
"Hand" also to verify, as "neighbor", that France "is again a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job," he said excitedly.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Blues towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You can see it in the next parties." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento faces great optimism for the party back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the game of going, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Selection, which has been leading since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the departure party (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not mark the valuable goal that would have given it peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked it out of the house."
But at home, in the luminous Stadium of the Light of Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal," said an optimistic but lucid Benedict.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance to participate in the Eurocopa 2012", however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz has been relativized.
Friday's tie in Bosnia forces Portuguese to mark and win.
Bosnians could get a tie, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked it out of the house," says Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't leave them time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
