It's started.
The police are looking for you.
Have you ever visited Boston?
Always go straight.
I'm the one who helped Tom.
It's extremely surprising.
Why do you always speak to me in English? Is that why I'm a foreigner?
I don't think Tom will be surprised.
I'd like a city map.
Tom was singing.
You think you'd never imagine killing yourself?
Why are you reading it?
This doesn't have to happen again.
You don't have to know why I did it.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
Pfirsichbaeumchen wants to learn beer.

Tom went to prison.
He's reading a novel.
There were a lot of people on the street.
You forgot to write them.

We need to help them.
You have a lot of enemies.
You look a little nervous.
You also ignore the most basic notions of science.
I guess it makes sense to go ahead and pay the bill now.
Have you ever been out with them?
Tom decided to slow down.
That would have been terrible.
We need to do our best to change things.
The boy was fixing a carp bench in the pond.

It's stupid, isn't it?
She wasn't your sister.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.
This object is currently exhausted.
Tom is very clever.
He won't believe what happened today.
Can I take a picture of her?
I forgot your name.
We're calling our dog White.
Sami was drugging Layla.
It is not the length of life, but its depth.

I helped him.
You're really annoying.
The rest is history.

I won't bother you anymore.
This box contains apples.
Can Tom do it for us?
If you have time, let's go shopping.
Are you back home now?
I thought I'd go with her.
Hey guys, I think I found something.
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
I can't trust you.

I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had fun.
It's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to her about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got angry.
I'm already old.
I have the dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English in a bookstore.

What would the world be without women?
They tell us some funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?

It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
Do you want to eat with us?

I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they're talking French.
Step forward.
You need to become more active.

He's smarter than him.
What will you do this summer?
He got irritated.
You know how to speak Shanghainese?

Say hi to Tom for me.
It's good to see you so happy.

Here's your picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to you at a conference.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom introduced himself soon for the lesson.
It's a little overweight, isn't it?
Who's the man playing the plan?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his drinks.
Search Google harder!
It's not the only problem of your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does he look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom the chauffeur.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.

Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot whether you drink wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I will give 50 thousand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay in the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated her.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a warm summer evening.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the keys to the car.
I don't really want to talk.
So it must be Argentine.
I really like my work.
I'd suggest you be more prudent.
She's shocked.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.

Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary's jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still sleeping.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.

It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?

Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
Scandalosis!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Watch your tongue.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in advance.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.

There are some books on the table.
Come at least six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.

Are you Mary?
After dinner walking on the beach.
Why didn't he go with him?
He's two years older than him.

Let's listen to the music.
I think it's dangerous for kids to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Bring it to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.

Tom was a lawyer.
The people here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it will soon close the beats if the food does not taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free tonight.
You think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you guys tied up?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrist.
You look relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.

She's making me throw up.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock's broken.
I won't wait forever.
Just give the order.

He clearly wants to go.

How much do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom's talking to Mary on the phone.
Get some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one currency.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Take the picture.
You are my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where'd you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June isn't that far too.
Why does Tom hate you so much?
Do you know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes were wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you leaving me?
You always liked Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me questions?
Don't play with Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I've been taking risks.

I almost dropped the dishes.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom composed 911.
We're brothers and sisters.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
It was beautiful this week.
You want a tray with that?

It's a bunch of nerves.
Tom arrived late.
Tom stayed back.
This point will be discussed tomorrow.
How did you spend your vacation?

When did you get back from London?
Tom's always good.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom snooped for a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It looks so fake.
They're all dead.

Mary accidentally hit Tom.
I'm nobody's enemy.
I forgot her number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.

What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired, take him home, please.
May all your desires come true!
He already did.
He is experienced with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, right?
Now let's talk.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit him in the head.
It'll be a lot of fun.

It is a disease to be obsessed with attack, and it is also a disease to be obsessed with defense. It is also a disease to be obsessed with getting rid of the disease. Fixing your mind obsessively on whatever is considered disease.

I'm like my brother.
I'll go.
