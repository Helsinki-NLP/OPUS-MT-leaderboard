Whites: tower in a1, pawn in b6, king in c8. Blacks: pawns in a7 and b7, king in a8, bishop in b8. The whites put the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower in a6, after which the blacks will only have two options: take the tower in a6 or play their bishop for any other house of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and give mate. In the second situation, the white tower takes the pawn close to a7, with identical result.
