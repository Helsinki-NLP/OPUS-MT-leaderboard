Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American president of history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will receive them, inter alia, through the exceptional effort in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have much to do.
First, a visit by the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected him from 172 people to 33 organizations.
Later, the presidential couple are scheduled for a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth American president to receive it, although the third one to receive it in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will speak of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as President of a country currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts further increased with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During its full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will attend.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the prize.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochranc.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and in order to withdraw appeals demanded investors money for their own benefit, said the spokesman of the Litoměřice Alena Romová police.
The president of the Society of Natural Defenders Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently under arrest and faced with a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like the containers too much to separate the garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging from drinks and in the villages of southern Moravia they can find containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
There you need several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that in Brno we don't split up the garbage for nothing.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, municipalities are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is totally late in the separation of waste, not only by the fact that we, citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing a bottle of PET in the center to the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is at Moravské náměstí Square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't get mad at me Mr Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that elsewhere it is also not easy to separate waste.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
Non-vacancy
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw out several bottles of glass and plastic.
But at the Kaunicova Street, I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, on the tram I found the right place.
However, the trash was already stuffed with the container.
It remains the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extract, which shames us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little bit, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is indeed the worst in the whole region of Jihomoravský kraj.
The budget of "Paroubek" took money from the incomes and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's opinion, add funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for incomes, sickness subsidies or building savings.
But neither for the interests of State debt or international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they were assured that the government subsequently asked for a loan for sensitive expenses, incomes or sickness subsidies. "That means only deferring the problems for the future, it is placing mines," says Janota.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay higher interest rates and, someday, you have to return the money.
The State does not have many options to make money.
If you do not reduce social allowances or operating costs of the State, you have to increase taxes.
To everyone who added the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, so did your children.
People do not have to worry about sickness income or subsidies, they will receive them. Out of these accounts 1,800 million have disappeared.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year will not be lacking in the treasure only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to increase alongside interest costs.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocation of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, the next year will also be five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their prices cannot be reduced.
The most you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Karel Hanzelka Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mainly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year ČEZ allocated to the budget 18. billion.
Each year dividends settle ecological damage, serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
In addition, according to EU rules, this trick increases the real budget deficit at the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to grant various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, including in building savings.
It is unclear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
Thereafter, the Minister will have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, to take control of the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million missing for the Státní pokladna project (State Fund), whose price is two billion and has already been launched. It must allow you to monitor online what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Finance does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will arrive, Janota warns.
Your future smart phone will work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone where the user can switch between several operating systems by pressing a key.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just pressing a key, they spend a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of software virtualizer for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at a time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago proved for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
The VMware company cooperates with European and American operators to test virtualization smartphones and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only the teleski maintainers in Krkonoše are concerned about snow-free slopes.
Lack of snow makes people not book ski rooms in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of the Spindl information portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to pass in Špindler till Mlýn a Night in accordance with their expectations should no longer hesitate to book their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
Hotelers from Špindler till Mlýn offer mostly weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon yield and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura said.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what we are most interested in is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered remain free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas rooms," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer Christmas in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to spend the year in the snowless mountain.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will also be exhausted," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free spaces.
Interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the rooms in Nochevieja are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně in Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, as we find ourselves about sixty percent of the capacity to occupy.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as it falls snow, the interest for stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel Omnia.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hotelers in Krkonoše will be looking forward to the snow.
Thursday should fall temperatures and, if there are precipitation, in the mountains should snow.
But after again the temperatures will rise, said Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
US: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his expected Afghan approach, it was demonstrated that it is a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times the words "equal as in Iraq", but it also did not hesitate to use the title of the Bush declaration of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new way forward".
It was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, demonstrated that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that nothing of Iraq is spoken today in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however, objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than he might have expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The camp captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan General Operation Stanley McCristal. He, despite the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided gunmen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better happened, so at least he tricked the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama's whole strategy seems to be its goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to finish this procedure in three years. Obama's entire doctrine generated more questions than the answers it offered.
Many doubt that the increase yields the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is made.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the head each day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. Following it will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even to establish a state that is "capable of action", a minimum goal of the whole operation, seems very real.
Obama's strategy horizon is shocked by his volunteerism.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the soldiers sent to the war to "come home soon," will perform some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will view it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of developments in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not have any effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek answers precisely when, according to Obama, America initiates the triumphal withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic reversal to the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential elections and that is why there is still a lot of time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Bank leaders Goldman Sachs will never receive cash bonuses again
High executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced to respond to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares which cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to join the Wall Street bonuses with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest road to be undertaken, mentioned the former investor banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced the criticism of nearly $17 billion (roughly $300 billion CZK) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the institution for this year, according to Reuters agency, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a delicate issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to record at one time, with a tax of about 50 per cent, bank bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women received Nobel Prizes in all less physical categories
Five women, which is a record number, received today in Stockholm by King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes of this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in chemistry received it from Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last prize given, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his fellow countryman Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a prized woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This amount in each category is up to 10 million Swedish kroners (approximately 25 million Czech kroners).
In the case of several awards in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most expected Nobel, the one of peace, received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of having been awarded, as it is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if its price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps Janota's stay in the cabinet, are supposed to be the themes of your meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finances crisis.
On the appointment, President Radim Ochvat informed the spokesman.
Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer about her stay in office.
According to the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, adopted on Wednesday the proposals from the left for the transfer of funds and increased the money for staff salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of the Fischer bureaucrat, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics say that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, actually liquidates the savings package, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the State budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long been neglecting "the serious problem", that is, "the non-sustainable deficit" of the public estate.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is frightening and that the government should think of its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas said for ČTK that the concept of the bureaucrat cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words of "strong opinions."
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is amazing, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed the 200,000 million crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in the new film by Clint Eastwood, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, reports a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles play American actors.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid racist regime in the South African Republic and his first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by American Oscar-winner actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
Seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the movement leader for the abolition of slavery, who ended up as a slave, of the fictitious president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who united his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after the apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to join his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join rugby players, who belong globally to outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the movies.
I had no other goal to play this role in such a way that it was as much as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dine with him, be in the background before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that by pressing his hand, I received his energy, it was transmitted and had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon played the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players dominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his house.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look a lot higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the actors' characters and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talks about ambitions for Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the Rottentomates.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The Splendor's Secret on Resolved Norway: The Russians Tested a Missile · Global Voices
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence ended up recognizing yesterday that near the borders with Norway he tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, of the type "Bulava", previously destined to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or a failure occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulavá" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was at first no problem.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again on the equipment.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine, which floated into the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a ship that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulavá".
The Norwegians have not hesitated from the very first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by claiming that we cannot simply talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile were sustained and the damage occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines were discovered immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the releases went through completely without mistakes, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence, only six out of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost 50 percent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continue to claim that "Bulavá" one day will fly smoothly and will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total weight is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with Moscow's CSKA at age 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will re-present himself at 51 years of age for a professional hockey meeting.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will assist his Moscow CSKA team and possibly play Friday in KHL's duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash gets injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, quoted AP agency Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, it will become the longest professional player of Russian hockey.
The legendary front Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he was also successful in the NHL: playing with Detroit twice won the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Glory Chamber.
Hyundai met union requirements. He will cancel all the extra work
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Just because of the frequent additional work, the unions declared the emergency by strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai Automobile Factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, since it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary additional work for Saturday, December 19, i.e. work on two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on Saturday's shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or can take a day off on December 28, i.e. prolonging Christmas parties in one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees on Saturday's shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the additional work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management decided immediately yesterday afternoon to cancel all the additional work for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Car factory employees were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the management of the factory and trade unionists should take place on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kuchař trade unions said on Wednesday, that if they are committed to meeting the requirements and signing the document, they are ready to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation in the car factory worsened last week last Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went into strike for frequent additional work.
They also protested against bad payment conditions and the alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and to be able to supply cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the emergency by strike on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, last Wednesday, interrupt the manufacture, be punished in any way.
With regard to additional work, trade unions require that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year requires a remuneration of 5,000 kroner.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The series manufacture was started last November.
Until September last year, it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some accessible medicines already.
AIDS disease cannot be cured so far.
However, patients' lives may be significantly prolonged due to a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs will no longer work.
The work of the experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of dominating the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metalcarbons have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all the medicines used today, and that is why they can solve the resistance problem.
In his work scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of his link to the albumin of the virus.
Metalcarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedra cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are united by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the vital cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, the fractionation of the HIV virus does not occur and the virus would not create mature and infectiously infectiously.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, they explain scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Scientific Journal of Medicine Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are united by a short organic series, which remains systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
Evidence of the effect of this series of HIV protease substances was tested, and also against its resistant variants obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on clinically used medicines, however they do not lose its effect on resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes it interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Łezáčová, the head of the structural biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "surprising" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, he said, think of its future existence.
ODS statements were made by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say there's time for analysis.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether he wants to rely on the minority in the House, who is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Nečas warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the 2010 budget, but with the modifications by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for State officials' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the proposals of the ODS, as it covered the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the wish of the government, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of helplessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká TV Janota called for a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out, that he's thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is their disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, Nečas in the government has nothing to do with those nominated by the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, whether the chamber approves other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness subsidies, incomes, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not to blame
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, said Topolánek in the U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in lieutenant posts there are people who belong to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of struggle with the height of the deficit in the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is supported by the left-wing majority, who is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it cannot count on the support and tolerance of the members of the ODS.
I haven't thought about it, at the moment, I'll take care of it, he told the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies the defense minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of the ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a European Council meeting in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS yielded at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the modified budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly ask ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, we react to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
By resigning the mandate, he knew that in the following months it was mainly the Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all positive things, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new schedule of ČD trains will circulate fewer trains by almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less-used rapid and local trains and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most rates including basic and customer prices will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will, for example, win the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, Drahy for this line will add a pendulum road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will no longer circulate to Bratislava.
On the Prague line - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate fewer fast trains, will restrict direct links Prague - Letohrad.
In the regions, the biggest reduction in Drahy-planned transport is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and around.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced only to a few days of week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, around the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line of Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní Nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From December 13, travellers will no longer travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account for the regional railways this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive the year next four billion crowns in total, just like this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the next year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local Drahy trains they have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one-year.
Drahy is happy with the system, and maybe that's why they didn't raise the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will occur only on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine armed forces continue to arrest more than 50 people, the children were released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several pupils from a primary school and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 armed soldiers use hostages as a living shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, armed members belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously persecuted the kidnappers because of violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Magundanao was due to the recent killing, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the 23 November killing, related to the governor's elections, there were 30 journalists.
For suspicion of the involvement in the killing, the governor of this province was arrested in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuans.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, on Tuesday they renewed the peace talks with the Philippine government.
The history of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech esInvictus: Neporažený) was released in American cinemas, which captures part of the biography of the former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-known fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the role protagonist Mandela himself.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere comes the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Its full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. It was born on July 18, 1918 in Mveso, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa preparations for the world football championship are culminated. At the same time, the media are gripped by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the protagonist roles by Hollywood's "little interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman says, however, that he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well for it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, for - as it is said - to charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the holiday premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if we can remember Mandela's character and message through the movie.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it relates to everyone, it added.
In the national rugby team suit
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. He portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first electoral presidential period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to join two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts the South African national rugby suit and enters the playing field. RSA won at that time the world cup.
By entering the grammar in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially the white audience and the recognition of white inhabitants.
The football championship may help people join and form a nation, mentioned rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
You will still see, if you improve the tense situation in the RSA.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as he said in a recent interview for LN, a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lunsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught in the morning a transformer from the company Čeps in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lunsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firemen wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, however later changed their opinion and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokesperson, the damage did not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of the activity of Čeps did not happen anything similar, such failures are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the ČEZ company's voicer for northern Chechnya, electricity supplies were not cut off, and the electrical substation fire did not affect the functioning of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps Čobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the 400 kV electric drive and 220 kV.
Keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical power of the transmission system to the distributor system, and maintains the electrical drive of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a slanderous complaint to three Hetmans of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a complaint for slander to three Social Democratic Hetmans.
It is Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and the Hetman of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in 20 minutes on Radiožurnal.
The demand has to do with the company's effort, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with České drahy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we're "taking pasta", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České drahy, which is not true. We know the prices of České drahy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing left to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the society Student Agency, said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time having evidence from all regions, and he said that he did not take necessary measures in line with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other hetmans to do so too.
I suppose, which will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, said Hašek.
Jančura announced last week, that he would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would stop the Christmas campaign and want to continue after the New Year.
He said that the campaign would be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura began the campaign after the regions agreed with České drahy to maintain regional railway links and for the task of approximately 150 billion kroner did not convene a trend.
According to Jančura similar steps are at odds with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims that he has been threatened by a Member of ČSSD because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave it, we can lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of ČSSD, I know, what you are talking about, I am not going to say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As the first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that mandatory vaccines would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcals culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have already made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born on 2 August last year will be free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or earlier must also cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of the child's age.
Last year, part of the families voluntarily allowed their children to vaccinate against pneumococcals.
However, parents paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually on vaccines.
Without hugging they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent the entire vaccination of children approximately 500,000 annually.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
The pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of severe infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of the pneumococal infections in our country each year, 28 children not older than 10 years of age die according to hospital investigations.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumatic vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are views that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, head of the civic association Nahlas.
Its association has been propagating pneumococal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way that we now have to take, Kalovský mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against pneumococcals.
At this moment we do not think so at all, said his spokesman, Mr. Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the pediatrician society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékař the Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, it may be reasoned on the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand relatively the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect, that from the coming year more than 80 percent of young parents will allow their babies to vaccinate against pneumococcals.
The pneumococal vaccine is a great change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save then on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members were afraid, however, that insurance companies could "get money out of health insurance".
Doctors will have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that paediatricians will invest 40,000 vaccines a month, which is a significant amount.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 pictures on his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used a excavator to break into the museum, in the region of the Pocon Mountains.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of such characters as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzán.
The News Agency Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52 years old, declared to the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to transfer all pictures to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure cuts in the previous budget report, in the face of opposition criticism, companies and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "lost" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance was also severely criticized for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in social security expenditure and a 1% increase in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have regretted that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will grow about £3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which says that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
CALL POINTS OF THE REPORT BEFORE THE BUDGET
Social security with an additional 0.5 % increase from April 2011
Economy will be more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on banker bonds
The 1-point increase in company tax for small firms was ruled out.
Tax reductions for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5 %
According to estimates from the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 per year and who earns £40,000 will lose £ 190, while a person who wins £10,000 per year will win £110.
The Ministers said that their objective of halving the 2013 deficit involved "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall to 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that tax increases and cost cuts outlined were a "wheat in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the forecasts of the Labour Party regarding future economic growth, which will influence the level of borrowing and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Finance Minister was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably be going by 4.75 % this year, much worse than the decrease of 3,5 % forecasted in April, while the demand for loans would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Oopportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about "the debt crisis" of the Labour Party, said that the projection of borrowing applications for £ 789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how the money would be returned, adding, "scinically" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have included nothing significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
"All major announcements will be made after the elections, win whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction in the short-term deficit.
But the Democrat Liberals claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's expenditures, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "drain castles".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, mentioned earlier, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to allegations of electoral manoeuvres, as money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided most of their needs and will review the situation in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish expenditure data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Tax Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really putting away the pain for later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte's counters.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets realize this."
The FBI is investigating "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The American Embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that men were arrested in a raid at a house in Sarghoda, eastern Punjab province.
The FBI said it's investigating whether they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in Virginia state, U.S.A. last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States said it was also seeking information about men.
It is reported that three of them are from Pakistani descent, one from Egyptian heritage and the other from Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances they are being held," said spokesperson Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," said the spokesman.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said men were arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncles.
He said that the house was already in the local police's eye and that no charges had yet been brought against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on arrests, reported the news agency Reuters; but said the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International Condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been the same as disabled, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
dozens of people have been sentenced, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Jamene acknowledged some charges of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance towards criticism, according to our correspondent.
"Falsa confession"
Amnesty International quoted the account of Abraham Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the outcome of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face" according to their words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and he was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semiconscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the charges of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the malaise of the post-election and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the parliamentary committee's investigations were not made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the park of the city
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100 meters long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
It is seen below a beautiful view of the city's lights titling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
Awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After Thursday afternoon's event, the snow will be melted.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested a ban on the construction of minarets and a general warning on the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's last work "Why French people don't like veils" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These seeming worldly issues, he maintains, things of daily life, which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation seeks to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not able to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists whom Mr. Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategies (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defending secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives "a set of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most despondent panorama
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it the life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and the policy of whaling whales, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value facing the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the edge of his mosque, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The children, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one billionth of the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was greened by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis resorts to accounts from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and skimmed Indians use high-power assault rifles to bring down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After Ice" Alumn Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling story about Arctic science and a super-coking look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It's not for lack of commitment.
The pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave indications for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the submarines of the cold war drew a map of the motions of ice cord that circulate under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted in icebergs are a useful supplement, but hardy individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system inside the Arctic ice, consisting of saltwater jets that are compressed as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice withdraws, which is believed to happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us.
Marines among 6,000 who place crowns on Arlington's tombs
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, N.C., at the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who met Saturday morning to place crowns on veterans' graves in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, initiated the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel each year to different cities along the way, to conduct events dedicated to military and terrorist victims.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, the Worlds Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the commemorative site for Flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
70-year-old Charleen Hunt of Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a dead military career.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Surrounded in warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to the oldest graves of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they do not receive as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful as the children played and the couples took hold of their hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the shadowy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read loud names carved in the stones, while others bent to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who would wipe the tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He managed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the Sgto Marine Gunner's tomb. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. My son paid for it, he said.
"Many after my death I want someone to remember."
Cuban officials arrested a US government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who distributes mobiles and laptops in the country, the State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on client projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost anything considered "dangerous".
All activities called counter-revolutionary, including mild protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Graffiti anti-government and discourses are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has asked for permission on several occasions to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor may probably cause tensions between the Communist government of Castro's brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to spread the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the United States Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handfuls of American citizens in prison in Cuba are among bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly denied.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as free mobile distribution, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the programme of the Americas of the Human Rights Watch organization, who recently published a hard report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's location as leader of the country, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials draw a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, demonstrating that they hope that the case can help to unseason an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who use the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Researchers said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube Internet video site.
Saifullah addressed men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the Qaida commanders that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of an undercover operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity because of the delicateness of the case.
The official said that men did not change and were even trying to get adequate approval to access the camps of Qaeda, when the Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who are of confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence has put the primary priority in trying to infiltrate people within Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the Holy War, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said Qaeda analyses with special attention American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to have access to American goals and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with respect to those who admit, because American intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed? stated Kohlmann.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate action
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center, bolder actions for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding signs in English saying "There's no planet B" and one in Spanish saying, "The Earth says "it's enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru’s native country of his mother’s travels made me aware of the distressing issues with which the country must deal with due to the impacts of the climate changes that are already taking place.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
The police prevented the protesters from getting too close to Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or for wearing pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for involvement in climate talks, activists with sports masks and black suits placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as called, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention centre, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate into the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is great, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each one to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Data from evidence reveal persistent racial differences
The federal scoreboard last week on math performance was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best performance systems, the rating book showed that the fourth and eighth grade students were bullied at a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Education Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of the fourth grade white students in the DC over the last two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the difference in performance grew from 2007 to 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the eighth grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, decreasing a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not quite large.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between the fourth grade white and black students in 2003 when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to just 58.
Education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances made by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by caring for those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I am not jumping with joy for a difference of two or three points, said the Council member of D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's style of administration, said that the message of the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what is concerned is that we are not devoting the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of the higher grades of primary and middle school, who did not master the early reading grounds in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The everyday mathematics, a mathematics curriculum from Kindergarten to the sixth degree, which emphasizes games and experiences of real life, which was introduced into the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who was credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here's a kind of squabbling dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who is studying scores of urban tests.
The solution to conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important chronogram.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the middle black and white class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, are confident that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now a Newark School Superintendent, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference in performance is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
Almost 200 days must come to have the power of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, who considers himself as an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more future education
The tourist bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong breath.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had hardly graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the tuition costs $38,690 per year, their attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of potential enthusiasts.
Yes! This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously?, he thoughtfully said, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of teachers-students of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day journey, and had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to go to college.
The question is which.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Spain who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands of students who have access to the university education they need to enter the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduated from college, a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Its success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze those of higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programmes can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is deduced that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We need to consider providing a support network for these children, from the kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour of Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides over $300 million a year to local school systems, to run university preparation programs, which start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending the university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies moved away having climbed into only two of the 10 auctioned deposits.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who presented an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants in the opening up of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans in the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Petroleum Forum, an online news center.
It'll be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military retreats, probably prevented American oil companies from putting themselves at greater risk in Iraq, which has the third most important crude reserve in the world, said analysts.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and West Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The major American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handedly.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and obtained large investments in contracts for two major deposits.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, the spokesman for the Assam Jihad Oil Ministry said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the same time as its competitors and will comply with its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected for proposals made offers that were then confronted with the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each deposit.
The main planner of Qaeda has apparently been murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a alleged US missile attack on the Pakistan border with Afghanistan has killed a major Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somalí was one of the two Arab men who was thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the Waziristan Province of the North, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said an official of Pakistan's civil intelligence agency, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
The official said that suspected local militants rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify victim identities, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner of Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was dedicated to conspiring around the world, said a high official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of American air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to Qaeda's superior command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had rapidly ascended the ranks of Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat posed to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of Qaeda or Taliban leader murdered since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has decreased since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to a Long War Journal account, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspicious informants, the site said.
The UN's maximum shipment to Kabul about to resign
The United Nations maximum envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of corruption extended in the United Nations-supported presidential election of Afghanistan.
The exit of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said it supports the increase, but he is concerned that the US military withdrawal schedule which begins in 18 months encourages other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, working with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it's better to start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's exit and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek a replacement, according to United Nations officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission to Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led United Nations peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential vote of the country and of covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that the accusations of Galbraith, who was dismissed, "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already much scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said it proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also promoted the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase their confidence that their money was being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations to its powers in Afghanistan, claiming that the overwhelming UN recruitment regulations undermine its ability to capture talent.
This is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Defence Secretary, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, for their failure to engage in talks about their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, attached importance to the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that if we've learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictableness of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions directed at the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "believable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would once again negotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for this agreement, as a way of building confidence between the two parties and saving time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have strayed from the tempting agreements, in part, the experts claim, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of committing itself to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that actually accepted in early October, has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that has not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama made a deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before reconsidering other options, even continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "destructive sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday as "unfounded and baseless accusations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said it has the will to continue with talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was returning to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish oil-rich Iraq region, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the President of the Regional Government of Kurdistan: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a shift in course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby more means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed their way this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing left for a second," said 31-year-old Wang, a human resources administrator with an eight-month-old.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a single child's policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously reputable children, malevolent single children, affectionately nicknamed "small emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six when the policy was implemented, according to the Division.
Population of the United Nations, while the number of residents aged 60 and more is expected to exploit from 16.7 per cent of the population by 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is far above the overall average by about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cultivated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, has stated that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aged population and mitigate a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "so old (not so rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a highly unnatural male-wife ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their position on single-child policy.
In 2004, more exceptions were made to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 many of their hard-line slogans were reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing's Demographic Research Institute, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Nearly the morning, the posters that ordered families to have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very overwhelming.
Disappointment
While rural city officials in the outskirts of Shanghai claim that they have observed a moderate increase in couples ' requests for a second child after the campaign was launched, the most urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give your first child the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient medical and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they maintain, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West view the policy of the only child as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months from the first child of the couple.
Yeah, they're stealing from us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants a unique child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everybody taking care of us.
We are not accustomed to taking care of others and really do not want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two middle-class careers, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it is a matter of having enough success as to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up seeing their parents' struggle during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a long time from the parents, he held.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic "must have a curriculum prepared for the best daycare facilities when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has so far been characterized by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, attracted renewed attention on Friday with the dissemination of an ambitious document that foresees reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, with over 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Established by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not discuss how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in the temperature that political strategies would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's largest climate official, Yvo de Bóer, described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 from 25 to 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period from 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent around 2050.
The European Union also stimulated talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.600 million annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, Friday was presented the same kind of artificial verbal fires that dominated the talks last week.
The United States Special Climate Envoy, Todd Stern, rejected claims requesting mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared with volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, with respect to what the Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei said that the United States' largest climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, the lines of failure have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The present battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four countries of the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the strongest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are discussing who should cost the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive seeking to contain the major issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, Ulate supported, who also works as regional advisor on climate change in Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants said that talks would ultimately produce a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, prepared a proposal for a preliminary 24-page treaty early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks assumed a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues had to be resolved before the heads of government came to an end.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran to the Bella Center corridors, to closed meetings and press conferences, in order to be able to define the claims that will be arbitrate during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention centre every day, activists playing the guitar present night shows making fun of the countries they feel are selling themselves, and hand-in-hand preliminary proposals are passed instead of by mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues," said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President of the Global Policy of International Conservation.
The heavy weights are coming.
The first train at 225 km/h in Britain redefines that feeling on Monday
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to point out a train exit that marks a revolution for trips to Britain.
The country's first high-speed interurban train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like a ray from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first interurban service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the change of planes and cars to the railway would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as ease congestion on roads.
In theory, the three major political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and the fears of environmental damage, can still slow down Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the Midlands of the West will be traced within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 meters from a final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The favored option being proposed is a configuration with the form of Y, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Penguins to Manchester and Scotland, and another one heading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once finished, travel between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stretch, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 km/h, turning the British network into the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to support 400 mt long trains capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed to receive 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the restrictions on capital space, an existing station is expected to be extended to suit the high-speed network.
Train industry experts argue that only the St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is started, the network should be built in sections.
At first the trains would be forced to leave the fast lines by the roads in northern Birmingham, maintaining the travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Contributors face mortgage by an orange of £75,000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the voicer of the Conservative Party, received the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange who built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the deputies lived "of rations", increased his mortgage in £75,000 to build an extension framed in oak in his second house in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the moment and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said that the applications "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the planes as a "ranjal".
The neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent investigation by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges on his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an inquiry into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271,406 from his London estate to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
The documents circulated this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately £1,400 per month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate of Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at that time, suggesting that the whole increase would finance the loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard variable mortgage rate of BRE dropped from 7.94 per cent in December 2007, to 4 per cent in March of this year, the type that is now available.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still requesting £1.250 per month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as President of the House's opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that Members had to survive "rations" after the cost scandal.
"This is basically nationalized, you have to live in rations and be treated like m**rda."
He said, "I spend my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole with the shape of the sterling pound symbol in Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, approved by both the salary office and then by Legg."
He added: "It is not about circumventing and delinquenting or violating the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be in any way clearer or simpler."
Come to those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advento de la palapa de la beach of Brighton
Brighton's palates have found a new boost for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palates for every December day, using villains as their theme.
The event began on 1 December, with guests who could see the last lap from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with full pastels and free punches served.
The villains chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He stated: "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we expect as a Church that people come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the Palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in protest of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched through the frozen Danish capital on claim of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with adoquines and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to the police, they are particularly members of the "Black Blocks", ultra violent groups that had already acted at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinctions", underlining that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The quite peaceful demonstration came out of Parliament and went to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
A scene was set to accommodate the guest speakers. The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle-warming vigil.
Most protesters arrived by bus and train from large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial rainstorms responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the invitation of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to claim compensation for ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: there's time, said Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers are drying up, watercourses that can be walked as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "join climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming does not oppose the struggle for another world".
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kickoff to demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded red dresses and garnished cloths with slogans for solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of demonstrators were formed, demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Tens of people were concentrated in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, Georgia's pro-Separatist region recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Election tables closed at 5:00 GMT.
According to the leaders of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first interim results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, who disapproved of voting.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "sorry that Abjasia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," stated his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared to AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted in Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large paintings show Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
At a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow for its support, and particularly for the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, answered by raising his vodka vessel.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday tens of thousands of people went to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an impressive demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the midst of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes the delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement that will enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, which was quite peaceful, left Parliament and went to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A scene was set to accommodate the guest speakers. The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle-warming vigil.
A few moments after the beginning of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 persons, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted at the NATO summit in Strasbourg in eastern France last April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with an adoquin, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to the police.
The extremist groups did not take their eyes off them, prevented the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces overflew the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the great cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial rainstorms responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the invitation of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and climate".

The Oxfam organization, together with the former UN refugee commissioner, Mary Robinson, who had to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kickoff to demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, manifested red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans for solar energy in front of the City Hall of Philippine Capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators claimed to act against climate change were formed.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be transmitted in the Sunday Informative (JDD) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific bachelorship.
From now on, all the first undergraduate students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "sufficient with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, summons the best students".
The branches of General and Literary Teaching cannot be sub-samples of the C, it goes on to emphasize: "I didn't even hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged by having eliminated history and geography in the second degree of bachelor's degree in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French 10 (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in second degree C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the second bachelor's program C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, they say, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also practice in real terms during the year of M2, and then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the practices proposed prior to the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, you added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he is going to propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to eliminate the school map "before 2012".
At the High Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that he accepted on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street High Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize, opened the conference round "Ernest", a day composed of a series of 15-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, reported a AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something to attract people and convey them the desire to know more, explained in the framework of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezzo conference, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts of his discipline and selected them on his charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about 50 people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed that the public would understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific record".
The videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's website from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: disgust among prison guards, plans to take action
The prison guards' unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers Force (2nd guard union) asked the staff to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their possessions.
The prison CGT (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "gather in general assemblies in different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization", since it calls for "disgraceful and unacceptable" the failure to pay in December of the "extra hours, nocturnal premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Autonomous Prisons Federal Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Foreign Office reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the Watch Unions guaranteeing that payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts of staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I urge the Directorate of Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not occur again in the future.
The December payment will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums by functions and objectives, and who "always blames the budget demands," Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, he said outraged the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing his decision to boycott up to new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if the ones in October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threat FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time that we are increasing our tasks and missions without taking any more effective action, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff salary, it estimates the prison CGT of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, not in all regions, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected result, stated Ufap's Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those he receives
American President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous television host Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that the ABC chain will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the year-end parties in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be on the way.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to the extracts of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's statements about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way, last year I gave you nice gifts," she said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before he answered humorously pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who gave devotion to Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite children's gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
Just years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, rather than accommodate them around the house, however, I loved that doll house, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again involved in Los Angeles due to important "damages" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his associates, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday night on Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors verified "discal hernia" injuries carried out in Paris on 26 November, he pointed out his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquility saying that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about his/her status, adds RTL.
The press service, interrogated by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park's international clinic due to a discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days ago, was performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection resulting from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on Thursday at RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured him that there was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him it was a nonsense to do twelve hours of plane after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure him by saying that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted successfully with antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled."
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the health problems of the singer multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on by a "colon cancer", after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as was expected, his long "Turn 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overstated. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the musician to move on.
In mid-November, their allies even had to deny a new admission.
Euro-2009/short swimming pool: first Bousquet title in your favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist in the Long Pool World Cup-2009, received an international title on Thursday at a distance where he feels particularly affectionate, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in a short swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition where polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand that owns in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queens of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed with 20''53 during a final event where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet advanced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane bathers that from 1 January will be banned.
These bathers, origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of the bathers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double champion of the world in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he was imposed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this career.
I knew this time I was not going to be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a hard rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: A sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola sold in USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday in $1.5 million, far above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art marcher.
This panel of 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysiac scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satires and drunken women, is an uncommon piece, since there are only four or five in the world," explained Tuesday to the AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of the ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most uplifted by buyers, no doubt, pointed to the AFP a spokesperson for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bathtub in his particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time before Marshal Petan took power.
For some fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras Aborted the Exit from Zelaya to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico felt that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory to the overthrown President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied his safe conduct.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility to carry out the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The plane of the Mexican government that arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to take her to Zelaya returned to her place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
To grant him a safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renunciate" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to reach Mexico as the guest chief of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to give up my office (...), they wanted me to present my resignation," Zelaya said on Thursday on Globo radio, in which he often makes statements from the beginning of the political crisis that has been in Central America for five months.
Here I can stay for ten years, I have my guitar, added by playing some chords the retired president, refugee in the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted us a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain asylum orders, declared Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, on HRN Honduran Radio.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview at the Telesur chain, which is based in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he underlined.
The rumors about the departure of Zelaya mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the President-in-Office, who met around the Brazilian embassy, strongly besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government in relation to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day on which he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If you go, you will be arrested and will have to answer to the justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial ballot, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by countries of Latin America, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until it finished its term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Thursday, the figures on the US trade balance are faithful witnesses to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to final figures on closure, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq, with a technological component, 7.13 points to 2,190.6 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the medium full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
The analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the main economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States were increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "has been the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield amounted to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond yield to 4.492% against 4.408% on Friday.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of power ambush the "Dames de Blanco"
This Thursday, hundreds of supporters of the Cuban power ambushed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies de Blanco", wives or family members of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked towards the centre of the capital claiming the release of these detainees, a journalist from the AFP stood.
The Yankees die!, "Mercenarias!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!"coreaed with the fist on top of the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian-dressed agents who came to "protect them."
On the eve of the day, a similar demonstration broke out against the "La Habana Ladies" in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to speak out on Thursday for the international day of human rights, were arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothing, a journalist from the AFP reported.
The agents forced the vehicles to the dissidents who were ambushed by government supporters, according to that journalist.
Generally, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances takes only a few hours.
The "Ladies of White", awarded with the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call on opponents of "mercenaries" or "actors" at the expense of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely done in the media, Cuban television reported on the manifestation of the government's militants on Thursday against the "counterrevolutionarys".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
A dead man killed an octogenarian with a knife and left 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday at the hour of greatest influx of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have hit with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an elder, in the pharmacy or in front of it in No. 85 of the Boulevard Jean-Jaureès, reported police sources and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a manager of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about 30 years old, stepped in and was injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were transferred to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other injured, with the apparently affected vital organs, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," a police source reported.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently by chance, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: one man thirty years old, and another one forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still undisturbed.
He was armed with two butcher's knives that he was wearing crossbacks, explained in the place a union leader Alliance in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the disposal, according to the testimony obtained by the PSA.
I saw a guy about thirty years old wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, explained.
A crowd threw himself on him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, added.
By the Boulevard Jean-Jaureès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to stop the armed man and were wounded by fists, according to the testimony of the police.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are numerous shops.
Some people came to tell me there was a man wounded on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person aged about 35 years arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office investigated the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the High Court Police of the Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his interim detention he has not said a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of entering a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were required to dominate him at the police station in Clichy where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again requests that the case be dismissed
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the cause is dismissed against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of "El Pianista", denounced three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California grave procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I demand that the charges be dismissed at this very moment, since the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "has turned out to be chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who had died since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before giving a sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was published in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), of the prosecutor's own mouth in question, David Wells.
But at the end of September Wells declared "false" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in the event that the court rejects the rejection of the case.
The accusation, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, i.e. that no serious dismissal of the charges could be assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
Since then, he has never stepped on the United States again.
Los Angeles District Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "has to be here to attend the hearing."
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility to flee? Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "asks a favor to the court, though he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, now 90 days old to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He claims that his client no longer supports him harassing her every time the Polanski case resuscitates, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by order of American arrest.
After more than two months after the fences, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, waiting for possible extradition.
Wall Street loses its course and slows down by the raise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday unbiased, in a market that is discussed between better indicators than those expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63 per cent, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03 per cent.
According to the final figures at the closure, Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blicksilver said of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is getting smaller and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained through the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve market opinion on the robustness of economic reactivation", summarized by Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November per second consecutive month and higher than expected.
Furthermore, U.S. consumer confidence was visibly recovered in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed down by a further rise in the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, of the Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury bonus performance amounted to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and the 30-year-old bonus to 4.497% against 4.492% on the eve.
The election of Miss Mundo again in South Africa
After one month of tour to South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss Mundo’s title are in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world against a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them had already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Beltran Pearl of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Deportista or even Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real riot.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and lived countless experiences!," said amazed Miss Sierra Leone.
This event, which takes place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast on Saturday live from Midrand, to Northern Johannesburg, beginning at 5 p.m. (15 GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova points out in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian girl, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and by the possibility of discovering again "African landscapes that take away the breath".
After a month of galas, essays, press wheels and safaris, candidates to Miss Mundo concentrate on the contest.
India Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both turned into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade with traditional dresses and, of course, with bath.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, the former queen of South African beauty, Michelle McLean, and a committee leader Miss Mundo, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa demonstrated its ability to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World event.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Something unusual for a head of state, she observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dealing with people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably coming back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallday "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going out very well, told the press David Hallyday on his way down from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13 o'clock local (21 h GMT).
The son of the singer, distanced, assured him that he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday for an infection derived from the discal hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in an induced coma from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors from the Cedars-Sinaï hospital of Los Angeles, where he entered Monday for an infection, followed by a disc hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on Wednesday night on Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, who attended his daughter Jade, to witness a school act, confirmed a photographer of the AFP.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Hospital de la Pitié-Salpétrière, Yves Catoneré, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer last November 26 at the Monceau Park's international private clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were indignant, Camus said.
You're talking about a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled to Los Angeles too fast with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem with making the trip, because I was operated twice as a discal hernia, he added.
Shortly before at the RTL station, he indicated that apparently the singer had "out of the cannula, without anything," after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, actress Charlotte Gainsbourg also intervened to reabsorb a hematoma formed following a brain hemorrhage.
It is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the justice system on several occasions by malpractice, as well as by tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Medical Order, accused him of being "a man without scruples" demanded "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the post-operative studies were "normal".
The operation "couldn't provoke bleeding and therefore didn't need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I find it very risky, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its logo
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former Giscardist party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, only to be charged.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, he received help from Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to register it at the National Industrial Property Institute in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF association office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the stamp and transfer the rights of ownership of the mark to them, on the basis of a judicial claim.
Over the past few days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose your political movement to recover the UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the +New center+, and the slogan + the UDF of today'hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, support the letter signatures.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium, as well as of (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to legitimate owners."
If not, justice will be invoked to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories will be warned.
In the letter, they need that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "chosen" went in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress in 2007 voted on its accession to MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continue the office, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It uses scandalously and fraudulently the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to perform it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before they mock the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to be made their own name than trying to get out of the anonymity taking fraudulently a name to which it is not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the court of Nanterre decided to bring to trial the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as stated by the daughter of the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenary to expolate her from a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his pictures of stars in the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fines.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reindeer of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to submit to such examinations, even under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors designated this Friday should submit a report by 10 March 2010 stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and for what periods.
I think you'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said on leaving the audience.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother's weakness for a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers to be a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations were, on some occasions, a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters his client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said he was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office once again considered that the complainant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge had refused, in the last few days, to act on his request to open a judicial custody procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no tutor.
No other person will be able to appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be handed down.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter for the employees to adhere to "values" determined from above as before it was about imposing on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the strategies of conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the preference factors of customers is repeated regularly.
Demobilization of employees can end up in deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; it requires employees to make a commitment that fully opposes the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would consist of putting the employees at the centre of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion surveys, such as Orange's questionnaire among its employees, encourage management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many rounds, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the diseases of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from large engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old conductive theory that the U.S. "nerusciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms to the managers in a mechanical management position, inadequate to today's world.
Identifying and measuring mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the good functioning of modern companies, involves adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into all business management reasoning or practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to become a reality of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motifal Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a default dose that enables them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resource management "in place".
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo Address: by "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against U.S. enemies, hailed Obama's speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, Mrs. Palin said, the main figure in the right wing of the Republican Party to the US Today newspaper, and added that she herself had addressed the war theme "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is of course the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, devoted, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For moments, the speech seemed very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider as a possible candidate for Republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a president from the left" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that "they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current chronicler in Washington Post, Obama pronounced "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as "the citizen of the world", as "always does", "he spoke as an American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they didn't create and who don't do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few not very convinced right-wing, a Bush era hawk, the former UN ambassador, John Bolton, called the speech of "monoton, pretentious and lack of inspiration" on the website National Review Online.
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left-central press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his "superproduction" speech especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said excitedly.
Obama "pronounced the discourse that was needed," said the New York Times, judging it "at the same time as dark and uplifting."
Road Transport: Three Marathon Negotiations to Guarantee Christmas Supply
After three sessions of maratonic negotiations, road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon at an agreement that put an end to the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "joyed" by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators fired at the dawn of Friday, hoping to quickly sign the text according to the final hour of the morning.
Even when three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by giving a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours beginning at 11 a.m. was necessary for all to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "was very harmful to companies" and "it was feared to disturb the end of the year parties," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for lower wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8,72 euros to 9,06 for low wages.
Not much, but we started with much disadvantage, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
If so, we are going to order our militants that there are no more cuts or lockdowns in the supply centres.
But there can always be some discontinuous rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good agreement", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of EUR 170 per month for low wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense that respects employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is an "acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of extraordinary pay and the modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employers' charges" was the subject of an amendment by the government in the 2009 Draft Correctional Finance Act, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to companies that are affiliated with this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour extends.
It will be done "with as soon as possible," Bussereau assured.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR claimed that it was an "ingenuity trade", as the EUR 100 million had already been pledged to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax."
The Secretary of State of Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion of an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to contradict those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, Unostra regretted.
For the OTR, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector for the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, unions that disagree with RATP proposals
Conflicts in RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between trade unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their demand for premium.
For this important Christmas weekend, Saturday and Sunday will only travel trains between 10 and 20 hours, due to a train of two on the central stage (between La Défense and Nation) and a train of four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which await 200,000 customers every day, rejoiced that "RATP is striving to provide service to the large stores."
The RER A crosses from west to east the Parisian city.
The RATP stretch runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains circled in peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as expected.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the Andeans thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to get to time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not get tired, the SNCF indicated that it had provided for police and law enforcement supervision.
The RERs operating the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or destined to it arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analyzed, "little satisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that was held with the management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers want to claim a premium due them, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its premium proposals in parenthesis, commented indignantly on the CGT, noting that the management "was unable to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of practice of the profession," said RATP.
What also led the unions to say that the company "doesn't care about weekend users".
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, who had so far refused to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents had made a warning.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has a million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the prokurdo party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main procuring party, a decision which immediately triggered angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government’s task, which has just helped the Kurdish community by trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that undermined the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliz, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç pointed out, and added that 37 of the party leaders, including its President Ahmet Türk and the deputy Aysel Tugluk, were separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity of which Türk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of the party's property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before they were parliamentarians without a partisan label.
The decision arises following a procedure launched by the Supreme Court Prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political display of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s verdict is taking action when the government is holding a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures that strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thereby end the conflict.
The DTP leaders stated that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the Southeast Anatoly, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police during the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have met in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great care of the Southeast mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order Forces dropped tear grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators launched Molotov bombs or stones with hounds.
In Istanbul, approximately one hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was going to "deepen discouragement".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolution of a party, declared to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
Thus nothing is resolved, said the Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can of course expect a PKK reaction, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in recent months.
Snows can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Braenburger wants.
At all, it's something you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the EDF
But with this their employees can learn to test and dominate all of the vehicle technology.
Maybe the weekend meteorologists will announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to handle snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections with large salt vehicles, explains Braenburger.
For example, the main arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also access to the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The EDF service begins around three o'clock in the morning
Approximately 1,040 kilometres should be covered, as necessary, within a maximum of three hours of wet salt, which is better attached.
That's why the FES starts around three in the morning, "with this the tracks are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins."
The hard thing is when it starts to snow around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for salted vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, which also belong to the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the lateral and secondary streets.
That's where the nuisances are generated, you know, Braenburger.
Around five o'clock in the morning is launched at the FES infantry, mainly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
In general, the EDF could not take over all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 a.m. does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Braenburger.
As these become quick swings, the salted vehicle is set in motion as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The dent of the dinosaur
The Tawa found the same look as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal of two meters long and 1.50 meters high that ran on the two strong hind legs, had an extended head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with blade-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa found it was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of Texas University in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found in one day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is unprecedented for sediments of the Triasic, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they brought together all the remains of five specimens.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "Triasic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, for example Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to current view, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
The experts thus discuss, for example, when the sauries were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous teropods among which the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivores (herbivores with bird pelvis), to which they belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa foundae is a primitive teropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa find the researchers found signs of airbags, such as those that also own the descendants of the teropods, the birds.
Thanks to air bags, bird breathing is more efficient than mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the teropod with older and primitive airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the later giant sarropods also possessed light-bodies and airbags, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers deduced that the saurias appeared there for the first time.
Therefore, the three genealogical lines separated at first and spread from South America across all corners of the Earth, which by then still formed a unique earth mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa finds the remains of two other not very closely related thermopods.
The three cannot descend from a single parented predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migration waves were taken to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of dinosaurs, lived in the present-day Poland, says the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
Your opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils continue to be preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare sideline of reptiles to mesozoic dominant terrestrial vertebrates remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in Triasic dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosauri and many other saurias.
Toward the end of the Triasic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship extinguished at the limit of the Triasic towards the Jurassic.
Successful Stories Were Not Eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It may have been given a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the competitors in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact brakes the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triasic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley in California are involved.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt affected the whole world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also from higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are united with the students in protest at the Campus de Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, released last week the building occupied by students and teachers on an educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
Material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served to "delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and diverted the attention of the content.
The Governing Council has refused to initiate the necessary negotiations.
Teachers require the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also united with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, comments the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, nevertheless defended the performance of the university and police rector.
We are grateful to the university rector.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, commented on a broadcast by Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The view of opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of carefully studying students' arguments and demands, they are evicted.
The Left has submitted a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret investigation of arms.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Silicon Valley Russian".
Here are important research and production centers of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives from Selenograd have contacted Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "close collaboration protocol" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt, he signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research centre.
Scientific Exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set up a foothold in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics consortia and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for armament research.
Selenograd (translated literally as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, where research facilities were established.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not set for anything sufficiently high.
For the project's supporters, it is simply and clearly about "the new heart of Europe".
The law alone. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rieles, which end in the middle of the city, were then considered fossils of engineering of the 19th century, which acted as brakes of a modern railway traffic, since it used to take a huge amount of time to hook up the locomotives from behind.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but so must it be done.
And that's why the terminals must have disappeared in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is located about half the route of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Courage of Europe".
The S21 will actually be initiated, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
Rail terminals of course do not have any more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE built to Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have made that clear.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the major individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, equipped with many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the railway transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge typical growth of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But the modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road trucks.
However, the new construction sections are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe it is more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other crossings and narrow crossings on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long rieles across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the plot has been built slowly.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport.
The federal government remains pending in Wiesbaden's autonomic parliament, if it is going to file an appeal before the ruling on the prohibition of nocturnal flights of the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have entrusted experts with the legal investigation of the VGH judgement, over 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had reasoned in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to re-regulated the prohibition of night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as expected by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, if it is to file the appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and pressured government representatives to renounce the appeal before the National Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It is quite difficult, if one lets him keep his word, said the chief of the green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We fulfill our word."
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federative government would be attempting through distortions of law and tricks still getting their night flights.
Comprehensive legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first quick print".
We need a legally binding decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Just as the opposition represented it, it would never have been his group's claims about the prohibition of night air traffic.
The U.S. banks return the aid provided.
The large American banks shaken by the crisis strip off their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned once again the aid that the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund had provided from a total of 45,000 million (approximately EUR 30 billion).
And the Citi group also plans to return state aid, according to a report by the U.S. CNBC.
With this, the institutes intend to get rid of the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had achieved approximately 19 billion net money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had a number of means, among others, for the sale of rubles.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked US taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the efforts of the absorption of the investment bank in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also aims to raise money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations vis-à-vis the state.
CNBC reported from a source of known circles that the US bank could now announce for this Thursday the increase of its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June they had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
In the end everything was faster than it was thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative council of the ZDF (German television channel) pressed the editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present to a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF main study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to further damage the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved on the administrative board either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The outcome of the vote was not yet concrete when the drafting of this edition was closed.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed the administrative board with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's removal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Why the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated, that they would not support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the chief of editors had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr.Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor with the argument, which under the direction of Brender the ZDF news would have lost audience rates.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was flagged.
At the end, 35 public law specialists, who described Koch as unconstitutional, had joined the debate.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romantic philology.
He then worked at the station "Südwestfunk" and in the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the "heute-journal" information.
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Greens political party announced a constitutional demand after the removal of Brender, who was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the Media Journal "Medium Magazin".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the government of Rhine-Palatinate, explained last week that the states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of politicians who supported the control guilds of the ZDF was discarded by Beck.
The probable successor of Brender, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative council with an intelligent play: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under suspicion of giving him the position of a supporter.
In the calculations of the Frey parties is awarded anyway to the left liberals.
University careers clear
Partly success for students: after a year of educational-related strikes, the ministers of education and culture of the states finally yielded. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of undergraduate and master.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each module in the race must end with a single examination.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
Federal states are committed to making structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Rules of the states which diverge from this, must no longer exist.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and university directors are constantly talking about improving the ability to successfully complete and complete a career (studyability).
Now for the first time, we talked about a particular content.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single examination", it says in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" it is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future "studyability" should be the crucial criterion in configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to the unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to more spaces, which enable and promote their own initiative."
These rules would apply to new careers, but also to the examination of existing careers.
These must be "recreed" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is established by the states.
The Ministers of Education and Culture urged the states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
Until now only Rhineland-Plainada has ensured that additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process have been provided.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counselling programs, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The Federal State and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wanted to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, a single review should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, besides ensuring recognition of assessments at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all the careers about its "studyability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the federal state.
Apart from the commendations, there were also criticisms about decisions.
At the federal level board of the Joso University Groups (Youth Socialists) needed, that the setting up of education policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
By the end of the education strikes, students should now be able to take an opinion as well.
The president of the board of university directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the student experience," she said on Thursday in a meeting with the Education Ministers, with whom HRK decided on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor the possibility of accessing a subsequent Master's career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough study places for Master with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a member of GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But as regards increased access to the Master's degree, the Ministers of Education made no comments.
More than a note to the foot about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is made practically out of control," says the first line of a poem by the lyric Werner Söllner in unbalanced language fragments, in which he feared the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, and in 1993 he taught the memorable poetry lectures or lectures in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
God said that last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its security files"
Visiblely insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Security against colleagues German-Roman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the present in 1989, Söllner had received the German language prize.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly in early 1971.
"So I am someone who did not defend himself sufficiently in the face of the attempts to provoke fear of the Security," Söllner concluded.
Werner Söllner lyric is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and his literary controversy without equal with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors coming from Romania for a case that shows the abismos and the wickedness of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only author but also victim.
In his file of Security IM Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him positive from Walter.
He had excused or defended him at all the hard points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-disident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Security-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in the month of July on the weekly " Zeit", after reading his own 914-page file.
Those involved would surely have speculated and would have known in some cases what names were hidden behind Sorin, Voicu and Walter's pseudonyms.
Unlike the review of Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, treatment with security control records is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the safety files (CNSAS), under the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then has been rather traced.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former chief of the Temesvar Security spoke despectively of the decorated.
"She has psychosis," she was questioned only once at the end.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as many times when there is silent guilt.
Why right now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to the confession of Söllner lets hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the longings of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, is more than a simple note to the foot.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When Stuttgart's new VfB football team coach, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team provider, approached a Mercedes taxi from Class C a quarter hour after midnight, gave the impression that an elegantly dressed external service member was leaving from a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man of the bald feature had hired a driver because he had not yet known the city.
On the other hand, he could also drive the car himself: in the end, there was no alcohol at stake, nor was he drunk of joy the 55-year-old man.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we reach the eighths of the finals", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against descent."
The " significantly more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, we will need to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the everyday life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evident again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Success
The final eighths of the Champions League (parties from 16/17 and 23/24 February/parties back 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So joy was kept limited by the fulminating entry of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the so-called savior, who had soon inspired the disconcerted professions of Stuttgart to trust themselves, ready to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to concentrate on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the body repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse emerges in football, sometimes there are things that have not been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a few weeks of a break due to an injury, immediately progressed to becoming the best local player thanks to her dynamism, tried to describe the perceived "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way to work from the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what was missing, obviously, when Babbel was.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the test yet, warns Sports Manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs mostly constancy.
Like Gross, players as well as the administrator refrained from overestimating the triumph against a weakened defense due to lack of relief and totally overrun by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had come the sad awakening, gave Khedira thought.
And executive Horst Heldt warned that although a season goal had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We haven't been through the problem yet.
Heldt had no desire to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters for three months ago, was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by doorkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, confronted Heldt with Lehmann's harsh criticism.
The latter had blamed weakness in the direction of the governing council, which had decided to change from coach to pressure from teen fans.
Also that he would have eliminated his day off after the games called him Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," answered Heldt, and announced consequences for the last.
They'll probably not be friends forever, the two of them.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without prior efforts with the replacement coach team, it would not have been possible to perform a great game and battle force.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important share in success," said Heldt and Lehmann unison; and also agreed with the man of the plastic suitcase.
World heavyweight championship fight
Ardiente duel in Bern: again and again the retractor Kevin Johnson was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judge's trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version won on Friday night a Saturday in Bern to the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian was already twice world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the night they had all hoped for could not be realized.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice had to be defeated due to his injuries.
Coach Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his number 24 fight.
About 17000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging over and over the world champion's blows, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right to his goal.
Generally speaking, the Johnson liability did too little for a retractor, and only tried to pass the rounds.
Although Klitschko was being provoked by words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the retractor had already produced a scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," who "he doesn't know how to do anything."
In weighing, the champion let himself shake on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a nearly four-year break, he won at that time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year later won in his defenses of the title to Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba, and in September to Chris Areola of the United States.
In this fight I only got one blow, and I'm in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream continues to be gathering all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after it landed in November to Nikolai Valujev, of 2.13 meters tall.
The previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
The company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, a liar because of false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and left-wingers require an explanation to the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about Kunduz's air strike, the opposition has blamed the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for being dubious.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast by the ARD television channel, the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been taken without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of NATO's report, which Mr. Gutenberg has read, said Trittin.
Friday it had been revealed that in this attack it was not only about destroying kidnapped trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air raid requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, died or were injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder was part of the Afghan policy of the federal government, and whether the Chancellor, the army and information service had approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his Green colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected criticism.
The chancellorship did not exert any influence on the specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday they had also expressed doubts about the Ministry's presentation on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on convoys.
It had been officially said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials, they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a field patrol report.
In the meantime, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has not received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not manifest itself on Saturday with regard to the complaints made to it, and he pointed out that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Unique worlds
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts do the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can freely deliver ourselves to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience dreamlike states during the wakefulness, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are considered most of the time in the modern Western world as mad or drug addict, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in mentally ill people or drug addicts.
The fault lies with our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes make the limits between sleep, madness and reality be undrawn.
The onlyly modified alert states of consciousness can appear in the most diverse ways, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychodelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Alucinations or deliriums arise when the balance of the neural communication substances in the brain has been derailed – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigil, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to the oniric states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the dispropositions, assigned formations, and mirrors of it".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
His body is two dimensions and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red flies like blood, deformed, brushing their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, burning boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain in the whole body.
Stirring and malignant voices resonate from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls out two stereo cables, binds them to form a hanging knot, and sets them on a hook on the roof.
It goes up in a bowl and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump.
The rope's loose.
What a lesson for you!, they yell out the voices in a chorus that cheers him up, "Go to the clinic and make yourself cured!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, it is also manic-depressive, it takes medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, she says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the times affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disturbances in the relationship, or persecution.
Especially extended is the voice: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the decks to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic of Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of events, everything has a meaning to it.
At the same time, he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as such."
Paranotic thoughts and hallucinations rely on reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an inconcognite why our brain makes cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality on a provisional basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that besides genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain is affected in an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it's still an incognite how that alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which is not revealed at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a previous provision.
Likewise, alucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain's transmission system.
When Your Brain Warms
The illogical point of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment with some, says Professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck psychology.
The perception of hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also surprisingly, of many other diseases.
These include, along with psychic disorders such as personality boundary disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranioencephalic trauma.
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are poorly co-advised; when our brain is warmed, but also when there are no stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, bad love or other emergency brain states.
In the jüngeren Study gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Hallucination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and attended a high school.
An ordinary girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a clumsy boy with long and dark hair gives him the word.
When she answers her, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She wakes up and sees and hears that guy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if you're crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, he does not know whether he is awake or dreaming, if the images he sees, the muzzles or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
His parents and friends haven't told him anything, they would think he's crazy.
In the fall of 2009. Sarah K. She's 20 years old today.
He approved selectivity last year and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations have disappeared.
Since you've been in contact on the Internet with psychologist Kasten, you know he's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art due to despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a time he will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and it's the same as looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at 13 years of age, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he has used reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noisy impressions, those affected like Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Limitation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on the conscious, imaginative experiences usually get pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and doctor head of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Oniric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later cannot differentiate from being awake.
Oniric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyrradiculoneuropania, who experience motor paralysis being fully aware. die bei volem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a complete and permanent motor incapacity, it replaces a real situation very dangerous by a world of its own and imaginary which is decoupled from reality.
A form of limit situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation remains in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unimaginable situation itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his unique experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old when his conscience embarked on days-long travel after a heart valve operation with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by it and visited strange places of other times: he was seen lying on the bed, a bigger man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot was watching for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these interior trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Lighter and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug consumption show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every change of state of consciousness, concludes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
Children will take over the editorial at age 27
The new editor Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, SPIEGEL commented.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at age 27 and have the strong will to enter the company, Burda, 69 years old, confirmed SPIEGEEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put in front of 7,500 workers their children, if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the presidency of the board of directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This 52 member of the Kallen family has been a member of Burda since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took charge of the treasury and thus came responsibility for the company’s assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took charge of direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the stamp of the editorial.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. Their son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save 10.15-year-old differences," says Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda stated that family businesses are not safe from decadence either: "This has always affected families who allow themselves to be infected by the pursuit of capital, who have misjudged and thought that they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had "magnificent delusions," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor in this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league; these businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything - in matters of beauty and well-being - you can wish, within the reach of your hand.
This is what appears to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in Callao shopping center (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, located on the octave plant, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which handles laser hair-piling; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which owns a gymnasium, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while looking at the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to ride your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a Jacuzzi session, massages and taking a champagne cup are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
A total of 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most novel facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulitis or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts by introducing your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles in your body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through hairdressing, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Varied Headphones
Christmas is approaching and it is never more to review the star looks to adapt them to our party costume.
The shape of the escort, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must consider.
There are a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated escort. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa electric company, together with the City Council of Barcelona, has created the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, by managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to push forward what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electric Cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVEL Plan, to promote the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Cataluña.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has assets a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a quiet horizon' for the motor sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, is looking at "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector in the country.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has launched during the financial year to support the car sector.
"Without the Automotion Competitiveness Plan, today we would have an overview of abandonment, closure of some of our main productive plants," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the willingness of brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a quiet horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Automotion Plan (IPA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to developing new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in the light of Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Hall will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and fans of the motor mountain.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pavilion de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only classic motorcycles and cars can be found, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will be articles of all kinds related to the engine world.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the flag, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restaurant; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and restoration; or Cochera Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Exercising skills abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding concentrations, sporting exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and contests.
Skill tests will also be performed with classic cars and motorcycles in a circuit enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sports
Mazda wants to show that sports are not respected with respect for the environment.
Therefore, it has just incorporated into Mazda3 the engine stopping and start-up system - called i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the engine 2.0 gasoline with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved in its entirety.
Finishes, vehicle termination, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we find that the front boots have excellent ergonomics and subjection.
Likewise, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Following the set formed by the table of instruments and the console we see as Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continued with the habitat, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this adds a large and regular trunk.
The engine stopping and automatic start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre petrol engine and 150 horses and with the manual change of six marches.
This engine is a real delight. It excels by its fineness, by its reduced noise, by its benefits and by achieving content consumption.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometres a year should not rule out this i-Stop with a petrol engine, both for its high running comfort, and for its content consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is called Sportive, which incorporates a larger number of serial elements.
From the standard equipment especially the rail exchange assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, in case there was little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive beam headlamps and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It is particularly noteworthy for the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not perform many kilometres a year may opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the petrol engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven -Sportive- version.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us large doses of satisfaction every day.
Luxury premium
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars faded more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexy' on the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five-minute fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing him on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
Given the success of the company has taken out two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as its U.S. counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with smartphones already know what it is like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission's repeated earballs to achieve affordable roaming rates throughout Europe have hardly had a perceptible effect.
Outside of the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (it's always curious to bear the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of tariffs means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other internet queries.
No contracts and no gaits.
It's a connected device and it's paid for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that's what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, an option to buy with access to life as Peek already has in the United States.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If you have already come to Barack Obama's possession as President of the United States with a dress and coat of this color, you have chosen the same to accompany you in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of your life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish yellow with bright reflections - the two times the outfit was made up of three pieces - dressed, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so that at first glance it seemed that the first lady in the United States was following the star of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat dressing.
But the fabric on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the taking of possession it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a butterfly with a print.
The additions have also varied: green medium heel shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked up on this occasion, mesena looses the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems for their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and employment path of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey conducted between 9,737 women between 15 and 75 years of age leaves no doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have experienced limited employment opportunities due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences at the beginning of matrimonial cohabitation and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, start dating first, advance maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after beginning their cohabitation, an increase of 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time of their vital trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of their children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity even less on the timing of mating," explains the researcher at CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that differentiates the age of women at marriage and at first age.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which they marry and their first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who have elementary and higher studies have been mothers for the first time at 25.1-32.1 on average, respectively.
"There is also another division between women based on their level of education.
While those with elementary education get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, the middle or upper level ones invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envyed list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
As of next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, playing the universal motto of 'Because I value it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses in the international panorama, joins other famous prints of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones to enter such a select club were actress Evangeline Lilly ('Perdidos') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in "Losts").
UK Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His highest representatives - designers and models, of yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of his awards, which was held in London, in the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the date.
The former Jerry Hall model and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent’s Poker
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Poquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty X-rays by writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also by the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearsome genres (biographical appearance, life and work), but seeking something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The journey has its excitement and Vicent does not save scares or lighting.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and reading.
Here I leave you some snapshots.
About Albert Camus: "On his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same that I felt without name: pleasure against the near fate, guiltless morals and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihillist, allegorical Christian, wrote what was in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he conjugated the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of the 8,000 meters of universal literature, which must be climbed through the north wall, from which the best mountaineers are laid off again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
On his own, he once said that he was heir to a landowner in the county and others who was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were great."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the mad cry released from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the end of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and did it on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day he knelt and prayed, 'God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ rest after the war,/ after life the very high pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband accepted as normal that she told him that Eduardo VII was spying on her in the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never has the case of such a patient man in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was in front of his madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but pass through the Faulkner weapons in Baroja?
What did Cell but abduct that man's fame to serve him as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly assault
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed along with her and our dog, a specimen of a mestizo race, rescued from the bitch and with no more than six kilograms of weight and, without a word, gave her two kicks that left the injured dog.
Our outrage is capital because we did not find fun in a free aggression to a small, helpless animal, which by the way, was bound.
To this one must be added the suffocation that caused a woman who walked quietly and who, when she cremated these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal, is able to do the same thing with a woman, a child, an elderly person or, ultimately, anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event occurred at five o'clock in the afternoon of any Tuesday by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubted it would be useful for much and not to generate susceptibility, only to clarify that the cowards were Spanish.
Infuriation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so they consider it fun to treat a helpless animal for free that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among younger drivers, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in case of an accident while riding on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond designing and manufacturing products every day safer" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other actions of a pedagogical and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, as being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly secure products.
Move up the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent a 12.6% increase compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to the figures of the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and the sellers Ganvam.
The good data, however, should be put into quarantine, since the reference to which the comparison is made -November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the last month's rebound, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the tailoring box of light commercials: derived from tourism, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks/chairs.
Also, no nubarrons have disappeared that most affect their demand, because although they are also acquired by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
As a result, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation are to be added to the restrictions imposed by the closure of bank credits.
In view of this picture and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has recently been provided.
In addition to individuals, autonomous and SMEs who are going to purchase a light trade of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been evidenced.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The sales association predicts 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As has happened with the ABS brake anti-locking and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already available in all new-regulating light commercial tourism and vehicles, while for the rest a period of shortage is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, by its way of working, it can also help avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency brake assistant does what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the pedestrian that the driver gives.
But it doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, the third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to step the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Aid intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance the car uses to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided by year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one out of four deaths with damage to people would be avoided - when the so-called emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects the obstacles and alerts the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the greatest effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delays the plan for Opel until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - on 8 probably - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will take more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points in the plan was previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document to be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, from GM it is ensured that a decision on Saab’s sale should be taken in the coming days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM supports contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but takes the choice of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is supported by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
On the steering wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and jewelry face, Porsche's engineers took Boxster S as a base and made it thinner at nothing less than 80 kilograms, which left the scale at only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to exclude, first of all, the automatic roof that has been supplied by a hand-operated canvas, saving 21 kilos; using aluminium doors like GT3 doors; 'caen' others 15; removing the air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, gained 7 kilos more; mounting other 12 sports bacquets and with 19 inches light wheels, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system provided another six kilograms and changing the door handles by some canvas, the remaining kilogram.
Although it is also offered with the double clutch PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the 6-speed manual box, mainly by secondary roads in California, in mountain sections with truly reversed traces
Their behavior can only be classified as untraceable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not tread the asphalt with aploma.
Rather, the opposite: for some time we had not tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, it would transmit so much security in the step by curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short march for the time necessary, until we command him to breathe, brake, recover and express his engine again...
What we ask for. Thanks to your address, as communicative as accurate, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Motor sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine roar, already pulled out earlier in the Panamera.
Accelerating capacity is brutal, either from the standstill or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the berries well.
Electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in one of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, already entered in the morning.
Finally, an ultralight car, of the most fun driving you can drive on the market and that is something more than a simple modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate of Karl pergafeld, image of Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlet' of the parades of the 'maison', the singer produces her malotta face with as much bluntness as her Chanel pockets.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia’s victory in Israel
The Labor Fund achieved a brilliant victory for 82-91 on its visit to Maccabi Electro’s complicated field, despite the numerous casualties with which Dusko Ivanovic’s team counted, and in this way is located in the leadership of his group, after Mirza Teletovic’s great performance, which with eight triple scores was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Victorian team was aware of the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work even though it had to suffer to the end to be done with victory.
In addition, the big hit from the perimeter, with 16 triple scores had much to do with the final triumph.
The game started face-to-face for the tiles, which were placed from the beginning forward on the marker.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already made it appear that they had jumped to the Israeli field with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects from 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second room was more than the same, but the team praised the internal game of Barac and the work of Eliahu, who was received with balls and applause on the return to his home, to continue expanding his advantage at rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less six' of Splitter''s rating already predicated that this was not going to be the best night in Brazil.
But the party, despite being incarcerated at rest, was not determined by much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the victors that in their field they didn't win anyone, and with 'Elijah''s hand pressed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the turning of the 'bitter' to the bright (50-49).
More disadvantages
Ivanovic's, wounded but not much less dead, needed to hilarize a pair of moves with correct to catch air, and in those came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to make the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Allaves came out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's ones did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the party had already owned and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the battle of Unicaja
The Unicaja suddenly lost in Greece before the Olympics and gave him the leadership of Group B of the Euroliga, in a party marked by the casualties of the cashiers, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of Peace and Friendship, nor by the rival's entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, disfigured the premises 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the interior game with Bouroussis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned to the score 22-20, minute 13, when an action, coined, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, assumed the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the fall by injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal shortcomings of Carlos Jiménez, were dragging the cashiers.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian alert Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible ride back
The third period was very offensive to the Olympiacus, which despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even came to equal the difference of the meeting disputed in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group leadership slam.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last fall of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences the One by the leadership and the triples of Cook, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics when they pressed and gave their superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to remount basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went off, delivering leadership to the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the highest number of classified listings of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The How much should you charge? tool calculates the wages of users from over 140,000 job offers available from Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they should introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application runs, the searcher has noticed that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit of his searchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 receiving a Spanish one.
Similarly, a driver charges €34,247 per year in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 net euros annually; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs in the network in the last three months are drivers, middle-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets date to the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President's deposit shall leave the diplomatic legacy by 27 January 2010 at the latest when it officially concludes its term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term of office, he has to seek another destination."
The station also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya the political asylum status that he intended to impose on him the "de facto" government that President Roberto Micheletti had.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant point in the markets, the uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not be strange since it is its natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilize the markets was monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving liquidity free bar to types close to zero for financial institutions to buy discount assets.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have almost completed and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differentials of the corporate bonds have repointed again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an increase in the differences in the eurozone countries over Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that it arrived Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision to the lower rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to silence moral risk defenders who were again trying to raise awareness of those responsible for global economic policy because they have curbed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on job destruction, when what they would have to do is decide a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai's portrayal of a tribal struggle between the emires to recompose power in the Emirates and that of Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls out the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from failure to comply with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro to fulfil its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expected.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differentials extend as much as the European corporate bonds should not be concerned.
If European differentials decline and ours continue to expand, then it would be Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario up to 2011 including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not long for life expectancy for their warning.
Again, it has all the look that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "prudence, driver friend".
Related sectors
President Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain's energy strategy is discussed these days in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushes of what he had raised in the closed subcommission.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros up to 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not amount to 60 billion, but to up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing generation capacity, but at distribution networks and international interconnections
From 2020 on, the issue has changed and power will already have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that there is a need for 18,000 new MW, that is, with other "support energies".
Galán, who considers that the draft Sustainable Economy Act just approved by the Government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "point" measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, should begin to take a long-term course of action as they are long-term in maturity and there is a need for a stable remuneration framework to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus 'handling' at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, Switzerland Swissport, will play the leading partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, which has not transcended economic terms, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the Alcalá University of Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The alliance includes an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50 per cent corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Share your first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Actoa fights for its first concession highway in Australia, where it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and Sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a builder and dealer of highways.
City Council wants to have it ready at the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to move forward the project, in a business plan guarded by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do the work and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to $1.7 billion (EUR 1.047 million) and in the last phase they compete with three consortia with remarkable presence of European builders.
The group named Transcity is led by Actoa, the only Spanish in the luza, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed is the so-called LBRJV, where Australia's Leighton (filial of the German builder Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala signature specializing in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it has a clear difficulty in entering unless it is through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the cited Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be the pending subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its participation of 30% in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
MILLIONARY ASSETS
It is committed by a geographical area of utmost importance to the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy provider and in the sale business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind park, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies to raise and manage Adelaide desalator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The underground road, promoted by the Infrastructure Office of the city of Brisbane and called Northern Link (northern link), is called to join the western highway of Toowong with the bypass track in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the biggest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The schedule marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this payment step would open up to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 388 million) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who reported yesterday that a contract with the Government was awarded at 154 million.
The participation of ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national wideband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give German work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still about to begin and Hochtief closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a Slovenian highway amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The firm gets this contract days after the work of expanding the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) by 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awarded Renfe advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to Mrs Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros annually, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been elected from among the 16 agencies that have presented themselves to the competition convened by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Many 63 million to France Télécom for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephones with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this penalty, the old French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for blocking its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and therefore is a recurrence.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed the star of other operators and has opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing incomes that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Play the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that most money have won in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue from major clubs.
Thus, the competition has distributed €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was set up in 1992/1993, according to UEFA data.
The Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have been well-stopped from this division.
The white club has been the third on the continent that most money has been paid for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992 is the fifth of the rankings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern of Munich, the two teams who also billed more money for participating in the past Champions League.
And that, despite losing both of them in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chairing Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million by the Champions League.
From this money UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the pre-grading round (including the Madrid Athletic) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, plus another 550,000 euros for each party they dispute.
There is also bonus to win (800,000 euros) and draw (400,000 for each team).The eighthfinalists will receive three million each; the eight fourthfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be reimbursed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, with regard to fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million to win the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main places, and has four seats assigned.
The champion of the previous year is left with 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group broke down yesterday the details of the offer of purchase of shares with which it seeks to acquire a top of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public tender for acquisition (opa) for all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share which would be disbursed in 10 years and which would be paid with an interest for this 1 per cent annual deferral
Yesterday Sos shares closed to 1.85 euros; therefore, New Rumasa's offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerezian group provides a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV assured not to have been informed of the offer, despite the fact that Ruiz Mateos stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If this happens, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalisation of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his address.
In an attempt to remain on the edge of possible offers of purchase and the judicial vavenes of his former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes it the first woman to hold a high office in the food company.
This is a new establishment post which will depend directly on the group chairman.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company continues to engage in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos reveals new diversions of funds
With regard to the Salazars' credit, the former Councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) stated yesterday in the National Audience that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorizes the Paternina exclusion op that presented Investora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion op presented by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by believing that its terms conform to the existing rules and consider the contents of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments made on 2 December.
CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternine at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95 % of its social capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current legislation.
New Car Expertise Tools
In these days of weather and accidents, they don't just win car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are towed up to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No sinister is the same, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complicated task.
Calculate the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces of work, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, it would be a matter of little importance.
That's why almost 100% of experts use these types of systems.
Service providers and solutions for the valuation of claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, and then to developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American Solera group, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with their products.
The other firms competing in the field of taxation and information processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, Spain, work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in different formats.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed does not cease to increase, to the extent that more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched in the last five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car goes into the market, these companies start to work.
It is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter their price.
In addition, each model performs a "smart" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "painted".
If it's a pattern of mass sales, the job can be ready within a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the circulating mobile park, they exceed 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in developing these databases.
Each month includes 2.5 million data, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for the management of scrapping parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that can be provided to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution for valuation of sinisters, for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and heavy or light industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting bar.
This tool is paid by use, by each rating.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertries, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass concentrates on vehicle moons, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to upload by vehicles declared to total sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by homodeleous brands.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone through the workshop due to failures or how many have suffered severe losses in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It commercializes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Tax Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year in the last three years, and in 2008 it billed 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, their internationalization process began, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex, for his part, was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Reportex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19,1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion in Stock Exchange, and now its shares are worth $2.400 million.
Since 2007 it has been listed in the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of injured cars
Last October, the Solera group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The operation was made up of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the capital of the company, which could be extended to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is aimed solely at industry professionals such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, scraps and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was set up in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and some 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been lowered cannot recirculate, but can be used as a replacement for certain parts that are not damaged.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even though they have been lowered after some tedious actions.
Four-step workshop budget
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the replacement, create the budget and generate the budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals that, to a greater or lesser extent, they are more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 totterrenos, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it you need a computer with internet connection.
Once the model has been identified to be repaired by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the workforce, charges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently the Audatex company is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside face.
