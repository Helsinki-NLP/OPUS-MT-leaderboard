Members of the Assembly (AM) in Wales are concerned about "looking muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are bewildered by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Wales Parliament (MWP, in English).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament in Wales.
Members of the Assembly throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this can be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned "that he remained with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A member of the Wales Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but pointed out that MWP's pronouncement to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be the matter of the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Wales Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option received most of the support in a public consultation.
The members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the operation of the assembly, such as rules on the inability of Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of what should be called when deliberating on legislation.
The Macedonians come to the polls to vote for a referendum on the change of name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday about whether your country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a complaint from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy to EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of San Martín remain silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither one thing nor the other."
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"Now people socialize in another way," he says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbors go regularly."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments full of the type of people who will not help the shrines that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and will therefore speed up the closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will end up being members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martín a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation was in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation that served as a nearby cult acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of San Martín, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to street 125 traders, a major shopping street of Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while Father Johnson’s parishioners were making plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the trolley.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martín, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert playing the trolloon called: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from Michigan University, pointed out that she was the first trolley in the world used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who went to play the 18-year-old Riverside Church trolley.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martín didn't replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wound a 13-year-old boy who was diving in search of lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving in search of lobsters in California on the day the lobster season opened, according to the authorities.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed the channel KSWB-TV from San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that at first he thought he was just excited to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that "I was screaming that they had bit him

had the nail broken," Hammel observed when he came to the boy.
"I grilled everyone out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press conference that had seen a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami Beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans boost the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the corridors of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at 2800 trillion pounds and with a growth that is increasing compared to the fall of fashionable sales and household appliances, the largest beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, the same will be done in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this chain of supermarkets looks for ways to use space in shelves that used to be intended for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch your Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something more and more demanded by younger customers.
Also, in the perfumery The Fragrance Shop will prove its concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments, the first newly inaugurated in Croydon, in southern London last week. The second will be inaugurated in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the change to daily purchases of small quantities of food in local stores require supermarkets to make an effort to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will increasingly look like malls while the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount establishments by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has included Argos discount sales points in hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since their purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have driven the sales of edible and profitable more these purchases.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in early 2000, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide revenue from sales points of pharmaceutical products in their supermarkets.
The new strategy arises following the sale of the 281 pharmaceuticals establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, a company that owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £ 125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the appearance and environment of our beauty corridors so that they can potentiate the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offer is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination of beauty products, challenging the old way to buy."
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks an agreement of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, Dragon's Den's star, went "furicious" after television host Holly Willoughby broke an agreement of 11 million pounds with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and Truly add-ons.
This business had compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old presenter announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, Dragon's Den's star, by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furiously" when the television gold girl admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to £1.5 million, did not leave time to dedicate to Truly, her fashion brand and accessories, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was profiled as a favorite to double Willoughby's fortune of about 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced that he was leaving the Instagram business, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one referenced source commented: "Truly was, by contrast, Holly's top priority.
It was to be its long-term future, which would keep it in the next two decades.
His decision to give up left all those involved totally stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters, products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the release of this Morning's presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago they have been closely associated with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
Couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby is going to become a brand-name ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an I'm A Celebrity program presenter on the ITV channel.
A source near Jones said that last night "no business topics were talked about."
A hard conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticisms he received from the media by making a comment that some would consider "little presidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented with his ridiculous voice of "news presenter."
"I've given up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested to meet him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have been stagnant.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see a "adequate response" from the United States at the first steps towards North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, he pointed out that the United States continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in his speech during his rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of the missile trials, help free hostages and bring the deadly remains of U.S. soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing to the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population in Lombok had had to move, a national emergency had not been declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which complicates things a little," says Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are still not sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutope, spokesperson for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Given that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, may have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travelling from one island in Indonesia to another poses a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital boat located in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo converted the improvement of Indonesia's wasted infrastructure into the central axis of his electoral campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko's administration, which is facing a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face pressure from the persistent sectarian tensions of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while bands of Christians and Muslims were fighting in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the marker to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal at minute 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to something more than 27 meters from Chelsea's gate when the marker was 1-0.
He placed the balloon on his left foot with a touch before throwing it into the second pole.
The action sent him over the area and headed towards the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the balloon passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell into the network.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to do with the ball and players like Shaq always play very ahead, so I tried to give myself as much time as I could," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was coming up and gave him a touch. I didn't think too much, just shot."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midpoint made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that move, before turning around making a race near the middle camp and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the balloon and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful pass to the space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished throwing the balloon at the network of the second post with a kick with the left foot that Alisson Becker, from Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool plays against Naples in the group phase of the Champions League. The meeting will be held at St. Paul Stadium in Naples, Italy.
For its part, Chelsea faces Videoton in UEFA Europe League Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency at the first hour of Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the debris of the buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and that unleashed waves of up to six meters, as reported by the agency’s spokesman, Sutope Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead on Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews, on John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the initial stages, but it would encourage anyone who was close to Jonh Street, in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend that anyone, especially taxi drivers, be able to pick up something in Dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our research."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who believe to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victims' relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his apartment, but the police tell him no one can get in or out of the building.
He was puzzled when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that they will be allowed to enter again in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
Don't stop saying "it's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the rope and one more outside.
Several agents stood inside the cord controlling the floor block.
Any person who has information is requested to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously in number 0800 555 111, record 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last commemorative success for "rewrite history"
Its prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this destruction of the Taliban style of many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "crazy" and a "try to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from Westminster Palace would become an objective.
The iconoclasty of British civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice himself to Cromwell for the actions of his ancestors, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebrating.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
If this is a fully accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th century conflict has given shape to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy to celebrate and commemorate."
A Hound Killer Attacks a Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned and blood-covered artery near a small portion of the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder prepares to inject vaccines to pigs from a pocilga in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently, he traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pocilga was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth in the pocilga.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-pound pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and crushed," said the cousin, who is addressed by his surname, "Wu", to The Guiyang Evening News.
The images of the security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager informed The Evening News that the pig was locked up to stop him from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
It seems that the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their deaths.
Although they're rare, it's not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 295 kilos grabbed a farmer on his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After some pigs were eaten by an Oregón farmer in 2012, a Manitoban farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "defeating".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What needs to be done is to have proper respect for them," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave strong widespread rains in the southwest of the United States.
As planned, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains all over northern Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa sparked wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane from Sunday to 5:00 in the morning (Eastern Time) and was located almost 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean they are beginning to generate low pressures, which are moving east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the lower California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rains toward the North, towards the southwest of the United States.
Rose will leave more than 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain strikes with the low pressure that is approaching, there will be strong widespread rainfall in the south-west over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, flows of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause rainfall of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Because of the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden floods may occur with rapidly worsening conditions.
Because of this threat of tropical rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
Strong rains could turn cannons into windy rivers and storms will cause ripple winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rains in specific parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains may leave nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make the roads rock.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaparones will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and the first hour of Monday, before the rain is widespread at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, there may be some intense changes in temperature in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes this implies drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long heat of summer will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the U.S. is expected to start warm October, with widespread temperatures that will run 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the north-east.
On Tuesday, in New York temperatures could be reached of up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high temperatures higher than average for the east of the United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's appearance
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimonies that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly happened in the 1980s, gave him on Thursday on six television channels.
In the meantime, politics continued to die and the media interrupted their usual programming to broadcast the latest news on Friday: an agreement designed by Senator Jeff Blake, Arizona, to have the FBI carry out an investigation into the charges for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Commission that he is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh toked her in a state of intoxication and that he tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company recorded the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some problems to calculate how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football match of playoffs or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fuels the lead channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a show that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC had 2.94 million, the MSNBC had 2.89 million, and the CNN had 2.52 million, commented Nielsen.
After the appearance, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the CNN cameras and the CBS caught how protesters shouted at him when he was trying to climb an elevator to attend a court hearing.
While receiving these complaints, broadcast live by the CNN, he was shot down.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
And he went on, "You have power when there are so many women who don't have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a communiqué and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would count more on his appearance to the Commission.
The cable and radio channels broadcast everything on live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose the candidature of Kavanaugh to the Senate to vote on it.
However, Flake said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the charges made against the candidate during the following week, which they had been asking for some Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the talks she had with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made her decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, since it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics with her plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and of undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on her attack on the alleged Chequers plan for Brexit, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge the other's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Wayde's murder: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year LSU basketball player during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for second-degree homicide, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made public a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, CBS subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, the police say they admitted to shooting Wayde.
A bond of $350,000 has been established, depending on the defense.
Baton Rouge District Instruction Judge This published a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Luisian State Police unit, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's sports director, thanked the police forces in the area for his "deligence and search for justice".
Sims was 20.
The player, who was over two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU.
He had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one part of the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, declared that his team is "devastated" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"These are the things people are always concerned about," Wade said.
An ashtray volcano in Mexico City
Ceniza from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The centre recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social networks, images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicals have observed greater activity in the volcano, 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters faced riots while thousands of people participated in opposing demonstrations coincidentally with the first anniversary of the polarized referendum in Catalonia on the secession.
A group of hooded separatists who the antidisturbs had cut the pace threw eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours, and the police used rallies to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independent groups, with messages such as "not forgotten nor forgiven", faced unionist demonstrators with the cry of "Viva España".
Fourteen people were cared for by mild injuries suffered during the protests, depending on local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the vote on 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but held by Catalan separatists.
The voters elected independence by overwhelming majority, although participation was low, as the people against the secession boycotted the referendum to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent voting at polling stations throughout the region, where violent clashes occurred.
The independence groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had hope that Catalonia would be independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry of joy for being able to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, though narrow, in the regional elections of last December, the pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, since many of their best known leaders, whether in self-imposed or detained exile, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"To be a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen of the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for chewing a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly hitting a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday around 7:30 in Ballynegard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was done to access and to the building itself.
At some point, he may have shot himself in the car with a ballet.
A Menga attack awards 1-0 victory to Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers with winning the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the Hebox club.
The attack by Dolly Menga marked the difference. Gary Holt's members went up one post, with the Hibernian in second position.
This season, Gerrard's have not yet won any out-of-home victory and next Sunday they face Hearts, eight-point board leaders.
Earlier, Rangers received Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, the Livingston widens its share of victories in the division to six parties. Holt, the incumbent coach, has not yet tasted defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets go through opportunities in front of a strong visitor
Holt's team had to have gone one step forward long before marking, causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson passed the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the door. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow got shot diverted after he entered to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the door.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble to visitors with the ball games stopped.
That's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an entrance, with a combined play of Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated possession, but they couldn't pass the host's defense and the doorman, Liam Kelly, was quite quiet.
That game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Allan McGregor, Ranger's porter rejected a shot of Scott Pittman from a kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another livingston game.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly entering, but they were always cleared. Two requests for penalty were rejected, one after a Halkett entry on alternate Glenn Middleton and another by one hand.
Livingston Phenomenal (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an ascending path.
His style of play and his template have hardly experienced changes since his ascension, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they stayed short.
They failed to materialize their moves, as they only managed to get into the opposite field once, which is a call of attention to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Later, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police alleged security reasons to prevent 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers stood in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents from Erdogan, many of them Kurdish, were also heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisible this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded road from Deptford, to the south-east of the city, about 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was cared for by the paramedics, but died there.
The accident occurs after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that escaped to Childers Street, almost two kilometers from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family.
The roads have been cut off and the buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Wounded After Disturbing
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation in a high-security prison for men, according to the Directorate of the Prison.
The riots started in Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and still continue.
Specialists of an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, involving eight interns and affecting a pavilion.
Officers were assisted by mild-faced injuries on the spot.
A spokesperson for prison services commented: "Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing Long Lartin prison incident.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be placed in the hands of the police and could spend more time between bars."
Long Lartin prison accommodates more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disturbing agents were asked to go to prison to deal with a serious clash in which prison personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City With Sudden Floods (Arid Areas Might Be Benefited)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week next when the last collections of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest of the desert, at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued alerts for sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada and south-east California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rains at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented on a tweet that only ten hurricanes had kept their tropical storm or depression on a radius of 321 kilometres from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre provide between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rains, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Shoe in Arizona.
It is likely that they fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden floods, the rains of Rosa may be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported atweather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north to 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected that it will land in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"A torrential rain of between 7 and 15 centimeters from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora is expected to reach 25 centimeters", as reported at weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Subsequently, she will move along Arizona south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or his remains is the heavy torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert," says the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and streams of debris in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after he had met another 16-year-old with white gun wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-and 20-year-old was arrested that same night in the Radstock area in Avon, according to the Somerset Police.
Agents have appealed to anyone who might have recorded what happened with the mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "suffered the Mesquiness and the Wrath" of the Democratic Party
"Voting in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in a rally held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the Mesquintity and the Wrath" of the Democratic Party throughout the whole appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, the "Americans saw Kavanaugh's cunning, quality and courage."
"Voting to confirm judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most successful legalists today, a jurist with an admirable record in the service of the public," he told his West Virginia followers.
The President made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy by discussing the importance of Republican participation in elections in mid-term.
"It takes five weeks for one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't introduce myself, but it's a career," he said.
"That's why I'm going from one place to another fighting to get big candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are engaged in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place not later than Friday, a high position was reported by the leadership of the Republican Party to the CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in an earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, the figure is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves that hit the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the town of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters arrived at the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying it all at their own pace.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When it was announced yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims," said Sutope Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB) in Indonesia, in a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, all that was on the ground," Nugroho said. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had gone up to the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and the damage could be greater along the 300 km of coast north of Palu, an area called Domanga, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Domanga, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 people," said the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although those responsible said that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by a amateur and shared social media, a man is heard who was on the last floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the coast, rising in front of buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large blackout that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities declared, but evacuated people still need food and other commodities.
The city airport has reopened itself for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims for the Indonesian tsunami is greater than 800.
It's really bad.
Although World Vision Domanga staff have arrived in the city of Palu, where employees are sheltered under canvases installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It's really bad.
Even while the aid groups were launching disaster assistance gears, some people regretted that the displacement of highly experienced cooperatives to Palu was not being allowed.
According to Indonesian legislation, only foreign funding, supplies and staffing may be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a catastrophe at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As soon as the Government says it considers it to be a national disaster, we can start providing international assistance, but it has not yet happened."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of people who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that brought some light to the despicable stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, instructor of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had formed two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagei, were his students.
"By my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the disclosure of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to the contestants of Palu, who participated in the festival that was held at the beach.
However, their messages only showed a check mark in grey, not two in blue.
"I think that means the messages didn't deliver," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during a recharge of an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves attacked a Brink employee who was charging an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee, bringing $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an automatic cashier located in the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote on the note.
While he was busy, another man "approached behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for charging.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the place, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
The kidnapper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West".
For some time now West, 41 years old, is named Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons", as the programme creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that the word was of religious importance to him.
"I think it's the most commonly used word in the Bible, where you mean 'you'," West commented early this year while talking about the album's title with the Big Boy radio speaker.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
It's gone from being Kanye, which means 'the only one', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in upper case letters or lower case letters, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to suppress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when student movements from the left were intensifying throughout Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to become part of criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research investment in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I.A.'s professional and investor who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments then emerge from I.A. announcements from several parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
"Dupplicating the research budget for I.A. would be a good start, since all other countries go far behind the US we have the look at the next advance in the field of I.A.," says Lee.
Double funding means twice as many possibilities for the next major achievement in I.A. to be achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that won the best U.S. player in Othello. Subsequently, he was executive in Microsoft Research and president of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee gave recognition to the U.S. government's previous technological competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would allow the next generation of visionaries to be identified.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to obtain government subsidies, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired leading university people to work in I.A.
Lee commented that changes in migration policy could also help the U.S. to intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Development Plan for the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China funds individuals from academic institutions as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations finance U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Center of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners from the industrial and academic fields. For its part, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research of I.A.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that sought to create a National Committee on Artificial Intelligence Security has not carried out any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether they're going to change their country's name
The people of Macedonia decided on a referendum held on Sunday whether their name would change to "North Macedonia Republic", a gesture that would resolve a conflict of decades with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name is a claim from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, a majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether the participation will reach the minimum of 50 % required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The paper of the referendum raised the following question: "Is it in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, a number of Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote so that it will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported in the afternoon.
However, participation was only 16 %, compared with 34 % of the last elections to Parliament held in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters deposited their votes.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote in the Macedonia referendum on a change of name of the country that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and removed chairs from the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our head high, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter into Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that accession to NATO would provide much-needed investment in Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 %.
"I think the great majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing their vote.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future."
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, it was ensured that between 30 and 43% of voters were to participate in the referendum, which means that they were less than required to participate.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, this would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, avoids the entire Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal at minute 65.
The Argentine midpoint received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the move.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He avoided a defense before crossing several more at the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English front used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with the right foot to avoid the doorman Mathew Ryan with a shot that got to the right side of the network.
"Agüero has some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola, coach of the City, to journalists.
"We talked about it playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that time."
However, it was Sterling that gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League contest.
The goal arrived in the 29th minute.
In that move, Agüero received the balloon inside Brighton's territory.
He made a nice balloon pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some touches before he headed to Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky blues front threw the balloon into the network just before he left the limits.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a group party of the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals eliminated from the gameoff struggle, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the ever competitive Scherzer expects to step on the monticle on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, they won against Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard post thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that Denver's audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hand history is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Trump gives a rally to West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, speaking of the importance of republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November everything we have done is at stake.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the most important. I don't introduce myself, but it's a career, so I go from place to place fighting for big candidates," he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see mischief, wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to pass over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are engaged in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"We've seen it these last four days," he said, saying the Democrats "were angry, they were evil, horrible and false."
He referred to the Judicial Commission of the Senate appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the public's beatings.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for an answer. Her body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of views.
It's intolerant with people who say what they think
When my local party Momentum activists voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a row of Members of the Labour Party's Parliament to whom it is said not to be welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was given a treatment that seemed to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe. It is ironic that these were matters in which Jeremy was at odds with previous leaders.
As was stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years in which I have been a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what were the night meetings of the General Committee on Friday.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "kinder and kinder" policy is already forgotten, if it really applied at some point.
It is increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether or not the party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a slide of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a stream of sexist or racist insults every day, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of views and, with each motion "of censorship" or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received many advice that recommended me to keep my head low and not make me hear so much and that so "it would be okay."
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a high school student, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my entire school class literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a councilman or as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for someone in Nottingham East to ignore my political stances or areas in which he did not agree with the current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted the Friday motion is that I do not understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader when the country heads a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: An Invicto Ayr climbs to the top
Two trials at the end of the party may have decided to some extent the final result, but no doubt Ayr deserved victory in this very entertaining game of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
Now they head the table and it is the only invicto team of the ten who participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to take better advantage of the opportunities, which gave victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been tested in all the parties and we're still intoxicated, so I have to be glad," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented: "The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of better opportunities than we did."
Grant Anderson's trial at minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, placed the Ayr in front; but a yellow card to Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan to the party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot obtained an unconverted trial.
Clima extended the advantage of Ayr with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of time, he marked and turned a solo trial, which left the marker in 17-5 in favor of Ayr at rest.
However, the Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption by a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who had to pull out on a camel, and, upon resumption of the party, the Ayr moved forward with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, Captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to return to take advantage of having one more man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the premises recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for plating Clima without the balloon, from the penalti line, MacPherson did a test when he was in the back of the mall that was moving forward.
Climo turned it, as he had been doing almost since the party resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent Gregor Henry to the bottom to do the fifth essay of the premises.
Still Game's protagonist wants to steer his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move to the restaurant sector after it has been revealed that he has been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC program, who writes and co-protagonizes with his comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to make any comment on the matter, although a source of Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "florent restoration market".
"The sea belongs to us": a landlocked Bolivia has the hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors watch a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, marine blue flags are waved.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Retrieve it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly recall the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the desire to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a resolution of the International Court of Justice by 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens distributed throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague court will take action in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is waging a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the resolution of the International Court of Justice arrives only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Chilean expert Paz Zárate in international law.
Far from promoting Bolivia's cause, it may have been hampered by the past four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
He also suggested that Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold conversations after this.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would use the maritime theme as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless I can trust the United States.
Mr. Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said that his nation would never be the first to complete nuclear disarmament if he could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when Mike Pompey, US Secretary of State, seems to be about to resume diplomatic talks on paralysed nuclear matter over three months after this summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration that ends with the Korean War to submit to the North, is a "burner".
Washington is afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament movement first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness of renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the delegates.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, don't look any more.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a large set of eccentric hats for their 2019 spring collection on the gateway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other large-sized plugs were jewelry sandstones, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sharp lips and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than the high seam.
One creation reminded a complete diving team, snorkel and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're lucky.
The hunters in style predict that huge hats could begin to appear on the street stores.
The big hats come hand-strengthened from "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wingspan of more than 60 cm used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind this so impractical hat that flooded social networks presented another great creation on the gateway: a straw beach bag as large as the model in bath that carried it.
The dark orange raffle bag, decorated with raffia flakes and a white leather handle, was the main part of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for the spring-summer 2019 season in the Fashion Week of Paris.
As the famous designer Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags in the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large additions."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental to the citizens of the world
The independent educational centres of Scotland have a history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the examinations that are reinforced by the individual and collective successes collected in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent colleges are designed to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, he reaches his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's reviews, we can see that languages are at the highest level of the classification tables, being the highest approved rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students studying foreign languages received an A, the highest grade.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS centres showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages by considering them a fundamental competency that both children and young people will need in the future without a doubt.
Currently, as a subject, languages are considered to be at the same level as CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that, of the reasons given by entrepreneurs for the difficulties in filling jobs, 17% were attributed to the shortage of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last forever.
The ability to communicate directly with persons from foreign countries will enable that person to automatically advance to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to keep a conversation. Moreover, it was established that the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If you know a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools, you can always choose between several languages provided by teaching staff specialized in this field.
The independent educational centres in Scotland devote all their efforts to provide a learning environment that prepares children and that teams with the necessary skills to succeed, whatever lies ahead for them.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "competences for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron starts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The hope of fans hoping to see LeBron James debut in his first party with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will play the opening party of the pre-timed event that will be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes you are going to play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell posted in a tweet that James was likely to play a few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-party pre-time program of Lakers.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-time matches to prepare myself," he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled matches for the next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court pending, Trump seeks support for the next half-period elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 tonight, Saturday September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the appearances of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who were tense because of the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and have left pending an early Senate confirmation vote for, at most, a week while the FBI investigates them.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans who face the November elections to push.
Thus, President Trump's campaign pointed out that the five next week's meetings aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they retain in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is so crucial to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we go into the campaign," said Reuters, a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to give his name.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena Stadium tonight's rally could attract supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have coverage in the Pittsburgh media," as reported by West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is falling behind in the polls.
"For Morrisey it's not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows that it dares to fight to keep alive the hope of individual Sunday parties.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse oscillating pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So where would you say the impulse is now?
"They took us six points of advantage and now they take us four, so I guess that can be considered a little boost," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel that they have some wind in favor and other reasons to be excited, among other reasons by the couple made up of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and preach with the example.
The gourds of celebration went up by volume as his round advanced, introducing a vital putt to tie up the fourth game when he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the match in the 15th was received with a similar scream, of those who transmit that they believe that the American team has not yet left out.
"What needs to be done to redouble efforts and focus on the party," Spieth said.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple in Europe has four of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That crack and the way it flows its energy with the bullying public make it clear that these are the players to be won on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, the two at the same time in different holes.
Still, it remains premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio García, the four-ball hero in the morning after forming a partner with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried Spanish and Swedish in a hole they couldn't get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and ants are fascinating to see them closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a great advantage over the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe is advanced by 10-6 the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leaves with a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing fourballs and ants with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated two composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was seen in trouble, advancing four points in the classification of Le Golf National.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the ants, winning two parties, but did not manage to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the nickname of "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, his magnificent union served to defeat a despondent Woods and American novelist Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, which in the two games on Saturday had not highlighted too much, had occasional moments of brightness, but has now lost 19 of its 29 fourball and foursome matches, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning fourballs, was again Henrik Stenson's partner in the ants, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a result 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
Three times the winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as reference to the Americans, obtaining two points on Saturday.
They won a passionate 2-1 victory against the Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two initial holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, that a team recovers from a difference of four points in individual matches has only happened twice, though Furyk, as trophy owner, only needs a draw to preserve it.
Although they have been the best seconds for two days, it seems to carry out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says that "there is no possibility" of unilateral disarmament if they do not have confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened its mistrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated to the annual General Assembly of the international agency that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing itself to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we received no similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security, and, in those circumstances, there's no possibility that we should first unilaterally disarmament."
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a "by-stage" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it makes gradual steps, its statement is important, since it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump ensured North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls for the smoothing of international sanctions to North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even by objecting to a declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced to bomb and plate by the United Nations leader at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, leader of South Korea, over the past five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the interested party in denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stagnation."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea's missiles to US soil after the "major president" Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim "man rocket".
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "destruct completely" North Korea last year, praised Kim for her courage in advancing towards disarmament, but said that much remained to be done and that sanctions needed to continue until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, no matter."
China and Russia allege that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue vigorously and without failure until we realize the final and fully verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for the Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo talked with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea reported that his "requirements were those of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "relative measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "relative measures" he was looking for were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course this year at Harvard University, all university students sleep more in an attempt to fight against the growing machist culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found out that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, it is believed that his first class in the United States.
His motivation to start the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached me and asked why she just learned about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," The Telegraph commented.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one hour course of duration includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of the lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of infarction, embolism, depression and cancer.
Afterwards, an icon of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know you're not going to change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco," said Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride for "to spend the night sailing" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure that students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough time and a good quality dream should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students consider putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having problems to stay asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal tombs Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside the house, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibox wanted to win their first home win since February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team eight points from the Hearts, unleashed leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack took place minutes before the mid-time and the uninspired alignment of the Rangers was not at all at the height.
Now, the Rangers are down to sixth position, the Livingston goes up to third, behind the Hibernian for the difference in goals.
The Rangers may find themselves with more problems, as the Calum Spence line judge had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly throws an object from the visitor's background.
Gerrard changed eight of the headlines that won the party against the Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scotland League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 Livingston players who pulled a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his very organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the balloon when he had it.
They should have marked it two minutes from the beginning, when Menga made a pass into space for Scott Pittman who passed through the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the middle camper sent him out.
Keaghan Jacobs made a deep lack for Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in the defense, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out for the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized at minute 15 of the game, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but arbitrator Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian request.
The Rangers got two shots to the door in the first half, but the old porter of Hebox, Liam Kelly, hardly found himself in trouble to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal marked at minute 34 by Livingston came against all predictions, no one can deny that they deserved it because of the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to face a deep ball game stopped by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher laced the ball for Scott Robinson, who was calm and passed by Menga to score the goal.
At the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an impact almost immediately, as the steering wheel passed it to Morelos, but impressive Kelly left his line to block it.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors to exactly the type of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's could have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a corner that did not enter.
The Rangers substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the party after a meeting with Jacobs, but once again Thomson looked elsewhere.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTENDING... was born in Germany the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as Geiger counter.
Count Geiger, who since then is a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Crown bells", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans on seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting your headphones on, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactive activity of minerals."
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to age 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw how her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a dialogue in favor of Trump with a MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was ambushed in the Saturday Night Live study after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would be presented for the elections in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he began to despot the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
"I often talk to someone white and wonder how I can like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have gone from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started Matt Damon's sketch show in which Hollywood's star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate's Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcasted, comic Chris Rock went up recording West's bronca on social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that he had been wrong behind bars for wearing that hat.
"They messed with me.
They told me not to go out with the hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and he added, "I was going to put on his superman coat, because that meant that no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments received public shells on at least two occasions and members of SNL appeared to be ashamed, according to Variety. One person said to the magazine: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapist Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many when he went to the stage to sing I Love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from conservative leader TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: Thank you for resisting MUCHEMBER."
Karen Hunter, an interviewer, tweeted that West was just "being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I decide NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes, or supporting his art) who I think is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology to my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed, saying it was now "the person previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Chargé d'état de stabilamento en una restaurant de Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday in the Belfast Trial Chamber.
Prosecutor's office will review charges.
Harington Kit, Tronos Gamestar, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for its role as Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasy of the HBO, Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that these on-screen roles often passed on to young boys who had to be hard to respect.
In an interview given to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in Tronos Game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that it seems "sufficiently important" to address this issue.
"Personally, it seems pretty important to me right now, where have we been wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking of the problems they see now?"
Kit believes that television can have part of the responsibility for growing toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, which makes young people feel that they have to be this particular form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that it is "harvest of battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will star True West, Sam Shepard's play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he thinks knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever gotten out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of the character of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series awarded with Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on a farm of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more than new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which implies a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of an infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced in practice entirely, declared the Chinese health authorities at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the LGTB community in China.
Homosexuality was desecrated in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffers from much discrimination.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are not to use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to drugs against HIV as part of an attempt to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a member of his staff leaking data from Republican Party senators and asserts that it is "dangerous minds" and "theories of conspiracy"
Representative Maxine Waters criticized on Saturday the allegations that one member of his staff had published personal data from three U.S. Senators of the Republican Party on Wikipedia's pages on legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that these accusations were driven by commentators and "right end" websites.
"Mention, lies and more vile lies," Waters commented in a Twitter post.
The published information allegedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol published information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration was at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was by no means responsible for filtration of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
The Waters statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"Deals this information with anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that not the timing necessary to be a Member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He mustn't rebel.
He should not question the defendant ' s motives.
You must maintain calm and serenity."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction with the Democrats' criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of being too angry during Thursday's appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to unbank Waters in mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted “the relevant authorities and entities responsible for enforcing the law of these fraudulent accusations”.
"We will ensure that the authors are discovered," he continued, "and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English Criticism: Again in Action. Rowan Atkinson’s spy parody is short
Now it has become a tradition to search for foxes to Brexit into any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what it is like to do with this new delivery of the parodic franchise of action and comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satisfying about how clearly fired we are the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes jumping and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to kick for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than nothing, it is a comical creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to overthrow glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind that touched a single note on the topic of Fire Cars that was touched at the inauguration ceremony of the London Olympic Games 2012.
In addition, in its origin it was based on the mysterious traveling and international man represented by Atkinson years ago on Barclaycard's already forgotten TV ads, sowing chaos behind it.
In this last delivery, there is one or two good moments.
I loved to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor as the propellers hit the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps to the eye, but humor stays rather short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that franchises of "serious" films like 007 and impossible Mission add comical ingredients without problems.
Humor seems more directed to children than to adults and, for me, Johnny English's absurd misfortunes are not as ingenious and accurate as Atkinson's silent jokes in Mr. Bean's role.
Now, the repeated current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated Britain's supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the dismay of the agent on duty, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that fills the glass for the Prime Minister, a pompous and curly character who is watching its political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives the best of itself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room to work.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as all active spies are at risk, you will have to resort to someone who is withdrawn.
That has to be the Johnny English torpeo, which now teaches in a pijo school, although it gives out-of-office classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since it is a spying academy similar to that of Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his suffering old compinche Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice paper for whom Vicki Pepperdine is not taking sufficient advantage of.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a multimillionaire charisma in the world of technology that claims he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hatred of absurd situations: they dress up as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, destabilize chaos by hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; moreover, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get familiar with the interior of the Volta house.
Definitely, they were used in full in that last sequence, but, however funny and harsh it is, the set continues to convey a somewhat infantile feeling.
A pretty regular product.
Like Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would bring real justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the owners of the companies to save the savings obtained through the revolution in artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
As the sources point out, the idea would "encray" on the party's plans and economic agenda of tilting the country in favour of workers.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a high-ranking Labour Party commented on The Sunday Times: An announcement of a directive review is expected before the end of the year.
"It will not be achieved from one day to another, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter which the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy for the worker, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support these types of ideas, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its 2017 general election campaign.
At the moment, however, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not part of the party's policy and will not be discussed at this time."
The shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to present his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to regain powers from "anonymous directors" and "utilized" companies that provide public services.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also include the idea that current water company shareholders do not recover their full participation, as a labour government could apply deductions that correspond to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers in business boards and to create inclusive property funds where 10 % of private sector companies' shares are to be allocated to employees, which would involve annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation around Kavanaugh and if I could make them change their mind
The FBI investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for confirmation as a Supreme Court judge for at least one week, and further raises the question of whether the results concluded could influence a Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be delivered on Sunday, the journalist of "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham talk about whether the FBI could bring out information that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course, of course," Kennedy said.
"I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the claim came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, resolute, tacit."
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation," he said.
"Dra.Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it very much," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she appoints have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Did you manage to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star sign is gathered for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will move to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay for a VIP entry), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or anything else that will serve to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved at 12 years of age to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of so-called "clectivism", which is called the posture that we adopt when we think we are doing something really useful by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favour of a large number of diverse objectives.
Thanks to these actions, they claim that world leaders announced commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2250 million people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", an association of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with all their potential." To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after more than 5000 actions were carried out to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a collaborator from Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as previously achieved the human rights movement and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the events we will count on at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade on Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretariat
"If necessary," Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as published in Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at legitimate government bodies, is only a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe," he said.
Moreover, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "Energy Consumer's Voice" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington holds in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are in fact the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia basically consists of using and replacing fuels," he warned while pointing out that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been attempting to drive the export of its natural gas liquefied to Europe and to relieve it of its function to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration members, including Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a Moscow hostage.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which amounts to $11 billion, is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington's fierce opposition to the project only responds to economic reasons and is a further example of unfair competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Energy Secretary last September in Moscow.
The US position has, however, been met with the rejection of Germany, who has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization leading the industry in Germany, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a meeting that was recently held between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibility of becoming a candidate for the presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will consider joining the presidential race after the elections in mid-term.
During a meeting in the City Council of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
"It is time for women to arrive in Washington to amend our fractured government and finally have women among the leaders," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting myself as a candidate for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the City Hall and said he was " taking the wrong way to the country."
"I really worry about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke without cover about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren stated that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
On Thursday, a survey was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that it should be submitted for the 2020 elections.
58% of the “possible” voters from Massachusetts stated that the senator should not be presented, according to the survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
However, 32% of respondents supported their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for 2020 of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, as reported by the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's posttraumatic stress disorder in a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"The situation that is going through my son, for all that has happened since he returned, is well known to other families who suffer the effects of the TEPT and other injuries with which our soldiers return," he told the public that he gathered himself in a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo of which no one wants to talk about, and commented about his son and other war veterans who "return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really exists such respect for what his fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all other members of the army, have given their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the Columbia District support a judicial remedy to the new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" writing in Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" submitted in August by the US Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gangs.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Migration Appeals Board (BIA) whereby undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could seek asylum in this country.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine made statements on Friday stating that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
"According to federal legislation, all asylum applications must be failed by virtue of the particular facts and circumstances of the demand and, instead, this exception violates that principle," the amicus curiae points out.
The lawyers also indicated in the writing that the policy that denies entry to immigrants is detrimental to the U.S. economy by claiming that they often become entrepreneurs more often and "assuming a necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"They may seek asylum for persons leaving their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats by race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions when he announced this directive on 11 June.
Asylum has never been created as a measure to alleviate all problems, not even all serious problems, faced by people around the world on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while increasing the number of deaths in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to console her baby with fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed houses to search out among the few dregs that remain in an effort to recover what is possible to them.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to continuous replicas, also very strong.
He could not help crying when he told us about the violent earthquake he lived while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to stay safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the collapsed wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
US Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propagandistic announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump made reference to China Daily's payment supplement in Des Moines Register, Iowa's most selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to join the United States Congress elections on 6 November, something that China strongly denies.
The accusation that Trump launched about Beijing's attempt to influence U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials pointed to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently being blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in imports by both sides.
China's compensatory tariffs applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall into exporters of states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and the former Governor of Iowa, who is one of China’s leading agricultural exporters, said Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to Branstad in an opinion article at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is further intensifying this pressure with advertising publications in our free press."
"To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and free press when trying to publish a payment announcement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few conflicting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China may have about the worrying trajectory that is taking the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China eluded the offer to publish" his article, although it did not specify what newspaper it was about.
Analysts point out that Republicans are distanced from women before the vote in half of the legislature with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many renowned Republicans are closing ranks in favour of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a retreat, especially by women, can occur in the forthcoming half-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have shown that they want to continue with the vote.
"In such matters it is not possible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, at The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last attempt to stand up for the FBI's investigation would be sufficient to calm the disgruntled voters with this matter.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington newspaper D.C.
Friday morning, the protesters who gathered at the gates of the Senate were "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) at the moment the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the candidacy of Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to Mic.
"The zeal and motivation of the Democrats comes out of all predictions," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
"People say that the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even greater, especially among the indecisive women in the suburbs and the younger voters, between 18 and 29 years of age, who do not usually vote even if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he had his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that there could be a reversal if Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This matter has become a great mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the previous president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is no longer just a question of the committee's vote or the final vote, not even if they sit in the bank to Kavanaugh; it is also a matter of how Republicans have handled all this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helps in the election of Democrats).
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who put themselves on the latter side.
In a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents are said to believe the Ford testimonial in a definitive or probable way, while 35% claim to believe Kavanaugh in a definitive or probable way.
In addition, 38% claimed that they thought that Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her being drunk at the age of 17.
For his part, Ramirez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest technology legend project. A company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"It has to be now," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is unique in personal online data storage is that the user is the one who fully decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data."
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
For the moment, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the developers included in a template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technological developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change will be introduced where all their business models are completely modified from day to day.
"We're not gonna ask permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has played a very important role in the debate on network neutrality.
Even though I am launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew they had granted him the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made his grandfather deserve to be decorated.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the "greater courage", made the line advance before reaching a cannon with one hand and to bring down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions he carried out his grandfather were "so great that I will never be able to reach his height, but they were very attractive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, which included the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and he added that "the value of a true hero is clear when he is shown such numerous backing."
MMA's followers were awake all night for the Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that he stays all night awake to see the whole Bellator 206 so that they won't finally let him see the main event.
The San José cartel had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the United Kingdom it was going to broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face, United Kingdom viewers were amazed when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised when they had to stay awake until the first hour of the morning just to see the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the shift to cartoons as "a heavy joke".
"There is a government regulation that regulates the content issued from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to the programming of children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Peppa la pigita," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were going to modify the program to include British viewers in the next editions.
"When I think of the broadcast option, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our hour, which would already be Monday to them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise that next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we have usually done. We try to offer more than usual so that fans were happy and we passed.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumphant.
At age 24, he told us he didn't realize until he got to high school that "they weren't all like me."
In the first programme of Desert Island Radio Discs 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that his intention to talk about gay rights was to transmit "hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him begin to lose importance in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be away for a few months by illness.
In Laverne's first program, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "lower" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked boys and girls."
He said, "So far, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what really given me the power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he did not disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year's Commonwealth Games held in Australia to claim that more countries despean homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt fortunate to live free, without reprisals, and wanted to transmit that "hope" to others.
The world's three-time champion stated that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year to the winner of an Oscar, who has been 20 years old, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so much since you were so young" (it was at your first 14-year-old Olympic Games and your father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone as old as you were.
The couple had a child in June who they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie."
His son is called his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was whether they had the passes to London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wasn't able to tell him I wasn't going to be able to be in the front row," he said.
"He had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that precise moment he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of my whole life: competing in the pool in front of mine at some Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud of Heather Small, who accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He was still wearing chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Miccelson, in low shape, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his way if he wants to avoid becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event that is held every two years to get a record for the 12th time, was disbanded by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has so many times done for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to conform to cheering in a few moments and, in others, try to perfect his game in the field and thus be able to correct what afflicts him.
Never the most direct driver, not even at the highest point in his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best way for the Le Golf National field, where the long rush punishes continuously with wrong blows.
And, if the camp is no longer disheartening enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game of Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games that have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below at the beginning of the 12 individual matches, were to start in an impressive way, the Miccelson party could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, he couldn't say much more either.
"He understood perfectly the role he had today, he slapped me in the back and, surrounding me with his arm, he said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of self-confidence.
He's in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought they'd be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's brand of more games played by the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a whole path of Ryder Cups that had never so clearly equaled the levels of its individual brand.
Miccelson has 18 cattle, 20 lost and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence contributed much more intangible values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, resourceful, he likes to make fun of others; it's great to have him on the team," he explained.
"I think younger players have been happy to have it as a support, too this week; it was fun.
It brings much more than just playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you come with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 Valderrama match, where a band led by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to end the others by weighing their heels for a minimum margin, winning 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You don't stop remembering that we did a big tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won it, but for very little while," Bjorn said, portrayed, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are on the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no less or more, than the best players in the world."
Proud of what their players have done in a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to move forward.
Tomorrow's a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, you test your entire ability as a golfer.
That is the message that should be passed on to the players, getting the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now it's time to put your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself."
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as couples, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both extremes in the last days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won in Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Mirinath Miracle".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did on Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIllroy in the main party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole tour," Bjorn said about their individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least the next year due to faulty systems and the progressive increase of costs, reported the local media.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship leading the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, some statements by a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery upset the completion of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that requested the Navy in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
We know that they will include a powerful canyon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar signals, infrareds and very small acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project their power overseas) to be already outdated when they start serving, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 held headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if it was sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the personnel in the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has an excessive surplus, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The 7000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, has also caused a problem.
It is believed that it has reached the €31 billion (3600 million), instead of the initial €22 billion.
The problems facing the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings on the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is "remaining without ships capable of deploying".
The officer said that the problem has worsened over time, because old ships were discharged, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, attempts to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything is expected to shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano bats, as well as the Daubenton river bats and long-eared browns of the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special tape recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds that are collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of bat calls and what species do.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed image of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests for bats and other associated species should be maintained.
The bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electric wiring may also pose a risk to them, as well as insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the theme of bats very seriously.
He has ten trained experts in the field, who are dedicated to regularly conducting surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescues.
The organization has inaugurated even the first and only reserve dedicated to Scotland bats in the state of Thraveve in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the proper habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, since an infant colony can be accidentally destroyed and 400 females and females could be killed, which would mean killing a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said, "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species that we don't know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies complaints of rape at the same time as his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has listed rape complaints as "fake news", and says people "want to get to know themselves" at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to denounce the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were issued.
In front of Portugal and Juventus he was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of paying him $375,000 to hide the incident, as Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With a video from Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, 33-year-old Ronaldo, tached the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball looking at the camera.
"They only want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as ever.
They want to be famous for just mentioning me, but that's it, I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a suit to Der Spiegel for the charges that appear in what they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy," Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will try to get compensation for "moral damage due to a amount corresponding to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
It seems that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her annually, according to documents recorded in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga declared that Ronaldo bent down after the supposed incident and told him that it was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had cheated on that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consented.
Majorga also claims she went to the police and took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she had "terror of reprisals" and was concerned "to be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman states that she is trying to cancel the agreement, since she remains traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has changed to Juve, a big Italian football for a contract of €100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will regret all life" if it lost its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worry" that Toyota UK informed the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production would temporarily be stopped at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact on customs delays in the case of an unagreed Brexit could result in loss of work.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production breaks in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have shown their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he will close his Mini plant at Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns referred to by car manufacturers revolve around the problems that could arise in assembly chains in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
The Toyota production line is based on the adjusted mode of production (just in time or at the last moment), where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to manufacture cars by charge.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there could be an interruption at the border which, according to the sector, could result in delays and the depletion of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day's inventory on its Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in this case, production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is "calibrated precisely to avoid these controls at border crossings".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the passage right now but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what has so far been a tremendously successful supply chain set."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would stop, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce plant competitiveness and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union union on the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover."
A government spokesperson said, "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that delineates our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with vice-fiscal general Rod Rosenstein could "possess himself another week", as the dispute continues on the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in Russian elections, links between help from Trump and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation before Trump decides to fire the vice-fiscal general or not and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fueled Washington's cottages for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the talks he had with Trump with a microphone he himself was carrying to try to deny the president by way of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it to be true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, among news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump (now in the United Nations in New York) on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to postpone to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday in Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been defined, it could be this week or another, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and I will inform the press, as I usually do."
Some journalists would refute that statement: Sanders has not held any press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what were the reasons.
Sanders said that the shortage of press wheels was not due to an aversion to TV journalists who are acting with great precision, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are bragging."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president carries out more questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, while he quoted without evidence: "We have contrasted those numbers."
Press conference will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "If the press has the option to ask the president of the United States directly, I think it's much better than making them to me.
We tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only occur on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why he was like this, where he made an unbridled appearance and, at times, strange, before the journalists gathered there.
The Health Secretary of State writes to the EU workers of NHS Scotland about their fears at Brexit
The Secretary of State of Health has written to the EU staff working in the HHS of Scotland to express the country's gratitude and its desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of applications for citizenship for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the way out of which the expected decisions were chosen this autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible scenario in which there would be no agreement.
I know all this must be very confusing for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Professionals across the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to keep counting on you."
Christion Abercrombie is being operated urgently after a head wound
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee player State Tigers was surgically intervened after a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed informed journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"I came to the band and collapsed right there," Reed said.
Both coaches and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing it on a camel and taking him to be examined in depth.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the camp, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher tax on the transfer of land when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be subject to a higher tax of land transmission when they purchase a property in the United Kingdom and the extra money collected by this measure will be used to provide shelter to "no ceilings" according to the new plans of the conservatives
Change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in farm tax will be imposed on those persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year for "no ceiling"
The additional money collected with the increase of farm tax to foreign property buyers in the United Kingdom will be used for "no ceiling" aid, announced today Theresa May.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and bullying those with higher incomes.
The increase in farm tax will be charged to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be intended to encourage government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The charge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, also including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the buy-to-let system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the most wealthy areas in the country (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large builders of maintaining very high prices on property when buying avidly land without intending to use it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "disgruntled housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of evictions without cause.
It also proposes to grant the local authorities more power to build new housing.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of each new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to drive Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says that his "primary objective" is to become a coach in Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the club in the north-east, which currently occupies the third position in the League One (the third division of leagues in England), three points from the first.
He passed to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat," Ross told Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it's something he always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become reality, however, if I succeed in running a club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's leader include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he went to such established names in such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment, the success for me is measured according to whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can return to the club where it should be."
Ross has only been practicing as a coach for three years, after being a time assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts technical body.
Later, he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren turn from being at the edge of the descent to win the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Probably it was a real crusade," he recalled in reference to the time when the Alloa was taken over.
"I always thought the address was the best thing I was going to do, much more than play.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I could make a very good living with it and enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure from that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I've managed to do it, it's the time of my adult life in which I've felt better, without any doubt."

According to one survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday
The heat wave of summer has driven the profits in the British pubs who struggle to survive, but focused all the pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while the profits of the restaurants fell by 4.8%, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Consultancy, who was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World has made that in July the pattern of the previous month of June, in which the pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although restaurants have fallen even more.
The drop of 1,8% in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their strongest month, in front of most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered with heat, although not as drastic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out and drink.
In the bar and pubs managed, the sales of beverages increased by up to 6,6% during the month, while the meals decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of the hosting and leisure analysts at SMR, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in sales on the market of activities outside the home.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although the fall of 4,8% in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long and warm summer could not have come at a worse time for gastronomy operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK's restaurant, bar and pub sector, the performance data of 47 operating groups are collected and analysed, with a combined billing of over £9 billion and is the market reference value.
One in five children have secret accounts on social networks behind their parents
One out of five children (some even 11 years old) have secret accounts on social networks behind their parents and teachers, as revealed by a survey
The survey, conducted to 20,000 high school students, revealed growth on the fake Instagram pages
News has exacerbated fears that sexual content should be published
20% of students claimed to have a "primary" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years of age) creates accounts on social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a reference site for photo sharing.
News has exacerbated fears that sexual content should be published.
Some 20 per cent of the students said they had a "main" healthy account that showed their parents, while they had other privates.
A mother who happened to encounter her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how one teenager encouraged others to "violate me."
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent colleges, found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voting of athletes" in the Scottish athletic federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to become a member of the Scottish athletic federation directive as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning track and field athlete in Scotland and his president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want sport to benefit from its great international experience in the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletic community of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland will benefit greatly by counting on it in its directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I like to be the spokesman of athletes and I hope to be able to deliver things and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert at the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or how much.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing exercises of agility.
Thanks for the messages and words of courage!"
The announcement of the hooves where it compares to mothers with cows divides to the opinion on the Internet
A scrapie company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement where it compares to mothers who give their breast with cows to whom they order.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "first silent scraps of the world", the technology company for the consumer Elvie published an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video showing some mothers who tell the freedom that the new milk extractor gives them.
Four royal women dance in a barn full of hay in dance floor mode, along with some cows, with letters like, "Yes, I sort myself alone, but I don't have tail" and "If you haven't noticed it, they're not open, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Order them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, I'm ordering my women."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has created a huge controversy.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to announce this product.
Like us, you have to get pregnant before you give birth in order to produce milk, except that they take away your babies days after birth," wrote one person.
The Elvie milk extractor is discreetly adapted into a lactation strainer (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "There's a more bewildered announcement."
However, others defended the announcement, as a woman who admitted that the song was "deternal."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still did breast-feed, I'm sure I'd have one.
By using the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little allocated, but I don't give it any more turns.
It's a genius of product," a woman told us.
Another person told us: "It's a funny announcement to mothers who use a breast-feeding bomb (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
In the announcement neither praise nor judgment of the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take out milk with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is quietly coupled within the breast-feeding unit, which makes its users move, hold their babies and even go out to the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, a partner and Mother's ECD, tells us: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative launch.
By showing parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, what we wanted was to draw attention to the use of lactating bombs and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and close manner the incredible sense of freedom that the new bomb offers.
This is not the first time Elvie bomb appears on the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded through the walkway for the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of minors displaced discreetly to a camp at the Texas border
The number of minors detained has seen a significant increase, despite the fact that the monthly influx to the border has been almost at the usual levels, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration, which are making it difficult to equip these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that the fact of proposing to accommodate a child would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential fathers and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high office of the Immigration and Customs Office, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the sponsors or their families are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
In their efforts to prosecute minors more quickly, staff members have introduced new rules requiring that some of them be brought before the court within a period of up to one month from detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers of the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by video conferencing, instead of in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who do not consider themselves fit for protection will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers of the reception centres and the reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the greater the likelihood of anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent seizures or escape attempts.
According to the defenders, these concerns increase even further in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of discomfort in these children are overlooked.
In addition, moving to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say good - bye to their friends could lead to trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "forces of occupation" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism and that the theme "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces of Syria opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 ground soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that adequate conditions were given for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "seeming irrational fears" that would make refugees decide to stay outside the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone on the last major rebel bastion of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had "clear squares" and expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including the combatants of the Nusra Front (connected to Al-Qaeda), who will "be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy from the UN, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Command
According to this logic, Trump would win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, a dismissal or scandal would precipitate his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the peak hourly indexes have doubled to $1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has exceeded cable channel indexes with 3.5 million spectators for major night news programs.
"It's a strange attraction that we still can't understand," says Neal Baer, author-producer of "Designed Survival", a dramatic series of ABC on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip you did in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
Why? She asked him.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families might meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that can only allow the most privileged spectators.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you've been watching a panel of experts discussing the use of the sources of "deep background" that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather hunter ("an unmeasured pride garment", in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s scaffolding descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's in part what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", when he talks to us about the alternate distribution of Trump's show and his daily shifts from the plot (either entering into a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was on a sunny 27-degree day on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was sheltered inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not take off the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when in those days we were doing all those crazy programs and people told us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

Foreign money flows into the best-adjusted Mid-term Elections of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the flow of money is reaching the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a Congress district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburg, whose recently redesigned structure, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that is largely overlapped with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated for Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a financial dispute for the campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for the Congress District 18 in Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support to China, although after casting back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a pleasant meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization management team.
The officials of the State Department decided to return the heads of the US diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "new decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department spokesman, in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, who had already received aid from some 140 million US dollars 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cutbacks to financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence plans to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, if the diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment by Washington.
A spokesperson for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal deliberations under anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke under anonymity.
The Study of History
The next planned step could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of Trump's justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public registry.
Mueller is also thought to be investigating the possibility that Trump's campaign will work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that camera, just as he prepares to re-appear before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and with this I do not suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the dispute.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to strike Hitler. It was only necessary that the West had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of butchery that followed.
The course of history revolves around these inflection points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Chief General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in good shape since this newspaper reported that last year it had suggested secret recording to the president and speculated about his inability to charge.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his office in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will meet with a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech-lovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that I once occupied my ambassador’s house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic at the meeting against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify in the G Group of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented medium camper Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season up to the 2 to 2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a trampoline for bigger things.
"We were able to make a good point, since the Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the party by believing that we could get something and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have won the victory at the end, but overall the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for all and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult party because they have already achieved a good result in the previous party, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now we see a general atmosphere that everything will go well.
The team is fine, the boys are enjoying themselves very much and we are having good training.
I have the hope that we will be able to move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success."
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose their sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talk about this to their relatives.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking the steps to have this conversation," tells Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Include in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or to ensure yourself with your own savings, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: move forward to legal battles.
Get a medical care power to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with their own wishes in case they cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a notary power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on his behalf and ensure that his bills are paid if he is disabled.
Don't forget the little details: imagine that your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan to always be ready.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake: what do doctors have to deal with?" asked Martin.
"What are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
We must have everything planned."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
With the communications blocked, assistance officials have not been able to obtain any information from the Domanga Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Dongaga, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dojaga is a reign that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Domanga.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongagala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Domanga.
A tsunami also hit the west of Domanga in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffer from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries on 26 December and took the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatal victims on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that affected the south coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's reign in Aceh, causing destruction and panic by recalling the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunamis, but the collapse of buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large earthquakes that caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29 years old and citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by the state police in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a well-known woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she took her phone away.
Palin has been sentenced to custody at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held with an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He presented himself to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "definitely innocent" when his statement was requested, the chain reported.
Palin is facing three minor Class A crimes, which means that he could spend up to one year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a minor offence of Class B, with one day ' s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of interfering in the complaint of a domestic violence crime and of having a weapon in a state of drunkenness, in connection with the incident.
Her girlfriend had said she punched her in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her child's violent behavior with the post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of fatal victims
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude earthquake of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and are expected to increase the number of deaths in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, which is located to the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social networks and show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a playful festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane last October on the Lower Manhattan West Side Highway, bringing down the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intendedly" and caused "intendedly" serious bodily injuries, in accordance with the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty, filed in the South New York District.
The two charges involve a possible death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 charges involving eight organized crime murder charges, which often use federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to prosecutors, which described the way Saipov did it as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", is specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the South District of New York was prosecuting a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be removed in his hospital room, the police said.
He has been found not guilty of the indictment of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a sentence of guilt with life imprisonment without possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov ' s defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Mr Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's deputies suggested that he should handle negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in the Birmingham concentration that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" if Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May to reconcile his divided ranks has further highlighted when a group of Tories in favor of permanence have joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up the plan of the commitment signed in Chequers in the midst of the attacks on Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Mr Bone said in Leave Means Leave's concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have gone out already," he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be helpful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and we want to remain in the European Union is completely false."
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the concentration, where she told reporters: "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favour and is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually going out on the streets and voting in the first place.
Forget Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: The prime ministers keep their positions when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the concentrates that they should make politicians "feel hot" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them out with theirs."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are going to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory with the Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the permanence traveled the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists waved banners from Tories Against Brexit after presentation of the group this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus, for the border in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she "will consider all the possibilities of presenting herself for the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a common critic of President Donald Trump, will be presented for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
Much has been speculated about the possibility that Warren would face Trump by 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he was planning on presenting himself for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes there being a woman at the highest."
A man arrested for murder with the LSU Sims player's firearm
Baton Rouge (Luisiana) police announced this Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for killing Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man that is seen in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was shot near the campus of Southern University at the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a headshot wound that finally caused his death," said Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and got a shot at Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a player from Baton Rouge 1,98 meters high, played in 32 games last season, holding 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the orders of the team will give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas was classified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton out of his mind by defending his position on the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into boxing and let Hamilton run into the group queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went out hard later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after an action with the wheels almost caught that made the Ferrari driver have to let the interior hardly get free at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, began from the last row of the grill and was placed in the seventh square at the end of the first round.
Then he led a large part of the race while holding on to his tires to achieve a quick finish and overcome Kimi Raikkonen for fourth position.
Finally, he went into boxes on the round 44, but could not increase his pace on the remaining eight laps by recovering Raikkonen fourth position.
It's been a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman letting me through.
The team has done exceptional work to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday because of his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, who was nominated for the Supreme Court.
Speaking in a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are "sick, repugnant and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false," he said.
"When you read the publications and the filtrations, and then they say "But if I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't filter it," she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied the filtration from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter her story," Feinstein told the committee, as The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep him confidential and, therefore, I did so."
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who during the Saturday night rally commented: "I'll tell you one thing: that was a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defence to the appointment of the Supreme Court, which had been accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and repugnantness, they don't care who does harm, who they have to run for power and control," said the president as Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday in Elite League before Belfast Giants by winning the game back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial advantage of two goals thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local draw before Dwyer restored the Giant leadership.
Francois Bouchard set up for the Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed their victory.
This has been the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won the Dundee by 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford provided assistance to double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan again put the local team in the mood to play at minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the game at minute 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first part.
The local team was regrouped and Bouchard again matched the match with a gorge in minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time in the party at the end of the second party and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as the final approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home before Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died after making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large - scale earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to hit the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
Even though his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Général refused to leave his post in the control tower of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu. This tower was being hit by a strong swing.
He remained firm to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the track at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian channel ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency states that access to the cities of Dogalga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and many people could not be contacted," says Sutope Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help survivors as much as possible, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse."
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit early this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the air accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated healthy and saved the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that a male passenger could not be noticed from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's something extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers were able to advance through a water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that began to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who were working near a dock improvement also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) under the water.
Aviation security network data indicate that 111 people have died in air carrier accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presented the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor ended the presentation of his arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to chain up the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "minding, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies were that Telllis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they were only known a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence has scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held by the jury that very day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill your music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed of Bristol states that hip hop has been removed from its origins from political messages and from dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Interpreters such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York girl asks a couple to say goodbye after a "racist" text
A New York girl is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she's wrongly received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the demand with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his dismay at discovering that the new child caretaker, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her leg-method, a "strengthening" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Maurice saying that her former Afro-American babysitter had done a very bad job and instead waited for a Filipina, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for one day's work and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now demanding the couple for a dismissal compensation with the intention of receiving a compensation of $350 a day for the position of six months of internal work for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show you that things don't happen like this," he told The Post on Friday and added, "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the claims that they were racist saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was more reasonable, since they feared that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife had sent him something I didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even though it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the demand as a "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months before and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to go after someone like that?
That's not that it's a very decent thing," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
The Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put herself in the place of someone who read it for the first time before her publication.
It's very nice to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before inspired himself in a toy bear to write the book for children, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of publishing the books was something "agrid" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to pretend," he said.
"But as Paddington had been as real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who accomplishes something important: you are proud of him, even if it's not really your credit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye on the phone.
When he landed, his daughter was moved urgently to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save his life.
"Nad regularly called to say that the situation was really bad, that it was not expected to succeed," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"After I received Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep pumping his heart slowly ran out and left his system.
She had died before time and everything was going out.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I could not scream, cry, or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, outside of the terrible experience she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I shook my head and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her."
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile lit up any place."
However, he left work before he died, since he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly concerned that it can have an impact."
Davis created the cards "so people know there are people you can go to and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't feel silent, you have to talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or anything like that," he tells us.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
The Christmas Day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to overcome it: "Leave a void in the whole family.
He's left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread at the time the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a limited research in time, of limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that I was afraid the committee would be "getting to pick" in the midst of a party paralysis.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its refusal is entirely due to chronology.
Only five weeks left for the mid-term elections on 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans have bad results, their attempts to achieve the choice of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of North Korean deserters "fall" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Southern Ministry of Unification, said that last year there were 1,127 desertions, compared to 2,706 2011.
Park said the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high rates charged by human traffickers have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on this matter.
The vast majority of Northern deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have greatly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which generally agreed to work on a Korean nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for lack of progress.
"Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will in no way be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House of Representatives minority, said that the appointed Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "historical" and was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin (Texas).
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she's a hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave on Thursday to the Senate's Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny the allegations that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost screaming and choking while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the charges against them "grotesque defamations and clearly coordinated" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that, in his view, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that this could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Therefore, he objected when asked whether he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and that Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, it won't be able not only to be in the Supreme Court, it won't even be in the court you're in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Circuit Appeals Tribunal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible judgments against the Law on Accessible Health Care or the Roe Case against Wade, since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether it would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to think it's all right," Pelosi said.
And women have to take him.
It's a justifiable diabria, it's months and years of rage overflowing, and she can't let it go without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, do I?"
He continued to talk: "A woman who was executive in some company helped me a lot and told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then he kept what he was doing.
I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because basically they are not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first works, in an office dominated by men, was once that I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cockroach and dragged me to a stairway.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad because they think they've locked you up."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business, which had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, was found that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would appear for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-premeditated decision," he said to me in laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the seven dwarfs."
As the campaign was already very advanced, it stayed behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would never enter the race again unless it had raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000, they only gave her $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he gave his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thank you to the people who supported him, frustration at a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on the capture of voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism), which he caught.
"The logic would have been to think that he had had a nervous crisis," Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you gonna put on my gravestone?
"He cried?"
Trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still much left to finish the battle, a break between countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warning early in the year by placing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150,000 million) in products, which carries taxes to half of the products entering the United States from China.
Beijing has, on every occasion, taken equivalent reprisals, recently applying five to ten percent tariffs to US products worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing US attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will soon weaken.
Getting Washington back would mean yielding to demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the United States trade war could positively help China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make it possible for it to begin an economic downturn in either of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than the viewers have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asia issues for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria states that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been fought for more than seven years.
In a previous speech by the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country were improving.
"The situation on the ground is today more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All the conditions for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to abandon it have already been laid down because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people who still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem recognized that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted insurgency.
Europe is done with the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now carried six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points necessary to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, launched his point of departure to the water in pit 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth fell defeated by 5 and 4 before the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
Player number one in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 before Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already carries eight Ryder Cups, became the European with more tournament victories of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I can't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing me.
I'm very, very happy I could have recovered the cup.
It's an achievement of the whole team and I'm so glad I could help," said an excited Garcia after the European team's victory.
Now he passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the legend of the American Gulf Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in an individual game.
"I feel an incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, as I grew up seeing this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, just staying behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf game throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we're losing him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
You're a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Committee of the Ryder Cup, and move on.
I love these 12 guys a lot and I'm proud to be your captain.
Now it's up to us to lean our head.
We've been overcome."
