Learning about foreign culture is fun.
When did you start wearing a lens?
Tom wouldn't like that answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to contact us earlier.
Without fear, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnic and minority religions.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too blunt until it can't be used to cut meat, I finally use my pocket knife.
Behind his eyes is blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's forgotten.
Where have you been?
The traffic lights are used to arrange traffic.
Don't let Tom see these pictures.
This room got a little sunlight.
He's painting a picture.
I shouldn't have breached that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I'm used to not being in the mood.
It smells so bad.
Words are sentences.
There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger.
Just yesterday I found out.
You can buy it at the bookstore.
Let's ride the Intercity-Express train.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brother likes music.
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
You want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come this afternoon.
"It's no use waiting for two hours." "Yes! This mark will keep me for the rest of my life."
Tom was one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ant.
You'll never be able to find a way home, through a narrow rock road.
Tom really wasn't home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
That guy's driving a car.
Give me a birthday card that's coming soon.
Please read it again.
When can you?
I'm just kidding.
Tom almost got hit.
I'm going, too.
Love is never wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The cost has already included payment for professional services to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn logo, do you?
Tom tried to persuade Mary to help him.
Two things are unrelated.
How could I not realize this?
What's this called?
I'm still home because it's raining.
That's the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
For me, there was no fundamental difference between the cultures of these two countries.
She's cheating.
Wake me up at eight o'clock.
Tell me why he's not here.
That might affect their decision.
The rain lasted all night long.
Tom's starting to be jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that awful?
I'll buy you this bag.
It's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the deep water.
Have you ever gone to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready.
Mary refused the invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
She's sitting around her grandkids.
The boy was asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left side of the road.
He's focused on that puzzle.
That man died a few hours ago.
You want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We found out that the front door was locked.
May I speak with Mr. Sato?
This water's not stinking.
Mr. Smith is his acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying with a plane.
I've assumed that he was lying, but it didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I can't finish reading this thick book in a week.
The choice of time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other choice.
I'm not sure what else I should do.
We've done what we can.
Any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
All of us are law-bound, but rich people sometimes have more profit.
He must have made it.
I like cats.
It's done at nine o'clock.
Tom's mentally disturbed.
Is it possible that I'm crazy?
We're facing a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone's made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to.
My mother's been gone for ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, it's just you can't drive.
May I see your coupon?
He looks serious reading.
Tom married a woman that was easier than he was.
He's a copy of his father.
He has good words to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself but finally he failed.
Do you have any light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I reincarnate, I want to be reborn as a cat.
We got a lot of rain this summer.
He made an important scientific discovery.
He's a student.
Tom's already here, but Bill's not here yet.
Laurie speaking.
They recommend it to go alone.
Tom was a good man.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom tricked Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of the students went to university to continue their education.
Tom put his pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom turned it down so no one could hear it.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he long-haired?
She greets him every morning, when he enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
The fall was steeper, better off the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
His mother was worried about his son.
What operation is being shown at Lincoln Center right now?
I'm tired.
Tom killed Mary.
The data is often inaccurate.
Get up!
We've ordered the six-hundred-and-twenty.
We named the dog Tim.
He opened that letter fast.
Where's the train station?
Tom ordered Mary to follow him.
It's eleven o'clock.
I'm smarter than they are.
It's getting darker.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows him admires him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those guys are crazy!
