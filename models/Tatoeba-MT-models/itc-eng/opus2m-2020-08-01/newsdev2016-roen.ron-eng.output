The former head of the Brazilian presidential office is brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential office for alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme on the Petrobras state oil company.
The federal prosecutor's office said Jose Dirceu will be sued for the charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Other fourteen people will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, former treasurer of the Workers' Party, in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, former president of Petrobras business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the Labour Party in government taken into custody for the links with this scheme.
Dirceu served as head of office of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August from home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting scheme in Congress more than 10 years ago.
The prosecutors said that Dirceu developed the Mitting Scheme from Petrobras, accepted bribes while he was in office and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the scandal of the votes bought.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved about $2 billion in the form of bribes and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also include bribes to Petrobras directors in exchange for inflated contracts.
The "miraculous" recovery of a student survivor of the Peshawar massacre
A teen paralyzed after being shot four times in the worst terrorist attack in Pakistan succeeded in a "miraculous" recovery after treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, the Pakistani doctors had told him that he would never be able to go again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked Peshawar's public school in December last year.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be discharged later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, in the usual morning of Tuesday, Mohamed stood at first aid hour and listened carefully to his teachers.
Right then, seven armed men dressed in the uniforms of security officers entered the army public school.
They wore belts with explosives and had a simple mission to carry out: to kill all men, women and children on their way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," says Mohamed with a rough look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... then I heard gunshots outside.
The terrorists went inside and started killing. Our professor was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he pulled four students out of the amphitheater while the carnage was taking place.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, yelling at him.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he in the head.
Most of the people who killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he passed out and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the waist down.
The doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then the doctors in Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go again.
"When I saw him, I felt how my soul came out," says Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest in my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionate about cricket will never again be able to use his legs.
They campaigned and asked for help from Pakistani television, attracting support from famous people like Imran Khan, a crisis player becoming a politician.
In the end, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and offer him treatment at the Harley Street private clinic in London.
The consultant neurosurgeon Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "fearful" when he arrived at the hospital.
"He had spent the last [a few months] lying in bed, without being able to move on the other side," says Malik.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
It wasn't in a very good shape.
A vertebrae at the base of Mohamed's spine had been destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in his shoulder, hip and back during the attack, and his lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
But during an operation that lasted six hours, Malik and his team managed to re-read the nerve endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just one week after the operation, Mohamed got up and started taking steps and going.
We weren't expecting such a good outcome.
It was a miracle," he says.
Within two weeks of the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged fate and began to go again
He wants to become strong and to continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But he is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel like I still have a chance to live" he says, showing pictures of weapons drawn by him next to school textbooks and pens
Physically, Mohamed gets stronger every day, but psychological trauma through which he passes and now is unimaginable.
"My light has not fallen," he confesses.
In my school there were little kids killed.
What murder did they commit?
His mother wipes out a tear, comforts him and says: “I see my son walking again. ”
He'll be able to continue his life.
The 4G "Super Voice" service from Three offers better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
Three mobile phone provider has launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve reception within buildings and in rural areas without signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
And other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over-Term Evolution (Volte)".
It only works for the moment with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the months ahead.
Three mentions that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to the service by 2017.
Head of Technology, Bryn Jones said: “By the end of the year, a million of our clients will have access to better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than so far.”
The views are prepared for the pantomime train
The pantomime station is very important for theaters throughout the United Kingdom, many of them preparing now for this year's internship.
Now, at the Christmas theater, some of the biggest names in showbusiness are participating.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Cinderella - first in the role of one of the evil sisters, and second in the role of the fairies.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty"
Steven Wilson was recently appointed as the great winner of Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has often been called the most laborious musician in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent won three prizes at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In its five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a clever, expressive and captivating art opera".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of several music projects, the most famous of which is the rock band Porcupine Tree.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at the Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activity.
He told BBC about his love for vinyl and his loaded program and explained how comedy actor Matt Berry got to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up right in the time of the end of the vinyl era and I remember that at that time I was just waiting for the CD to appear, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You were buying a record, going home with him, having a scratch and you had to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example the classic one, they're better than wines.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing more to really appreciate.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice painting hanging in the living room.
There's something you can hold in your hand while you get absorbed by lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but there's no way it could be if kids too young to remember wine like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl you especially hold on to?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyl in the '90s.
All the wines I've bought are bought again.
I started from the idea of rebuilding the collection that I was 15 years old, but I'm past that limit.
The first record I convinced my parents to buy was Out of the Blue from Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately, it's somewhere in a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a door to potential new fans
Why did you launch your new Transition compilation on vinyl?
This was originally conceived as an idea for record shop day, but we missed the opportunity.
My record house had suggested collecting some of my shortest and most accessible songs.
I have become easily obsessed with the idea of doing something like "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I have always kept the project just to be launched on vinyl.
Whoever buys the vinyl also receives a download version at high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in her real light?
No, because, although I concentrate on longer music, there's one thing I've always valued above anything: the song part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses more on technical complexity than on the song side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, has passed the time test because they have always put the emphasis on the song and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for Albert Hall shows?
I don't want to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different in each of the nights.
In the first, it will be a version of the Hand show. Erase. that we had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night will be rather an incursion into my history, being more oriented towards the fans who followed me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show the second night?
And the rest of the tour team are big fans of [the comedy show on Channel 4] Toast of London, to the point where we always give it quoted.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music too, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
We talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him in the opening.
You remixed albums of bands like XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does that affect your own music?
I'm not consciously inspired by this, but, inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they keep you in mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was undoubtedly the most progressive old school album I've ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all year before.
The current album, Hand Erase, is much more open, because I was working at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the most busy rock rock musician progressive.
Is that how you feel?
You can delete the word progressively.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I'm not saying that proudly, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an incredibly strong work ethic.
If I don't do anything a whole day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why remix work was a gift, because it means I don't have to do all the time just my music.
The music industry is a tough place to make your career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy I don't think I would have survived.
Transience will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will play at the Royal Albert Hall on September 28 and 29, as part of his 2015-2016 European tournament.
A new contract brings back jobs to Skytrans
The new Skytrans re-employed some of the airline staff who had lost their job when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, the restored company in northern Queensland, has signed a $25 million contract to transport the employees of the natural gas company QGC, meaning that 18 crew members have recovered their job.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidized routes that formed a large part of the airline business.
The bankruptcy caused several communities to face a potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, a national-liberal federal parliament for Northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the critics of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, CEO of Skytrans, said that the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We were able to re-engage 18 Skytrans staff members with full standards, as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC customers.
In just five months, we've grown up with 100% work force, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims to extend Skytrans's flight operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which serves the Head of York and the Torres Strait, and also to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 returns weekly flights for QGC staff and Brisbane entrepreneurs to Chinchilla and Taroom locations in its 36-seat Dash-8 planes, starting on Monday, October 26.
Tony Nonan, Executive Director of the CGC, said Skytrans received the contract following an auction procedure.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a Queensland company," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains its high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal Parliamentary and New Mother Kelly O'Dwyer is advised to make a larger milk reserve to avoid losing votes in the Chamber
Looks like more women will be part of the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be covering Mondays and there are strong signs that more women will occupy portfolios.
One of the government's risers, Kelly O'Dwyer, has been advised to make a greater supply of milk for her newborn to avoid breast-feeding to intervene in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government's disciplinary officer, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his Labour counterpart to find out what the most appropriate approach for a nursing Parliamentary, in accordance with the existing orders.
Liberal Parliamentary Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter Olivia.
Under the existing orders - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - breast-feeding mothers get a vote in Parliament.
That means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exemption before he consulted the opposition's disciplinary officer, Chris Hayes, on this issue.
Things rushed on two occasions when O'Dwyer could not attend a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to hold a speech because he had just begun breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked whether the parliament was planning to make a larger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, Parliamentary of Queensland, is responsible for government discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
They both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but sources separated from Buchholz and O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins division was furious when he was told to make a larger reserve of milk instead of breast-feeding his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This fact is revealed even when the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull works at the establishment of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, Liberal National Parliamentary of Queensland, was promoted as responsible for the discipline of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the censoring motion test of February of this year.
O'Dwyer, in the image of Amanda Rishworth of the Labour Party and her son Percy, is one of the three mothers in Parliament.
Former Head of Discipline, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a motion of censure by which he wanted to be removed from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolik, liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed deputy head of discipline.
Nickolik had recently kept the newspaper's front page, after it was discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to refuse to challenge Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after the birth of her daughter, Olivia, in May.
It is one of the three parliamentarians who became mothers this year.
The spokesman for the Labour Party, Catherine King, said Wednesday that voting power for breast-feeding mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"She is now [seven years old]," she wrote on Twitter.
The disciplinary officer should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said Wednesday she wants more women in her cabinet.
"No one wants more than me to see more women in power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, throughout the country," said the Prime Minister in front of reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included only one woman in his first cabinet and, after pressure to increase the representation of women in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the renewal of December.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, a publisher at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull could have on Australia's business sector.
On Tuesday, lobby groups in the business sector did not know how to manifest their enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbul took over the country's friars as prime minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see had been abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or had just arrived in a negotiated suspension due to Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke together about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy the public interest, to reach a political agreement and to do things right.
So what exactly does the country's biggest companies and their representatives expect from our new Prime Minister?
CHAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising.
Turnbull itself has set the free trade agreement with China as its starting point.
In his first speech in which he announced on average that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChAFTA) was the central point of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticized “the revolting outbreaks of economic suicide” by the Labour Party regarding that problem and expressed concern about the racist temptation of critics.
"In the context of CHAFTA, winners are numerically much more than losers," he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes he will win this debate.
Don Argus, a legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising and negotiate with the entire senate.
Minister for Small Business, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could lead from the beginning to certain differences with the business environment.
The impact assessment applies to large mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer due to lack of competition.
It is called "Evaluation of Effects" because it takes into account not only the company's actions and intentions but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this assessment is drawn up is extremely important for the outcome.
The Harper Analysis of Competition Law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to get out of the market for smaller operators.
The government led by Tony Abbott was by the Australian Business Council and major retailers.
Turnbull now understands that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he'll do next.
The CAA has burned to say that if Turnbull follows Harper's recommendations, consumers will need to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one who advised the new Prime Minister to have greater respect for the processes in the cabinet, which Turnbull seems to also make it by leaving Bruce Billson, the minister for small businesses (which is on the side of Harper recommendations) to support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers followed women between sixty and eighty years of age.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have reduced their "significant" probability of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the table of multiplication under the question
Terrence Howard is of the opinion that I completely misunderstood arithmetic.
The negative character in the Empire told Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think one time he's equal to one.
"How to be equal to one?" he said.
If one time you do one, it means two doesn't have value, because one time it doesn't work itself.
One time I do two, because the square root of his four is two - so what is square root of his two?
It should be one, but we're told it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's teachers disagreed with his theory, so he gave up the Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"I mean you can't close your eyes when you know something is wrong," he explained.
Howard found his parallel approach to mathematics called "Terryology".
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassessing scissors, wires, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his theory "one time one" and other similar theories of his.
He told the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, were spending up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The editor Rolling Stone described Howard's creations as "the most complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional walls that are connected to each other with copper wire or magnetized.
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the American patent 20150079872 A1 (‘Systems and methods for improved construction bricks’).
Also, the actor in the "Following the footsteps of an idol" also says Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would "crazy" if they saw Terryology.
"You know," he says, "I've been asking myself since I was three-four years old why does a bubble take round shape?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard also added that he hopes to change the whole course of education.
"This will be the last century our children will learn that one time they will make one," he said.
They won't have to grow in ignorance.
In twenty years now, they'll know that one time one makes two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
The real universal math.
We'll check in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Printing
Tuesday, during the show "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang little at Fallon's Wheel of Printing, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying her vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also performed versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Weeknd.
This week, Grande's name is still in the press.
On the same day she had also been at Good Morning America, where she opened the show with the gogoashe linex.
Taco Bell hopes that the Cantina restaurants where they will be served will become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On 22 September, the Mexican-style fast food chain will open a new location in the Chicago Wicker Park area, offering a menu of appetizer tapas, a fresco painted by a local artist and even alcoholic beverages.
It is the first test location of the “Taco Bell Cantina” restaurants of the chain, which addresses young people, concentrated more and more in the city centers.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6000 restaurants in the USA, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap food, prepared quickly, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average Taco Bell payment rating of 7 USD, the company used drive-through services and quick services to attract the number of customers needed to make profit.
But Taco Bell says that, in order to address the new generation that “looks for more central urban environments to live, work and have fun,” test locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
So you can do a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine what it means to buy a rough land in an area like Wicker Park?
"Don't let yourself," said USA toDAY Neil Borkan, Frenchman Taco Bell who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location in Chicago, the new menu will be prepared alongside traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you can see the food yourself" before being prepared," said Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Also, wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will be served at the new location, following the recent example of many Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer "nightly" menus that include beer, wine and snacks.
A thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company said that another Taco Bell Cantina location will open in San Francisco near AT&T Park this month, replacing drive-through service and parking with an inside court and a sales window.
These location changes, atmosphere and attachments indicate that the fast food chain of restaurants also wants to attract other types of customers outside those who are looking for fast food late at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when he opened more expensive Cantina and burritos menus, to compete with Chipotle, the project being supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If they succeed, Cantina restaurants will be another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said that by 2022, he intended to open 2000 restaurants in the United States.
As Sandland said for AP, “a few hundred” of these will be “Cantina”.
They incinerated the calls in the middle of the night: Elton John makes Putin's court
Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned Elton John on Monday night only a few days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to meet with the Russian politician to discuss with him the old Russian legislation.
The British song, declared homosexual, failed to get an interview with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, one year after he challenged the protests in this country and supported two concerts in 2013, during a tense period in the history of this state, following the adoption of controversial laws, which prohibit "gamous propaganda" around minors.
In 2014, in Sankt Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and spoke to the fans of the following statement: "Although I'm gay, I always felt welcome here in Russia."
If I wasn't honest about what I was, I couldn't compose these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for this, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist discovered that he wanted to meet with Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information on the telephone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos sang all over the ANRP folder
The businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a burning conviction, "chanting" in front of the judges and detailing how he distributed millions of euros to the former members of the ANRP Commission.
Yesterday at the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the case in which he is tried with the son or Alin Cocos, by the former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Compensations of ANRP, Dorin Cocos was hit by the lightning of sincerity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told the judges how he helped the businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of the ANRP's payments, instead asking to be judged faster and to take into account his collaboration.
Cocos thus showed that he had known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he was engaged with it after more real estate business.
He noted that Sergiu Diacomatou met in 2010, and he told him he was working at the ANRP.
Later we found out that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is vice president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at the ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised him the money, 2.5 million euros, the money I told him I'd give him in several trances.
I also promised him political support, to remain in office.
"Diacomatou told me then that he helped me, but he needs support," Dorin Cocos showed in the courtroom.
He also said that later, through an acquaintance, he came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Compensation Commission, who promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatou already had political support, I also gave him five million euros.
I gave Dragos Bogdan 800,000 euros.
I'm specifying that all this money was giving her in trances to make sure the file was solved.
"That's what I told them: to fix the file, to pay off," Cocos said.
Asked why he got to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I got, for the second case, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I'm only left with 1.2 million euros.
In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.
"We've never talked to this money or land," Cocos said.
He also showed that "it was notoriety that all members of the ANRP understood before the meeting."
I wasn't nervous that they wouldn't give a positive vote.
All the functions were political in the ANRP, but I personally did not help Diacomatu politics.
"I told him that I only helped him politically to calm him down," Cocos concluded his statement.
Bridge brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was at DNA yesterday for only five minutes, while he filed new documents in the "Turceni - Rovinari" folder.
Victor Ponta escaped to DNA with a document of the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the side of the file in which he is researched for false inscriptions under private signature, charged with tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went from his own initiative to DNA, although the documents he could have sent by lawyer.
It wasn't like that, since the prosecutor didn't have time, the prime minister leaving after five minutes, while he left the record several documents.
I wanted to file the European Court of Justice decision of 3 September, which explains what happens to service contracts.
I say we've been active, the prosecutor says we haven't done, the European Court of Justice has told us to see each other on both sides, because as long as the taxes are paid, it's okay.
"In the view of the European Court of Justice, which is binding, surely, for all the countries of the European Union, we do not have a case here," Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on the issue of DNA.
The bridge also said that, from a point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply, if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expects his prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call him back at hearing, but to give him an answer to his requests, including the release of the file.
Johnis is enjoying his term without a TV
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch TV.
And you don't even own such a device, since you pay your TV fee once with your energy bill.
But if you're the head of the state, things change radically.
Because it is practically understood that the position of the president of Romania is also linked to everyday realities.
President Iohannis plunged daily into a total quiet in his office or from Cotroceni
Only, to the astonishment even of his closest people from the Cotrocene Palace, Klaus Iohannis refused to have television in his presidential office.
And after he doesn't watch TV - at any program, at least at German posts RTL or Pro Sieben - the president doesn't listen to radio stations and doesn't read newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or asked for a priority.
Instead, Johnnis is happy to receive only the report of the news that puts him in a positive light.
And besides this self-insulation of information, in which the only breach is access to the facebook, much more serious is the blockage to which, through its passivity, the head of the state pushes the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although it's been so long since its installation in office, Johnnis has not yet signed the declarations of loyalty of more than half of the employees of the Presidential Administration.
Which becomes an increasingly serious problem, both humanly and legally.
Silence and peace
Those in the presidential environment are already clear that no one and nothing can ever ruin the "feng shui" of the head of state.
Where is peace and quiet.
What's right, only after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when Sibi's former building demands the presence of officials.
A custom that probably didn't get away from when he was driving the city's primary on Cibin.
And the fact that Iohannis doesn't want television in his office has already been born countless legends, being already people from the Cotrocene Palace who have come to bow to the variant that the president would try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially he doesn't have any radios.
Only at this rate will he be able to meditate as soon as in the dark, because the lighting devices can hide the audio-video recording technique.
Just fine.
Also another weirdness from the Cotrocene Palace is the delivery to the head of the state only of the "Pzoitive Monitoring" of the President's activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the head of the state will receive its content on the biorus.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that it was banned from "negative monitoring" in conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a result of the night television shows in which he was criticized, but he was asking for negative news every morning, as a matter of priority.
That doesn't mean a guest like he helped him out of something, but that's what the gesture counts!
And at least he can never have an excuse that he was not well informed of alternative sources.
Neither outside nor confirmed
Now, after all, love her and the mystery why she doesn't want to watch Klaus Iohannis on TV.
Until then, however, it would be more important to resolve, regardless of the formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees from the Presidential Administration.
Who, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the state in charge and who must bear and sign it.
Only since December and until now, Klaus Iohannis has not signed for confirmation at least half of these statements, although this was to happen within 30 days.
So hundreds of employees, representing more than half of the staff at the Cotrocene Palace, have an uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the chief of state doesn't personally sign their statement, they should be fired.
Only they didn't get the negative opinion!
So, I mean, I can come anytime by the Court of Auditors inspectors, who will find that over half a year, hundreds of people have received their salaries at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
That's until the president and the president decide whether to kick him out or confirm him on his posts, his decision being strictly his.
Authorities said that a teenager was launching an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S.
The ISIS-inspired plan of a teenager to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the United States was rather "suctional" than operational, confirmed on Tuesday a police source for Fox News.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August, when the law enforcement authorities laid off the plan.
The plan is the same as the Texas representative Mike McCaul, the Homeland Security president, during an interview given on Sunday, said a source for Fox News.
"We monitor very carefully the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States," McCaul said at "This Week" at ABC.
Pope Francis was not referred to as the specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
Common information from the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, in which it is said that the adolescent planned to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, targeting “a foreign dignitary during a high-level event”.
The bulletin mentions that the minor has radicalized through social networks.
The adolescent may suffer from a mental illness, said a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without providing accurate details about the young person's illness.
On Sunday, McCaul also recognized the potential for an attack by a so-called "single wolf" across the nation and noted that it was informed by the Secret Services about a "strictly secret location" for the Pope's visit.
And that comes with a high risk of security...But as the date approaches, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he arrives in the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
Scheleton dating from the medieval period discovered in the tree has suffered a violent death, experts say
Irish archaeologists have revealed amazing details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
Collooney's bean, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, bringing to light the macabre view of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish Service of National Monuments brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to dig and analyze the remains, thus discovering a frightening story.
"He was killed violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services for FoxNews.com.
At the top of the chest there are wounds caused by the knife. There is such a trace in the left hand, which suggests that he is trying to defend himself.
Scheleton is a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We can't know if he was killed in battle or in a personal argument," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after the Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
"Probably he was buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd said to FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents that testify that there was a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of discovery: the height of the young man.
"He had 1 meter 77," says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means quite a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about food
National Institutes for Health (NIH) have spent nearly $1.5 million studying what small children think about food.
The project, called "The way in which babies and young children perceive food" is carried out by the University of Chicago and so far has established that young people are not prepared to eat food that is smooth by other people or that they have trained others.
According to the project's funding, "adequate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritionally healthy diets."
There is evidence that the first food models of babies and young children have lasting consequences for the health of their entire lives.
The premise for this study is that there is a lack of research on the way infants are concerned about food.
“Despite the complexity and significance of food selection, psychologists for child development have been surprisingly paying little attention to the study of how babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food, said the financier.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on choice and consumption of food in infants and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have “limited knowledge in the field of food”.
Children aged between three and six years “know more about food than infants and young children”, but they are “extremely mofturous consumers”.
An actress who played "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played in the TV show "Star Trek: Voyager" was arrested in the east of Tennessee, accused of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that actress Jennifer Ann Lien, age 41, who played Kes's role in the television show, is accused of two offences of indecent exposure, involving children under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.
The officers of the sheriff's office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on 3 September, to Lien's home in Harriman, where they say they found it empty under a blanket on the couch.
The officers said that Lien refused their requests to dress up.
Harriman's chief of police, Randy Heidle, says that Lien has been brought several counts of charges, including the aggravated bodily injury after the April incident in which he says that Lien has entered a police car with his own car.
He still doesn't know if he has a lawyer.
Police identified the killed victim found in the Epping Forest
A man whose body in decay was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On September 9, Hidir Aksakal, 53, was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest in northeastern London.
The man of Turkish origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close ties to the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
The last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved he was killed, and the detectives say his body was probably several weeks in the Epping forest.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo of the Metropolitan Police said: “Mr. Aksakal was very well known locally as Boxer Cetin and we hope to find out from the Green Lanes community information to help us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a popular and crowded tourist resort, where there is a café and a boat ride lake.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
Please all those who have been in the area in the past few weeks and may have noticed some unusual or suspicious activity to come and talk to us.
Super Chief: Six Women Jongling Between Maternity and Service
Unlike any other country in the world, except Papua New Guinea, in the United States there is no centralized policy on maternity leave paid.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo's executive director Marissa Mayer announced that she was pregnant with twins, but she was going to take a very short maternity leave and "work during" her spare time, the 40-year-old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture that awaits the superwoman or nothing.
But can Mayer, herself a symbol of the top woman, be to blame for unrealistic expectations?
How do other women leaders manage?
Seema Patel, an attorney and deputy director of the San Francisco Office for the Application of Labour Standards, just got a job in the government in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss surprised her with unexpected advice.
"I know nothing about you," said her boss.
But if you're going to make a family in the future, get on with your vacation now.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't even get a maternity leave day paid as part of her employment contract.
By then, Patel was married and very focused on her career, and the family was the last thing she was thinking about.
But he listened to her boss's advice.
She avoided using her days of medical leave for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child, two years ago, she had closed three months off paid.
Six months ago, when he was born the second child, Patel could no longer implement the same strategy.
The four months of leave he took and were entirely unpaid.
Patel says he felt no rejection from her colleagues, but has a problem with the structure of work.
“I find it very discouraging for anyone trying to have a family, ” she says.
Send a message: Your country puts no value on becoming a parent.
Karen Choi, vice president of the Capital Group asset management firm, says that any female employee who is and mother must be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggling between mother quality and job as "a constant battle".
The secret to not sinking is to have an "unbelievable family next to you" and a doll and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that you won't be the best ("not everyone can be Martha at interior fixtures") and just get through this.
Choi says he took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two and a half months for the first and ending with six months for the last.
That makes it an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child's sick, has fever, puke, and you stay up all night to care for him and you know that the next morning you have to take your other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
But her company supported her and mentioned that the performance of her investment portfolio had not suffered at all.
When she entered the finance industry, after university, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same path, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
Women who give up the job, then start again without the same chance at top-paid posts well, she says.
It is difficult to remain: “In the short term it is a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen”.
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me move on is that I want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates scientific researcher and Professor Kelly Posner, 48 years old.
The children know that their mother helps save human lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Center for the Evaluation of the Risk of Suicide at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "great objective" with regard to career and fulfill it.
It's very important for women to think they can have a vision.
Most of them don't let themselves believe this," she says.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar, when she was pregnant in eight months.
She also helped technology, she says, because she can stop the car and answer the phone after taking her children or answering an e-mail from the way.
Hungry between motherhood and a requesting career was helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. The ability to bring things to an end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, aged 33, the executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says that making maternity and career work together only through private aid networks, such as bonds, is wrong.
“You shouldn’t be lucky or winning the lottery to succeed,” she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families – mentioning very small wages, the deficit health system and the lack of a paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't take care of each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who were just born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following law school courses, was born to her child while she was a scholarshipr.
With a husband and a child based on medical care offered by the scholarship, the work leader was able to take a maternity leave for only two weeks, and then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashion designer and mother of two children, says that fewer women will leave their profession if they receive more social support, in the form of day-to-day care services from companies, maintaining the agreed programmes and accepting that effective work does not mean staying over the programme.
At the head of logistical constraints, says Mosko, there is additional pressure to activate in a field where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of tastelessness ("mummy coat" is one of the most serious insults).
“ Imagination is part of our job, either up or down," she explains.
Mosko's "permanent negotiation" in order for her multiple roles to work harmoniously means maintaining her appearance and a beautiful hand bag, from which, however, sometimes a toy-two falls.
If he remembers that men are fathers, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York Housing Authority, which deals with homes of over 400,000 New Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that maternity and career does not mean talking about "balance".
The notion of balance is a little inappropriate.
It looks more like a swinger," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom is only three months old, she just took a seven-week maternity leave after she was born this year.
"It was a very important time for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take her paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which meant leaving early or late, so that she could breast-feed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 (' cheaper than therapy') still breast-feeding.
At work, he tried to create a "friendly environment for parents" in which a child's delay is allowed, and the response to e-mails should not necessarily be sent from the office.
"The concept and the concept of family have changed and is changing a lot," Olatoye says.
"The family is very different from what had been 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to adapt.
Russian humorous say they tricked Elton John about a phone call from Putin
For cynics it seemed too nice to be true: a telephone from Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, to Sir Elton John, singer and activist for the rights of the sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it wasn't true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram where the Russian leader thanked him for addressing him about the problem, it immediately became clear that, whoever would call him on Monday night, certainly wasn't Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that he did not know about that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humorous admitted that they, not the president, had been the foreign voices from the other end of the call.
"We thought it was unlikely that Putin would want to meet him or call him, or at least not soon," said Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov, became President's spokesman, Mr. Peskov.
“But it seems that Elton John was really waiting for this phone, so he immediately thought that it was really a conversation with the people we were giving us,” he said for Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said: "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation were the most wonderful and delightful of my life.
In order to complete John’s awkward situation, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not give statements on the speculations of farce.
On the basis of the story are the comments that the singer made on the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his "ridicial" attitude towards homosexuals while militating for LGBT rights in Kiev, especially a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "proganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
“I would like to meet [Putin], talk to him,” John said to BBC, saying that although the idea was “probably unrealistic”, it was still worth a try.
Then, Monday evening, the singer sparked the mistrust of observers when he published a message on a social network, claiming that Putin answered his critics by taking his phone and calling him.
He said that “he was looking forward to meeting [the president] in front of him to discuss LGBT equality in Russia”.
Unfortunately for John, Not Putin was the one at the end of the other line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for phone calls given to many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks English well, played Peskov's role and pretended to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told journalists on Tuesday that Putin would “be prepared to meet Elton John and answer all his questions,” but at Kremlin there was no such request from the singer.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, "especially because it is not entirely written in a correct English."
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written such grammatical mistakes.
Even before the Russian duet declared its public farce, local media channels already suspected John was the victim of a joke.
Some users in the online environment had identified Krasnov as guilty, known for the phrases made to politicians with phones they record and post them on his YouTube channel like Vovan222.
Phone calls to the public, then publishing records have become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many as the initiator of gender, has developed his talent for making them farces to Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television imitating Anton Geraschenko, the direct counsellor of the Interior Minister, Arsen Avakov.
So well did Geraschenko that last year he spoke to former Governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoiski, more than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections that led to massive street protests after mass fraud reports.
Born Arkadi Dvorkovich, then councillor of the then President Dmitri Medvedev, convinced the chairman of the electoral commission, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to many Russian celebrities, his victims included former president USSR President Mihail Gorbachev, mayor of Kiev and box champion Vitali Klitschko and Russian sports minister Vitali Mutko, whom he tricked to apologize for his athletes' drunken behavior.
Last year, Krasnov would have called the Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukașenko, giving himself the son of the Ukrainian leader resigned, Viktor Yanukokovici.
It was so convincing, that the person at the end of the other, whose voice resembled Lukașenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to talk to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
Legislator Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the Propaganda Law, told The Guardian that John should not disturb Putin with such an "irrelevant subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain Russia's position.
The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online poll for readers, in which 39% of respondents felt that Putin and John should meet, and 22% considered that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, over 3 million people die prematurely each year due to air pollution from outside, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal burned for heating houses and cooking, but research reveals that a similar alarming reason is agricultural emissions from Europe and the United States, where it is the main reason for these deaths.
The report warns that if no action is taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projections should draw an alarm signal for public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, environmental health expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air rain are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
They cause stroke and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million deaths annually, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
Research has not included the effects of indoor air pollution, e.g. from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause 3.4 million more deaths per year.
The new study, published in Nature newspaper, is the first to highlight various sources of outdoor air pollution and estimated the number of premature deaths they cause, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on different populations, including new information on how pollution affects Chinese and Indian inhabitants.
One third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-extinguishing fuels, such as wood and coal, for heating houses or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognised dangers.
The consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of India’s 645 000 annual deaths and one third of China’s 1.4 million annual deaths.
However, the research found that agricultural ammonia emissions had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld from the German Chemical Max Planck Institute, which led the research.
A fifth of deaths at global level are caused by these emissions, which mainly come from cattle, birds and pigs and from the excess use of fertilizers.
The ammonia reacts with exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces tiny particles, being the main reason of death due to air pollution in the east of the United States, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing a fifth of deaths, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
This has caused only 5% of deaths globally, but the figure could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by the plant, in particular by those operating with coal, was significant globally, causing one of seven deaths.
In the United States, it is the main single factor, causing one third of the 55,000 deaths annually, compared with 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid regions and with much dust, has caused nearly a fifth of the deaths globally caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, responsible for 92% of deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The overlap between the high degree of pollution and the large number of residents says the word on public health, but no more is known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," says Jerrett.
The results are surprising and potentially important for overall public health protection.
Currently, all particles are assumed to be as toxic.
But if those caused by fuel burning are more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, Jerrett says "discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and because it suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both from scientists and political leaders."
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmosphere specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “The study really underlines the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in the very populated areas of Asia.”
A statement by Victor Ponta also tensiones relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Roman Prime Minister talks about attitudes that remind Nazism
The relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement of the construction of a fence at the border with Romania, after the border of the Sabbath, have experienced a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the authorities of Budapest on Monday that he treats refugees "with bat and inserted".
Hungarian Diplomatia reacted hard to talk about "extremists and liars", but not even Victor Ponta went further and accused government officials in the neighbouring country that they are "a shame" for Europe.
It should be noted that it is not for the first time that Ponta tries to tension Roman-engagement relations by declarations made at delicate times or electorally.
It all started from a statement made on Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he was trying to argue that Romania could not receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem is that you have our logistical capacity to treat those people like people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with their clothes and inserts.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu was at the forefront of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophob feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's our job to solve the problem.
"We'll treat those people like us," said Victor Ponta on Monday, quoted by the Truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the inclusion of refugees, but Chehia was recently in the center of critics after writing numbers on the hands of migrants in several trains, in a gesture that remembered the procedure used by the Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners in concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken over by magyaridok.hu, that the internal political crises that rocked Victor Ponta's position make him make statements "extremist and lying".
The Romanian businessman from Budapest was summoned to provide explanations, informs Mediafax, citing MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements about how Hungary manages the crisis of immigrants," says the Hungarian Foreign Ministry.
Levente Magyar, Secretary of State for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in Hungarian MAE, expressed "surprise" in connection with Victor Ponta's "constant attempts to save his controversial moral position through anti-ungary lies", stresses the diplomacy of Budapest.
"I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives - but read the story below and you will understand the indignation I feel, as a European citizen and man, about the mentality and attitudes Europe has seen only in the 1930s-40s!!", Ponta wrote on his Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European politicians, he has "debt" to attract attention and sanction "the constant behaviour of government officials of the highest level in Hungary" who are "a shame for European Union culture and values" by "anti-semitic attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"S weapons, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are policy makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees are fleeing!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and especially the superiority of European values", and "what we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction to these objectives and values!".
During the evening, Ponta was invited to Antenna 3, where the main subject constituted Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea named Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if Hungarian soldiers caught and shot or killed some children or women, in a speech in which he made several references to Nazism.
In the dispute, UDMR president Kelemen Humor, who considers that the Roman authorities should not have a "sentimental approach" in connection with Hungary's intention to build a fence on the border.
Leader UDMR claims that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or the Roman citizens, showing that the fence might even help our country not become an intensive route transited by migrants who want to reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to point out, I mean, that we don't have to hysterize, take this whole thing as something against Romania and don't have to use it to make any worse relationships not too good between the two governments, because that's not the case.
I think any sentimental, visceral approach isn't right.
"We have to see the rational part, see why we have come here and we have to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, the Roman citizens and it does not prevent free movement between the two states, within the EU," Kelemen Humor said.
The West ignored Russia's offer to lift Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership in 2012
Russia has proposed more than three years ago the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, according to a high official involved at that time in negotiations with closed doors between the western countries and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
Former President of Finland and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said Western powers have not benefited from the proposal ever since.
Since 2012 tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been forced to escape from the country, giving birth to the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held talks with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
He further stated that during the discussions, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churchin, offered a plan that included among others and Assad's proposal to give up power at some point after the start of the peace treaties between regime and opposition.
He proposed three things:
One--we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we need to initiate a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
"Three - we have to look for an elegant way for Assad to retire," Ahtisaari said, telling the Russian ambassador's position.
But he also said Ahtisaari, the United States, Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator would fall, that they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012," Finland's former president continued.
Russia has officially supported Bashar al-Assad firmly over four and a half years of war, insisting that his removal cannot represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow recently began sending troops, tanks and military flight equipment to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to confront the extremists of the Islamic State.
The Internet Live Programme of antenna 3 will be available against cost
Antenna 3 informed viewers on Tuesday that from 1 November the program or live will be able to be viewed online against cost, based on a monthly subscription.
In a "sword to viewers", the news post of the Intact trust says that "we do this with a narrow heart, wanting to stay with us and in this new stage, imposed by the conditions of the market".
According to the same message, the subscription will be €1 per month "for those of you who follow us online", television promising that the viewing will be at a very good quality.
Antenna 3 claims that "all these live broadcasts from the country and abroad, campaigns, daily news were and are possible through a constant financial effort, assumed, which assumed permanent re-technology and quality focus."
We managed to support ourselves, under conditions that offline and online distributors did not contribute anything to the content offered.
The announcement comes under the conditions that the news television program is accessible on the basis of subscription and on the Antenna Play online platform, where, moreover, the most often exclusive and recordings of the programs from the Antene were accessible.
Reports show that the populations of marine animals and plants have half-lifed in the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis faced by animals and marine plants is documented in a study that states that marine species across the globe, including those essential for the safety of human food, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions to the global oceanic ecosystem combine and create a cycle of difficulties for almost all marine life, says WWF's "Live Blue Planet".
Coral reefs are seriously at risk of decline (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and large grasses, which depend on many other species, have experienced a significant decline, while entire populations of commercially valued fish, such as macro and tuna, have decreased vertiginos by three quarters compared to the 1970s, the report shows.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the middle of this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to deteriorate, as a result of increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, causing direct proportional increase in the level of carbonic acid from the sea.
"Healthy seas are a source of extraordinary beauty and natural wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, Chief Marine Policy Adviser at WWF-UK, who contributed to the preparation of the report.
"By overfishing, which damage coastal habitats, and without solving the problem of global warming, we resemble the seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," said Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of published scientific literature, but also on the Indexes of the living planet, a database maintained by the London Zoo Society, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It investigated a great diversity of marine species, from fish, sea turtles and sea currants - an animal similar to a worm, with rough skin - up to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the areas of algae have decreased by about 30% in the last century, while the total number of mangrove areas has decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
During a single generation, human activity has caused enormous damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
Deep changes are needed to ensure an abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have occurred in fishing species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 people from 17 species belonging to the Scrombodae family - macro, ton and sardines - fell by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without any signs of recovery, the report says.
We are in a fishing race that could end up depriving people of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
Excess fishing, the destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, which are based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our struggle to eradicate poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, scientific director of the ZL, said: "These alarming figures prove how quickly people change plants and animals in the ocean and represent a clear warning about the problems we may face as a result."
Sea grass: deep underwater "pastions" that catch rich sediments in minerals and stabilize the seabed.
Over the last century, the coverage area has decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Almost 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many can disappear during this century if ocean acid continues to deteriorate.
Deep-sea habitats: very little is known about the deeper areas of the ocean, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the past 40 years suggests that they are also affected by global marine changes.
Steven Gerrard denies the charges of racism that would have been brought to him by his former teammate from Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography on "My Story" serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes Senegalese player saying that "he is not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague he liked "at least" in the 17 years he spent at the club.
In response, God would have responded to Gerrard on the Senegalese Groupe Futurs Medias radio station, with cited translations attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked people of colour".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any charges of racism brought about by him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who had also made himself public and before his bad opinion about Diouf, criticized the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
“I don’t want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons in Liverpool as an example of how things can go on their backs,” he writes.
"It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and that he doesn't care about Liverpool at all," he continued.
For example, the way in which he spat out a huge and boisterous phlegm in a Celtic fan in a Ufa Cup game at Parkhead in March 2003 is evidence of his contemptuous and hateful behavior.
Diouf turned out to be a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most notorious night being the one on Celtic Park.
The Senegalese foreman was questioned by the police after the episode of the spit and fined with his pay against two weeks at the club, amounting to £60,000 being donated to a humanitarian organization at Celtic's election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard said.
I felt he wasn't willing to make every effort to help Liverpool come back to the top.
Diouf, who is now playing at the Malaysian Sabah club, criticized Gerrard publicly and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard "egoist" and claimed that no one on Anfield likes the player who led the team to the victory of the Champions League in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "zealous".
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't achieve the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the status of chief, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the world of football, the biggest football experts have framed me between the first seven players at the World Championship and between the first 100 players of the century.
Many great players don't have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go to other countries, I am venerated, while Gerrard is dismissed whenever he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From hero to professional dancer: Alek Skarlatos' quick way to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Skarlatos does not only play the role of the hero in uniform.
He is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, equally discreet and modern, tell producers.
"It has many categories and we always look for the most popular of the moment," said Deana Katz, executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find himself impressed after that.
He's charming.
He's got something special.
Before he was a competitor at the famous show - but just a few weeks before - Skarlatos arrived in the international press after taking a stand in the face of great danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 on a train full of travelers from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, Skallatos, 22 years old, sentinel in the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a phone call from President Obama, a Twitter message from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although it may have anticipated some local assessments - at Sacramento on Friday, there was a parade in favor of the young man - not expected so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"Not in a million years would I have thought I would receive this offer," Skarlatos said on Saturday, in a break from the dance rehearsals with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy to me.
Even though prior to the show of Monday evening he recognized that he is "slightly excited", he acted as a professional at his first foxtrot, getting scores that brought him almost to the forefront of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best performances of the evening.
Katz and the executive manufacturer at the "DWTS" Rob Wade said they want to keep a free spot in the show for the invited competitors over the last hundred meters, such as Skallados, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends who were on vacation, who fired a gun attack on a train of 500 passengers and immediately thought of inviting one of them to the dance contest.
He searched for social networks, found family members and sent messages to Skarlatos.
When it appeared at "Good Morning America" to report the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the ABC sister program to avoid going through all media jams.
He supported his "five-minute platoon", then he waited eagerly to find out if Skarlatos would agree to participate in "DWTS".
"It was all very uncertain once, because that's so different from what he's doing," Katz said.
A little while ago the fight in Afghanistan, and now I was wondering if he's interested in dancing.
Skallados, who is on a short break from the National Guard, had not even seen a whole show until recently.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't just want to be highlighted.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in their hands: Noah Galloway, war veteran, hand and foot amputated.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite fan competitor and finalist of last season, and to ask him about his experience.
That was probably a critical point, along with Katz's unstoppable "seeking" and "insistent messages," she said.
“Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army would look and how my friends’ image would be protected,” Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Skallatos, a great lover of sport and history, had never danced before, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up the military position quite rigid.
But Katz says it is confident that it will adapt and that the spectators will react positively.
He's gonna get a lot of love from the start, because people are proud of him and what he's done.
"How can you not support him?" said Katz.
But that'll only take a few weeks.
To go on, you have to dance.
Skallatos, who is a bachelor and wants to become a cop, says that until now, he has had fun in this completely unknown environment.
The program was the hardest fight, having to travel frequently to Los Angeles between moments when it was acclaimed in the media and various premiere ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States right after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with the family.
"This took about a day and a half," he said.
Totally, I stayed at home for four days.
There is a risk in catching a person who attracts media attention, but it is not usually in the light of reflectors, executive producer Wade said.
And the show wants to make sure the competitor handles and has fun.
"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a good experience," Wade said.
"Wouldn't Alek ever say, "Aoleu, what did I get into?"
Let's keep his fists fun.
McRib of McDonald's coming back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-costs to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of the country's McDonald's franchise offers this season speciality.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib sandwiches.
"At McRib’s 2015 promotion, approximately 8000 restaurants participate," McDonald’s spokesman Lisa McComb said for The Times in an e-mail.
In the United States there are a little more than 14 300 restaurants of this fast-food.
But according to McComb, the individual owners of the franchise decide whether or not they will serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," says McComb.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they consider they want their local customers.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain his ingredients last year, with a video showing reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year at McDonald's participating restaurants.
There is also a website with locations where McRib is served (unaffiliated at McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
But a quick search on the site shows that the nearest restaurant with McRib de Los Angeles is located in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight the appetite for BBQ chicken pizza.
Keith Richards understands that he would prepare new Rolling Stones records
Keith Richards is again in the light of reflectors with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, the other members of the Rolling Stones band might join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - recently met in London and made "clear plans for recordings", as he says.
Tuesday night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series at iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the band's first LP after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the band wasn't at all inactive.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and performed in several small concerts in L.A., including performances at Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
In the last of these, they reinterpreted the classic "Sticky Fingers" in 1971.
Richards was particularly busy this year, working in the documentary “Keith Richards: Under the Influence”, scheduled to be released on September 18 on Netflix.
This year, he also released his third solo album "Crosséed Heart" in a five-year career.
Randy Lewis from The Times described Richards' new album in an earlier interview with guitarist: “As always, Richards’s harsh voice is a better instrument than distinct.”
But Richards sparks excitement in all 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, rock 'n' the roll.
In the interview, Richards says the band will most likely enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He didn't give any other details, but judging after the last concerts, the band is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through a few difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them look much simpler than they actually were.
Some child actor on television shows such as "Silver Spoons", as an adult, has reaffirmed himself in the role of an inexpressive typical in the television series "Situation of crisis" and in films such as "Heads of nightmare".
The first film he worked as director was very acidic comedy "Bad Words", in which he also played.
The film was nominated at the International Film Festival in Toronto in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film plays Nicole Kidman and Bamaman, in the role of the troubled brothers.
The film has as its subject a festival looking for American distribution.
Many reviews of the book considered it a comedy with strong emotional tent; the film reinterprets the story, putting more emphasis on its dramatic side, darker.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bamaman says he always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen the book like this," he confessed.
In the book, the subject and the themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was addressing a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The World Premier of Monday evening benefited from an introduction by the festival's programme director Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm especially with the sitcom "The Hogan Family" in the late 1980s and early 1990s, at which Bateman worked. "We did not meet too many fans "Hogan Family", Bateman said when he climbed the stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, now 46 years old, to Guild Directors at the age of 18.
The story of his new film has a family in the center named Fang.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their shows, for example by setting up a bank robbery with academies or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she's known rather for public scandals than performance, and Baxter is a novelist and journalist of magazines trying to get famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter guess it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the story of the children who want to evolve into adult life has been reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical," Bamaman says.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with parents as managers, and this film has many elements that overlap the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun one.
"It's a story that I feel related to and I understand deep down," he added, "and although I didn't try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with an untraditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she's the movie producer, who got the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, he was co-opted Lindsay-Abaire, who adapted his own piece "Treaty to Reality", where Kidman played.
Bamaman confesses that he accepted the chance to film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production "Photograph 51", did not participate in the premiere of months.
The reader of the book was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bazman's film "a clever and caustic adaptation" that "with the typ of the highly exploited type of the dysfunctional family and sometimes the mission of a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet-yellow, incisive and usually very dark."
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very rough portrait" and mentioned that Bamaman "sees visible progress and a higher maturity as film director with this structured, but never too narrow or mechanically intelligent adaptation".
After Monday's screening, when Bamaman and Walken climbed the stage for the question session, the audience ovated him long on the Walken multibit.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I couldn't believe the ease with which the film director's work among them changes, which is very difficult, and the actor's work in the scenes.
His concentration is really amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman sits on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the background, just a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and he sees himself more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor talking to Bateman the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I find it incredibly interesting to film," Bamaman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to benefit myself as an actor.
Having the privileged position of being responsible for creating the entire experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a complete thing.
Without counting that... actor wants a foreground.
During the question and answer session, Bateman testified that, after reading the script, he immediately thought about Walken for Caleb's role, but also about Carter Burwell's composer for the soundtrack.
Known primarily for the long friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell also composed the soundtrack for two other films at the Toronto festival: the animation film "Anomalysa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Gangsters of Legend", Brian Helgeland's interpretation of the English gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the soundtrack and for Todd Haynes' "Carol".
"Works with elongated tones or obtuse seem very interesting," says Bateman, giving more explanations on Tuesday.
Navigate among those shades and guide the harmonious and somewhat elegant audience from one tone to the next during the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate through the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bamaman took another bold step, both as a director, and as an actor, in a career dominated by reinventing and decision, a mix of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bamaman confessed when he finished filming at the World premiere of Monday, "Well, bad, it came out exactly as I wanted."
The festival turns out at Oscars about Boston Globe's history of pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 to the loto?
An X-LOTTO ticket worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for one month.
The unregistered ticket to the X-Lotto extraction was purchased from the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd, Saturday, August 15.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, there were 16 other winning entries across Australia, which shared the unique prize fund of the US$ 4 million X-Lotto.
SA Lotteries asks everyone who bought X-Lotto tickets from Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them out as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the extraction of X-Lotto 3555 Saturday, August 15, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
Additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, manager Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he is looking forward to getting the good news that the one who won the big prize checked his ticket to X-Lotto.
"We have tried to spread the news out of power, for a person is our winner and has no idea," she said.
Detectives from forensics search the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where was last seen the missing man Daniel Hind
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police provided two different versions of his journey from the night he was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search the house since her brother's disappearance.
"I was hoping they'd search the house, I wasn't informed they'd do it," she said.
Miss Hind also said that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have many other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Anyway, we want him at home and end the story.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new highways and repair 17,000 kilometres of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of works for the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all part of the pan-European transport corridor, is among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure increased road safety and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for trafficking in cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking in stolen cultural goods in the Middle East due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the plundering of Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was renewed to fit the new context, with emphasis on banning cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in particular the Directorate-General for the Combating of Organized Crime (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said that Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed it in the third place, after Italy and Greece, on the top of the trafficking in objects and cultural goods.
Bulgaria's Minister of Internal Affairs has also pointed out that trafficking in cultural objects and the destruction of historic sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has expanded, described as an extremely serious war crime.
He stressed that concerted and decisive measures are needed to stop the deliberate destruction of history.
Director General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, noted that films of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrate that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
Participants at the conference on Wednesday acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must join together to stop illegal trafficking in cultural goods in the war-torn country.
Aerojet Rocketdyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc said it is expected to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will soon be banned, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to make statements about the fact that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture with equal action for rocket launches to Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say that the auctioned amount is a strategic move of Aerojet to win its Blue Origin rival, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, which develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan rocket.
ULA says that the Blue Origin engine program is about two years ahead of the AR-1 engine at Aerojet, an assertion that Aerojet contradicts.
Work on new engines became a priority after US legislators approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for launch of military or spying American satellites after annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck states that Aerojet tests engine hardware equipment, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit both the Atlas 5 of ULA rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan rocket that develops the ULA and costs about $1 billion.
Aerojet claims that it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a completely new engine and rocket, as it is currently considering ULA.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet planned to start testing the engines on a large scale in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be postponed if the company does not receive enough funds from the Air Force in expected contracts at the end of the first semester of the fiscal year 2016, which begins in October.
She also says that the whole company was looking forward to seeing how Air Forces would share a funding of about 160 million USD between rival competitors.
He also says that Aerojet was planning to try other private financing options for the engine, but did not provide details.
Competition from the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the tenderers must provide a third of the funding, and the Air Force covers two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technologies), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies, have self-financed their engine creation process and say they are not necessarily looking for government funding.
The beer company AB InBev intends a merger worth 275 billion USD with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the largest brewing company in the world, addressed rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) with regard to a takeover that would form a colossus that would produce a third of the total amount of beer in the world.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately $275 billion at current prices and would combine the dominance of AB InBev' in Latin America with that of SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, and with their beer factories in Asia.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also several places in Asia and Latin America," said analyst Andrew Holland of the General Society.
AB InBev and other top beer companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weak spots in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the company on the second place of the world and the manufacturer of over 200 beers, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that he was informed of AB InBev's intention to make an offer, which must happen at the latest by 14 October, according to British laws.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its policy of reducing costs on marketing reckoning, previously orchestrated the acquisition of Burger King, Ketchup Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A nearby source of the SAB mentioned that it's too early to say what it's going to do, as they haven't received any offer.
"At this point, we are waiting and deciding," the source said.
Speculations about a merger, which would most likely cause concern about the infringement of competition rules in markets such as the United States and China, have been circulating for many years.
The timing of the approach, after more than a decade of purchases by AB InBev, follows a decrease of approximately 15% of the price of SABMiller shares from August onwards.
"It's exactly the moment they were expecting," added analyst Phil Gorham at Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) per SAB Miller action, maybe even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to 130 billion USD, which would also include the SABMiller debt.
This would be the most significant M&A transaction of 2015, which is already announced one year record after the 2008 financial crisis in terms of the sum of the transaction, and one of the largest purchases in 1980 here.
SAB shares were close to £19.9 per cent at £36.14, giving him $90 billion in stock exchange capital.
AB InBev actions have reached 6.4%.
Rivalii Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could seek another fusion as a defense strategy, as happened in the previous year when he offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottler with Coca-Cola (KO.N.), and in recent weeks there has been a suspicion of a combination with Diageo or Australian Coca-Cola Amatel (CCL.AX).
The overall quota on the beer market of AB InBev, producer Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 2.11% in 2014 while SABMiller was 15%, according to experts from the Plato Logic industry.
AB InBev intends a relationship between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) 2 times since the present 2.5.
It is possible to reach the target in 2016, the closest realistic date to which the transaction could be concluded, so it would have how to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought the company that produced Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with 52 billion dollars, the biggest ice money purchase in history at that time. He let the report grow to over 5 times.
A climb as big would allow him to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
Families that control AB InBev own a little more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders of SABMiller are the manufacturer of cigarettes Othera (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Othera refused to make statements about the fact that they were approached by AB InBev, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said at an analysis conference that it regularly assesses investment in SABMiller and that “this time we believe that maintaining assets is in the interests of our shareholders”.
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, head of European investment, equity, at Allianz Global Investors, who has actions in both companies, says AB InBev has faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of income from small debt amounts to about 15%.
However, we believe that the profit obtained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage of 8%, after 10 years," Dwane said.
In the case of any combination there are significant weights related to the infringement of competition rules, in particular in the United States, where companies hold approximately 70% of the beer market.
"The economies that could be done in distribution operations are great, and the feet related to the violation of competition rules are even bigger," said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent of the company's shareholding held by SABMiller, in accordance with the operating agreement governing it.
A change of control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get another 8 percent and appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would be entitled to the first and last bids for the remaining 50 percent.
A Molson spokesman refused to comment on whether the company was interested in an auction, but Molson's shares increased by more than 12 percent to their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is SABMiller’s CR Snow partnership with China Resources (0291.HK).

Pakistani police accused a former Air Force pilot of helping Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who subsequently donated funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, said on Wednesday police officers for Reuters, in a rare case targeting those who help finance activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban militias at a hospital in eastern Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militiamen involved in an attack in May on a bus with members of the Muslim minority and ismaelian minority, after which 45 people died, said to the top police officer Naveed Khawaja from the Department for the Combating of Terrorism of the province.
He will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has more funded the Afghan Taliban, we are still conducting research to see if he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him," said the officer.
"He also offered financial aid for AQIS," he said, referring to the Al Qaeda organization on the Indian Subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, who face activism, corruption and crime.
After, in December, the Taliban prisoners massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to suppress activism.
There were severe attacks, while the army also entered tribal regions outside the Afghanistan border.
But militant groups remain a threat and many have followers of Pakistani cities that are under the control of very poorly prepared police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52, used to preach to a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Housing Authority.
His public predictions were moderate, but in particular he encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at Pakistani Air Force College in Sargodha city and left Pakistani Air Force in 1998, another security officer for Reuters under anonymity said.
He subsequently entered the paint and chemical industry.
Rapper Rick Ross was denied copyright application for "Everyday I'm hustlin"
New York rapper Rick Ross can't claim his copyright for the words "Everyday I'm hustlin'", decided an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO music group, who sold shirts with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
In a decision published on Tuesday by the Federal Court of Miami, District Judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross' slogan, prominent part of his 2006 debut hit, "Hustlin'", is a short expression for which the courts have repeatedly mentioned that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' court ruling weakens the copyright infringement process that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, filed against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the electropop duet in Los Angeles, made up of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own famous 2010 song "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflin".
The star hip hop said that the song LMFAO is "an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of the song Hustlin'".
He also sued Kia Motors for the use of the Party Rock Anthem song in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright by selling shirts and other products with the shufflin' slogan.
In the judgment on Tuesday, Williams says that "Hustlin'", as a song, is protected by the law of copyright.
But Ross' three-word slogan is made up of ordinary words and can't have copyright, she said.
The judge compared it with other famous music versions of the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it's "a short expression, which all courts unanimously declared as impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the song of the LMFAO band is an unauthorized copy of "Hustlin'".
The process is scheduled for October.
The lawyers of Ross and LMFAO could not be contacted immediately for the statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al., at the U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, Nr.

Dr Carson is approaching Trump in the most recent presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the most recent presidential survey for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson approached the bomb leader Donald Trump in the preliminary republican elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush fell into polls with seven points.
After the support of 27% of Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times survey, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, arrives in second place with 23 percent, followed by Bush, television star Mike Huckabee, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, each with 6 percent.
Support from Republican voters in preliminary elections increased from early August to early September for Trump, Carson, Governor of Ohio John Kasich and former Executive Director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, on single-digit numbers.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and leading the Bush family standards further, fell by seven percentage points in one month, while the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker fell by eight points.
In the last survey, support for Walker is 2%.
Carson received more support than Trump among college graduates (29% compared to 21%), while Trump is ahead of Carson in the preferences of non-university voters (30% compared to 19%).
Trump is supported more by men than by women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the survey said that they were determined to support in their state's preliminary elections.
Those who said I know who they'll vote with twice as much support Trump as Carson.
It's still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters for preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey conducted between 9 and 13 September will be made public Tuesday before a presidential debate.
Carson's ascension to this poll reflects that of the senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of Democrats to the president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The last follow-up of the presidential nominee of CBS shows that Sanders rose by 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, New Hampshire, respectively, among the Democrats for preliminary voting.
A specialist in ethics claims that sexual robots should be prohibited
A leading ethic specialist in the robotics industry launched a campaign to ban the development of sexual robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, robotics expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
“The sexual thefts seem to represent an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and the models of how they will look, what roles they will have, are very disturbing,” she said for the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
He's inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology," she said for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will help increase the degree of sexual exploitation.
Although the sexual robots that are now manufactured are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that these are the first step towards something more sinister.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we need to stop it from the front.
Certainly, industry seems to take the lead.
A few years ago, the company producing True Companion's inflatable dolls launched Roxxxy, the "first sexual robot in the world".
However, concern about the possible dangers posed by artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among major industry representatives.
Even this spring, the executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk of something truly dangerous in five years.
In an interview with BBC last December, the physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race."
UK welcomes the first refugees from Syria - RT UK
The following days, Great Britain will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war, announced Theresa May's Interior Minister.
They will receive assistance under the extended reinstallation programme of the government.
Refugees looking for asylum arrive from camps on the border with the country torn apart by war.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees that the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Minister of Internal Affairs said the government "works fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that the assistance and support that they need and deserve be developed.
I know that the honourable members and the general public want more details on the number of persons and the date on which they are expected to arrive.
May noted that the government must also make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate provisions when they arrive.
I must point out that the level of expansion requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything is done properly.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister, Richard Harrington, will continue to keep the House up to date on this matter.
But I am delighted to tell the House that we are waiting to meet the first wave of refugees in the next few days and work quickly to plan more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron provoked the wrath of parliamentarians and militia when he unveiled the government's refugee plan, many of whom believed the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron told the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to the height of its moral responsibility" and will receive 20,000 refugees from camps in the Middle East until the following general elections.
He added that refugees will not automatically receive full asylum, but a humanitarian status that will allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics noted that the figures meant only 12 refugees a day, and the former Liberal Democratic Parliamentarian Paddy Ashdown said the measures were "deridors".
Further, Ashdown revealed that the children included in this scheme are to be deported when they are 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
Major public figures and personalities have also condemned the measures.
In a common letter, great names such as Benedict Cumberbach, Colin First, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said that the response to the crisis is “too little, too late”.
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of countries close to the conflicts that drive people away from their homes," they wrote.
Rubla is recovering from global insecurity fund - RT Business
The Russian rouble was strengthened on Wednesday, being traded with 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow stock exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say that the return of ruble occurred due to the reaction of investors to current global market disturbances caused by China's weights, the possible increase in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve and the over-reacted response to cheap oil.
The Brent quotas increased by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching 48.36 USD per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, at $45.31 per barrel.
MORE CITIZENS: Most likely, interest rate will increase in the United States by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is possible that volatility will say its word, fuelled by insecurity about China and the moment of the increase in the federal interest rate, which will continue to pay the tone for oil and ruble prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, an expert in monetary policy strategies on emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the reinforcement of Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began buying rubles.
Global markets await the decision on Thursday of the Federal Reserve, whether or not it will increase interest rate.
Markets believe that what could be the first growth in nine years of the US interest rate will not happen and have traded on Wednesday's highest rates.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together in the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the U.S. government and companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephony company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to book flight space blocks.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Collaboration comes as a result of a very widespread restlessness about the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial planes.
A new Forrester report describes in living colors the potential negative effect.
“Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco,” says the research.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to Detta O'Cathain, Baroness of the House of Lords, the concern grew on the background of reports on events at the limit of the production of an accident and the operation of drones over football stadiums, near nuclear power stations and Eiffel Tower.
"In the last two years, over 400 calls to the Metropolitan Police have been related to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
What is the solution: to build a system that pursues all drones, in particular those that fly to a height of less than 150 meters, whether they are driven by commercial pilots or amateurs.
“As more and more drones conduct commercial flights at low altitudes, beyond the level of driver visibility, or even fully autonomous flights, a certain air traffic management infrastructure is required to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, e.g. delivery of parcels in cities,” she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as air space design, methods of avoiding adverse weather conditions and wind, congestion management, route planning and redirection by similar methods to the rules established for road traffic, such as signalling and bandwidth.
They are expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is going to explode in the European Union over the next few years.
"We already see small and innovative EMS companies in the United Kingdom using this technology with considerable effects in the energy, agriculture and media industries," says Lord Tariq.
Over 670 permits for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Discike button: Why does Facebook want to know what makes you sad
"A Look Back" works like this, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for many users inside the virtual borders of Facebook, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, a button of empathy will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge amount of Facebook - about 240 billion dollars after the last statistic - is due to the unimaginable amount of consumer data it owns.
Every interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered together and build a remarkable picture of complex, in a permanent update, about your person and about your preferences.
This is most valuable for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to choose carefully what people will see ads on Facebook, selecting those that are most interested in their products.
One empathy button adds another set of data and certainly opens a door for another type of advertising agents to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who "appreciate" a national football team, charitable organizations and promoters want to address those who, for example, "enhancing" with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see in the News.
Facebook uses incredible intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to narrow that huge universe of content that you could see in the smallest stream you actually see.
This algorithm essentially depends on what you thought was interesting in the past and, above all, on what you liked.
There is no doubt on Facebook that many interesting posts, but unfortunate ones don't enter the algorithm, because people don't feel they should be appreciated.
However, if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it might make a decision to delete these kinds of posts from News.
Facebook has carried out experiments in the past to understand how what you see at News affects your emotional state and, in particular, how it is transmitted from person to person.
The academic environment representatives call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds sinister, it is probably just a simple attempt of Facebook (and published, with their agreement) to better understand how their platform works and whether they can adjust algorithms to distribute more elements.
What will happen with the empathy button remains the latitude of Facebook.
The real asset is the way in which a single company's decision to add one button to its services can produce so many speculations.
The reason for this can be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that operate hidden - have profound consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of life in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another one that leads to a constant struggle for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions it takes, including regarding new buttons, will be the ones considered best suited to remain on the surface in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with that and soon they'll have a button for this.
Biometric bracelets can anticipate crises in people with autism
During ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team established that the signals of the body can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent before they occur, thus giving the assistants the opportunity to take the right action.
Kids with autism we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say that his head hurts or that "here's too much noise" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body transmits to us, and we need to do this in a gentle and intrusive way.
For example, simple color visualization in an application can show the level of agitation. Red can be used to warn about a change in behavior, and blue for lack of interest, giving the nurse the understanding that the person is bored and needs stimulation.
Data from bracelets can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping caregivers understand the overall picture of how the person responds to various situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to make it very clear that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific for autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, Director of Customer Services at Wirral Autic Society, who will present technology at the Auttech 2015 conference on Autism and Technology from Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that it can bring as their life care technology. Now, apps for iPad give, in their own way, a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help the autistic children learn to play with your hiding.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can truly change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charitable organisation for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and are also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the following weeks"
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air raids on Syria's Isis targets, announced the government on Wednesday, just a few days after President François Hollande declared the intervention a "necessary".
France will unveil the first air raids on the Islamic State in Syria group "in the following weeks," said defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Wednesday.
The French Air Force carries out recognition missions in Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will follow “in the following weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets,” Le Drian said for the France Inter radio station.
Le Drian said Tuesday in parliament that the Islamic State has made “very significant progress” in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
“In the Great Town there is an extremely powerful offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what remains of it,” he said.
France is part of a U.S.-led coalition, which has bombarded Isis positions in Iraq for a year, but Holland changed its strategy last week to expand its actions in Syria, under conditions under political pressure are piled up on the merits of the jihadist threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on the Isis militants in Syria.
The feature of blocking ads from iOS 9 will make your phone even faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is launched on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying about online publishers - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new function will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, advertisements, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the mobile version of the Apple Safari browser.
At the tests, it was found that after blocking advertisements, news sites like New York Times are charging twice as fast, according to Reuters.
The blocking of advertisements also helps users to maintain the use of their data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop advertising blocking tool, has launched its own iOS web browser that limits advertisements; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People using advertising blocking software receive a few constraints.
Advertisements are still displayed in apps (from here Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, try to prevent their visitors from using such features to block ads.
However, their use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development poses great challenges for the online media, which is largely offered free of charge to consumers and has been financially supported for many years by advertising.
One report says that blocking advertisements could cost online publishers nearly 22 billion in advertising revenues only this year.
To activate the locking of ads in iOS 9, users must download an application for blocking advertisements, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama welcomed King Felipe VI of Spain to the White House on Tuesday, where the two discussed various subjects, but which were probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the king addressed the issue of the fight against the Islamic State and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - which is already facing hundreds of thousands of people who left their country of origin to leave west.
"Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travels, and the problem of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened in the last few months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially in the context in which Catalonia’s Spanish territory will vote in the elections that will take place this month.
"As far as foreign policy is concerned, we have committed ourselves firmly to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The Supreme Commander also told King Felipe that he would like to visit his country before the end of his term of office in 2017.
"We welcome you with open arms," Felipe answered.
The first lady, Michelle Obama, gave the Queen a tour of the White House and had a talk at tea.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States from the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to visit South Florida.
Alfre Woodard joins the Luke Cage series
The famous actress Alfre Woodard joined the distribution of the future Netflix Luke Cage series at Marvel. She will be an antagonist to Mike Colter, who plays the role of the superhero that gives the title to the series.
Woodard will play the role of Mariah Dillard - "a local politician from Harlem and cousin of Cornell 'Cottonmouth' Stokes recently announced, played by Mahershala Ali - who intends to bring an era of change on the streets he has grown," says a press release.
Her personal life and career are given to her by the newest hero of Harlem, Luke Cage, but also by the infamous actions of her cousin Cottonmouth.
"Alfre has an incredible, unique and intimidating presence on the screen, which makes it perfect for the role of leader of the community in Harlem," said Jeph Loeb, executive producer and president Marvel Television.
We are delighted that an actress as famous and talented as Alfre has agreed to join us in this adventure.
The series will have its debut in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Coker will write the first two episodes and will work as showrunner and executive producer.
Woodard, aged 62, is known for TV series Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, L.A. Law, desperate brides and law firm, but also for movies Devil's lawyer, mysterious obsession, The Family That Preys, 12 years of slavery and Annabelle.
Luke Cage is one of four Marvel series from the Netflix franchise.
Soon, too, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist will be broadcast, but also the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" have the world premiere on the same day
Fox foresees many positive results before the premieres of two of his most expected series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season of Queens and the second season of the Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal premiere.
As Variety reports, the strategy is an applied trend for high profile series, as global social network traffic guarantees success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to make use of the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series that is being talked about very much, such as Empire and Screen Queens," said Fox International channel president Hernan Lopez, according to Deadline.
"We're just waiting to broadcast these very interesting shows for fans all over the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve every day bring the success of a series to the premiere and throughout its life cycle.
The next season in the Empire, in which they will play famous celebrities like Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, will debut in September.
The new Scream Queens series, where Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande will play, will be broadcast the next day in September.
Members of the British Royal Family will take part in the World premiere of the film "Spectre"
Prince Harry and the Duke and Duke of Cambridge will take part next month in London at the World premiere of the latest film by James Bond, "Spectre".
Kensington Palace announced the news Wednesday on Twitter, appointing the premiere as Royal Film Performance for Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release by the producers, "Spectre" is the third Bond film chosen as RFP in 1946 here.
In the past, royal premieres have been selected and "Don't die today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on 26 October at the Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charity, which will benefit employees from the British film and television industry.
The premiere will also include actors from the film distribution, including lead actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go on the red carpet with members of the royal family.
"Spectre" will be broadcast in U.S. cinematographs in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The model Christie Brinkley and the musician John Mellencamp were seen Monday taking dinner together, sparking the rumor that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at Bowery Hotel in New York City, where photos caught Brinkley happy and smiling.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing jeans, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken jeans, trousers and boots.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend who split up and with whom she constantly cares, actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the star of Message for you at the NBC Today show, saying it was "an angel who was sent to me and I am very happy."
He added that "nothing ends until it ends."
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, posted for Seventeen magazine, following her mother.
The Arctic mosquito kings are big enough to take down a karib
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable due to the growing climate, but global warming has proved a benefit for others.
One of these favored species is the Arctic mosquito.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, the warmer temperatures in the Arctic region allowed the mosquitoes here to appear early and grow bigger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers from the John Sloan Dickey Centre for International Understanding from Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to illustrate the effects of changes in temperature on Arctic mosquitoes.
Their analysis anticipates a 50% increase in adult mosquito survival under a 2-degree increase in temperature.
The mosquitoes are small, but they are important members of the Arctic Trophy Chain and the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in the Procedures of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists anticipate better how a population of growing mosquitoes could affect the karib with which they feed, the birds and insects that feed them and the plants they pollen.
To build its demonstration, scientists from Dartmouth have combined their results from the field with laboratory experiments that have investigated how temperature influences insect development and the predisposition to be hunted by predators.
Although the increase in temperature makes the mosquitoes more vulnerable to collectors, it also gives them an early start in spring and makes the development of their larvae faster and more efficient, which certainly represents an advantage.
More mosquitoes mean a larger population, which can develop only to the extent that insect feed sources can support it.
The ability of mosquitoes to turn their improved survival rate into an improved breeding rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies point out that the administration of antidepressants in pregnant women has no effect on the neural or behavioral development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin recuperation inhibitors (SSRIs) present an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is an even greater risk for women and their children, which is why it should be treated.
"These studies add an increasing set of evidence regarding the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy," said a press release John Thorp, deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, which published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, so far the evidence seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are greater than those of antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the development of motors of children whose mothers treated with SSRI, analyzing the data of 51 404 children from the Norwegian cohort study of mother and child, investigating the effects of the use of SSRI for the development of motor skills at the age of 3.
Researchers found that 381 mothers had been using SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of them had been treated with long-term medicines.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in motor development, researchers wrote in the study that the association “was not as significant as giving delay a clinical importance”.
A group of researchers from Australia's Adelaide University conducted a data review of 49 000 women from the Danish National Birth cohort to discover the effects of SSRI administration on children's behaviour up to the age of 7.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
In 210 of children whose mothers had been treated with SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared with 231 children who were more prone to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more likely to bleed after birth if they are treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal haemorrhage increased by 5% between 11 and 16% if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers have reported.
Researchers said that although the study linked the administration of SSRI with increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from the drugs taken during birth to the limited amount of information that researchers had about women's specific medical conditions - which could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
“It is possible that women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy were those with the most serious stage of the disease, and that is why the risk of postnatal, not antidepressants bleeding can be increased,” says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study, we do not recommend that women stop treatment against depression during pregnancy, but be closely monitored to reduce the risk of potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder in the case of murder of students from Virginia Technical University
The man charged with killing the student Hannah Graham from Virginia University was charged with murdering qualified in the case of a student from Virginia Technical University who disappeared in 2009, announced the authorities on Tuesday.
The great jury in Albemarle, Virginia, charged Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. on Friday, aged 33, in Charlottesville, for the murder of Morgan Harrington, the officials say.
Matthew is also accused of kidnapping with intent to rape.
Each head of charge shall receive the maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Harrington, aged 20, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say that the news of the prosecution brought them ease.
"For six years we've been working hard and busy for this purpose," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm thrilled to know that when you take someone's life, you have to suffer the consequences for your actions.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to be seated.
Police say there is a medical-legal connection between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 sexual abuse in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty for this and awaits the sentence in this case.
He's staying in jail in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew charged with qualified murder in the event of the death of a student from Virginia University
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17, 2009, with his friends at a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington left John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't go back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a taxi around 8:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed in a black T-shirt with Pantera.
After her disappearance, Harrington's bag and mobile phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends began an extensive search of Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. The Metalica people wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt he wore was found near a line of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated lan, on a southwestern Charlottesville farm.
During the time of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew had worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it is unclear whether that period overlaped with the date Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the event of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were linked by DNA evidence.
The investigators did not make public at the moment the details of the new evidence that led them to put Matthew under charge for Harrington's murder.
Defense attorney Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham's case, refused to make statements.
The announcement of the prosecution comes two days after Hannah Graham's death in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both of them were young students who disappeared when they went out to the city in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a mall in the center near U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the first days after Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at the meetings and watches organized for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says he endured for her daughter speculations and media criticisms that must be silenced by the new counts of prosecution against Matthew.
"There have been talks all this time about "Why was she wearing short skirt?" and "and she's looking for it with candle?" but this kind of question and judgment are not valid when it's clear that we have to deal with a predator on the trail of hunting," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault on a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who at the time of the attack was 26 years old, told the jurors that, one night in September, while she was coming home on foot from the store, a stranger came behind her.
She took her to a green zone, beat her up and held her throat, then attacked her sexually.
"I thought the end came, that I had to scream constantly," the woman confessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew suddenly ran away, said the woman.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew might have been scared of the lights of a car entering a parking lot nearby.
He was convicted years later after the DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will receive the sentence in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said he would most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least today I've taken a step," says Dan Harrington.
Did Jon Snow die or not?
The Harington Kit Actor gives us a clue
Actor Kit Harington gave an important clue about the fate of the character or the Game of Thrones series, Jon Snow, which was killed at the end of the fourth season.
In an interview with Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knows how long the contract is or HBO post, according to Digital Spy.
Asked how many seasons he will appear, he pointed out that he cannot talk about this subject.
Let's just say that the show will be part of my life for a while, I'll probably be over 30 when it's over.
But one thing is certain.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then it will be the time when I will be buried in projects with feature films," said the actor.
The show comes back on little screens in the spring of next year.
The Fans Games of Thrones triggered a hysteria after the end of the fourth season, when the character Jon Snow was stabbed and launched various theories, according to which he will somehow be restored to life.
Moreover, the Romans created an event on Facebook, called "Poman of Jon Snow", 40 days after the end of the season, which swept over 36,000 supporters.
Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Medium" programmes, both interrupted in early April 2015.
According to a statement by the representative of Romania of the European Commission following this decision, about 120 million euros will be transferred to the Roman authorities in the following period.
I am pleased to announce the release of these payments and appreciate the efforts of the Roman authorities to improve management and control systems within the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weaknesses and solving problems.
"I express my hope that the measures taken will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," said European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Corina Cretu.
"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the head of Hungarian diplomacy reacted.
Peter Szijjarto asked European Socialists to stop "the campaign of lies" at Hungary.
Referring to statements made by Harlem Desir, French Secretary of State for European Affairs, on the fence built by Hungary, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European immigration strategy", insisting that national borders should be protected.
Romania wants to hit the rugby World Cup

"We want two winners, with the Canadian and Italian teams," Mihai Macovei, captain of Romania, said.

Refugee crisis: No solution at all
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, announced that Thursday will take a decision on the possible convening of a summit of the European Union on migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann called for a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis on Tuesday next week.
In a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot handle the refugee crisis alone.
The head of the German executive expressed support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls on the massive influx of asylum seekers, noting that the measure aims to facilitate the registration of refugees.
On the other hand, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redistribute refugees between Member States on the basis of compulsory quotas - has decided to organise an extraordinary EU summit.
EU Interior Ministers meeting Monday evening in Brussels failed to adopt the new proposal to urgently redistribute 120,000 refugees between Member States of the European Union, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the emergency relocation mechanism of refugees, provides for the rapid redistribution of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, we controversial cartoons
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo again provokes controversy after publishing cartoons that mock the response of the predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries affected by war.
In the most recent issue of the publication, attention was drawn again, as well as criticisms on social networks, writes Reuters.
One of the drawings infests an embodiing image of Aylan Kurdi, the innocent Syrian boy, whose body arrived on one of the beaches in Turkey, after an earnest attempt to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing shows a child in shorts and T-shirts, with face down on the big hill, next to an advertising panel offering two children's menus at one's price.
"So close to succeed," is the message accompanying the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack at the Paris editorial office in January, is accompanied by the message "The proof that Europe is Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who goes on the water, while a smaller character wears shorts with legs up in the water, first saying "Cristines go on the water", takes the second "Muslim children drown".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after it was the target of an attack by Islamist militants in January, as a result of repeated threats following the mockery of the prophet Muhammad.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, fined dramatically in Russia
The French Auchan supermarket chain was fined with more than $370,000 by Russian officials, being charged with food security failures.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian agency for consumer protection Rospotrebnadzor, said that the fines total more than 25 million rubles, i.e. 372,000 dollars, reports the agency Associated Press, quoted by US News.
However, the reasons why these fines were granted were not specified, and Auchan made no comment.
Also, the French chain of supermarkets is the target of Russian agricultural agency charges, which argue that some meat products have been detected as infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls are coming in a period of tension between France and Russia, with a view to extending the sanctions of the European Union and France's decision to cancel an agreement on the provision of Mistral Russian ships.
The Roman Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the news that Hungary could raise a metal fence at the border with our country.
MAE seems to have been brief in connection with this decision and that this is not a politically correct gesture.
MAE shows, in a release to the editorial journal.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced to the public.
In turn, the MAE immediately informed the relevant decision-makers in Romania in connection with this situation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a fence between two EU Member States and being strategic partners is not a political gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian party, which is also shown in the communication.
Hungary plans to build a metal fence on a border segment with Romania, in the context of the immigrant crisis, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, quoted by Mediafax.
"The measure is necessary for traffickers of people transiting Serbia to change their routes, with the probability of heading towards Romania," explained the head of Hungarian diplomacy.
"The Gard would start from the point of border between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the pressure of migration moved to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants transiting the territory of Sardinia on their way to the European Union were attempting to go through the fence built by the Hungarian authorities through its eastern edge, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, non-Community immigrants have discovered that they can go around the fence through the area of the towns of Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Government of Hungary has allocated 22.2 billion forensics (71.8 million euros) to build a controversial metal fence at the border with Serbia, on a distance of 175 kilometers, and for special centres needed to accommodate immigrants.
The fence initiative is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
There's no need, he'll stay there.
The unsuspecting body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor will not be deposited in the Senate of Romania, despite the desire to do so expressed by the widow of the politician.

PNL Senator Teodor Atanasiu argued that this request "is not in agreement with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
It also transmits Agerpres, senators have held a moment of recalling former PRM leader, at the proposal of Senator UNPR Serban Mihailescu.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died on Monday evening around 6:30.
The president of the PRM passed to the Emergency Clinic of Cardiovascular Diseases of the Army.

Are refugees coming to Romania?
Mayors of the border localities, questions about accommodation places
The mayors of the border towns of Arad county are questioned by the Police and Border Police, these days, about the accommodation places for any refugees that could reach Romania, and also for the Jandarmi, if they will be mobilized at the border.
The building of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were conducted with farmers in the area, who were asked to report on the presence of any strangers near the border.
We had talks with border police, the National Police and the Local Police, as well as with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I asked the farmers, who have work during this period on arable land, to be careful and report any movement," the building said.
Immigrant crisis in Hungary: Armoured and water cannons on the border
He, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said that the police asked for information on the accommodation available in the case of bordering with a wave of refugees.
We've been asked how many people we can afford.
We don't have spaces for refugees in the municipality.
We believe that such special centres don't even have to appear at the border, because they're harder to control here, because migrants are tempted to escape, because they're not interested to stay in Romania.
It would be best to be set up such centres in areas far away from the border," said Mayor of Iratosu, Papp Atila Iosif.
On the other hand, the mayor of Dorobanti, Vincentu Almasi, said that there were so many places to stay for refugees, as well as for intervention forces, in case they were mobilized in the area.
The police were interested if we could hunt down and get married.
We could find places at the Cultural Road, but for refugees we have no accommodation.
"We've been questioned about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," said Vincentu Almasi.
He added that at the local police station, "starting on Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it has established itself permanently."
"There's always a cop at the station, and the locals know that they have to inform if they notice any strangers in the area," said the building.
The representatives of the Mayor Pilu said that they can house as much as one hundred people, at the Cultural Way, the information being provided to the police, upon their request.
Also, the mayor of the city Curtici, Nicolae Aanitei, said that there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of local public finances, but here are necessary arrangements.
Also, a former border police barracks could be arranged to host refugees.
The representatives of the Arad County Police Press Office did not provide an opinion on the question of mayors during this period, only confirming that "in the border towns of Arad county, patrol activities have been intensified".
Army Club Commander announces radical measures against Becali Star
Army Sports Club Commander, Colonel George Boroi, announces a series of radical measures that will be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Although the two parties negotiated a stake, Boroi claims that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historical cover of the ro-blues.
The team who won the Champions Cup is on the break for now.
"It's not a historic break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have a team, but things can change from next year," Boroi said to Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the process by which he seeks damage from the Becali team will continue.
The period we refer to by ICCJ decision is very clear.
We need to recover the damage from FC Steaua, the team that used the Star brand without the propieter's acceptance - i.e. CSA Steaua.
It appears very clear and the continuity of the section, which was in fact permanent of the Army Club.
"So the Bucharest Star football team, in one form or another, but in one legal form, must exist as a continuation of the perfumes it has so far in palmares," says George Boroi.
The Star of Becali and the Army Club were in the open war since the end of last year, when the supreme instant decided that the military are the ones holding the "Star".

According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated assets of the millionaires in Asia Pacific will exceed a total of $15,800 billion recorded in 2014, as well as the assets of the millionaires in North America, which currently represent the richest people in the world, with a cumulative wealth of $16,200 billion, transmits AFP.
The study states that the Asia Pacific region already has the highest number of very rich people, named in the financial jargon High Net Worth Individuals, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, compared to 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are persons who can invest at least a million dollars, without taking into account the value of real estate and other possessions.

"Dorel" mounted the traffic lights in reverse
At Suceava, the workers mounted a traffic light up, so instead of being aware that they had another 4 seconds to wait, passersby get the "h" message that I don't know how to decipher.
Don't wash them, but everyone else walks the red, informs the truth.
Each one passes like he cuts his head off.
Two boys were to be taken up by a car because they passed the red.
"Policies at the Route should be here, to help, until the world gets used to it," said a woman for the quoted source.
The traffic light was recently mounted in front of the Great Piete in central Sucevei, but passersby do not seem to care more about it, as much as the information received seems to be inconceivable.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" was doing his job properly and someone was found responsible enough to give him the ok for the completion of the work, then he would never have come to this absurd situation.
Chief of Administration Strazi and Systematization The route of the Suceava Mayor recognized with cantonation as it was the face when the traffic light began to work, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We gave them in use, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"Even I was face to face when they were put into service," said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be corrected as soon as possible.
Thank God it can be corrected, because there are situations where "Dorel" has done irreparable damage.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Ruse gas pipeline, "Dorel" missed the drilling mill that dug the tunnel under the Danube, it is not known where, probably under the ground, buried, however it was not found, as even supported by the Minister of Economy, Mihai Todose.
Police put the water cannons on immigrants
On the main border of Hungary with Serbia, Hungarian granites used water cannons and tear gas against immigrants on Wednesday.
Although Hungary closed the border with a barbed sarma fence and introduced tough measures against illegal immigrants, including arrest, on the Sarbo-Ungara border continued to gather refugees, The Guardian writes.
The water cannons were put into operation when the immigrants managed to patrol through the squirm fence through the crossing point at the Roszke border.
Hungarian police support that gun action was a multi-mime control measure that throws water bottles.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people were tearing after the use of tear gas.
The publication Elena Enikos at the same time writes that two German companies refused to deliver the sarma gimpata Hungary.
Tara has already raised the fence to the border with Serbia and Tuesday has announced her intention to raise one and to the border with Romania, a strongly criticised initiative in Bucharest.
German companies support that ghimpata sarma is very dangerous and causes cuts that can be infected.
It is used to secure prisoners or military installations, but should not be used against people looking for shelter, support companies.
In parallel with the Hungarian border confrontations, Croatia has mobilized to make it available to bus immigrants to transport people to the country border with Serbia.
Croatian Interior Ministry confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centers.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, including 73 children, further showed the Ministry.
Tsipras, about Greece's drama - why he agrees with the third EU agreement
The declared purpose of the former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from more austerity and to fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels.
Finally, the leader Syriza made out of Greece part of a third loan agreement for this country, which also involves several years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which is conducting an interview with him.
Now, however, Tsipras asks the Greeks to re-entrust the prime minister's mandate in elections on which he claims his political position will be raised.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the dismantling of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring debt for Greece remains open," said former prime minister Elen.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have ended in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the financing part of the agreement represents a great success for the Greek government, showing that all the financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says that Greece "must definitely need reforms," stating that the state reform must begin.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections, in September, after 7 stormy months at the head of the Executive of Athens, the period when a third loan savior for Greece was approved.

Actress from Star Trek, in jail for undressing in front of children
Actress Jennifer Lien, known in Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, inquiring Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that took her to prison, where she was on September 3rd -- bail being set at $2,500 -- took place in front of her Tennessee home.
Vedeta began to argue with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of his children who was crying, inform Mirror.

They're in sight with the Western machine gun.
Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar of Assad has given a rare interview to the Russian press, in which he talks about refugees and accuses the West as supporting terrorists and "and seeing them" to immigrants.
"The West mourns for them and the West supports terrorism from the beginning of the crisis, when he said this was a panic revolution," Assad said, in an interview with Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus claims that his Western counterparts say about the situation in Syria that it is terrorism like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or Syrian regime or the Syrian president."
As long as this propaganda follows, they will have more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept them or hugged them as refugees, it's about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, stop supporting them.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of the whole refugee issue," added the Syrian leader.
Assad continued his accusations at the Western States and with regard to their treatment of refugees.
It is as if the West now cries for refugees with an eye and takes them in view with the second-eyed machine gun, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, mainly because of terrorists and crimes and second-hand because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and the destruction of the infrastructure, you will not have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to win their own existence somewhere in this world," says Bashar of Assad.
"If we were asking any Syrians today what they want, the first thing they would say would be 'We want security and security for each person and every family'," said the Syrian president, adding as political forces, whether inside or outside the government, "we should unite around what the Syrian people want."
Sirie's president believes that his country's dialogue should continue "to reach a consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless we break terrorism in Syria".
"I want to take advantage of this opportunity to ask all the forces to join against terrorism, because it is how we can achieve the political goals that we, as Syrians, want through dialogue and political action," Bashar of Assad said.
He also spoke about one of his country's allies, Russia's president Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, he was turned, from the friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar of Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West again for falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the hit in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a tar.
He is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses Russia's opposition and who came to power through non-democratic means, despite the fact that he was elected in democratic elections, and the West himself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, I'm no longer democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," the Damascus leader pointed out.
Not lastly, it included Russia on the list of friends - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, alongside Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
Instead Bashar al Assad criticized Turkey, another neighbour country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, about which he said that "I can't even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries."
In addition, Syria's president accuses the "international coalition", led by the United States, which fights against terrorism: "In fact, since this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State has begun to expand."
In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact on the field.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide a cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight terrorism.
You can't be with terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will hatch you - then we have no object in cooperating with all these countries, considering that it is a real and not false coalition that fights against terrorism," said the leader of Damascus.
Autumn?
Not at all.

Map of countries with the highest prices and how Romania is located
The collapse of the oil quota has caused major losses in the last year of workers in the extraction of the title, the shareholders of the energy companies and countries that depend heavily on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: gasoline has been very cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, between October 2014 and July 2015, in almost all 76 countries taken into account, the fuel price has fallen.
The most important price reduction in the pump is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine cost 97% so you can feed 24 SUVs less than a dollar.
At the opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is kept fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the conditions of refining, the changes in taxation, as well as the fluctuations in the exchange rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg has turned the average price of every state into US dollars.
Situation in Romania
Bloomberg data shows that, in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (approximately 3.8 litres) was $5.49.
So we're graded 27 in the country with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in top.
The last quarter of 2014, gas was also cheap in the Romans.
At that time, the average price of one gallon was $6.14, which means a discount of 10.6%.
However, the surrounding countries are even better off.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of gas costs $4.92 and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Germans set up the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Tuesday night that the federal government would give additional support to the 16 federal landfills in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants entering the country across southern Europe.
After a nearly four-hour meeting with prime ministers in the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to face the large number of refugees," notes the DPA agency.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals as well as distribution centers.
"I need such pivot points," she pointed out.
The whole country must provide a massive impulse to cope with the crisis, Merkel added.
Land Premiers called for more assistance than the 6 billion euros agreed by the federal ruling coalition more than a week ago.
Prime Minister of Turingia Bodo Ramelow of the Stanga Party requested a "little double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
In turn, the Prime Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also called for bureaucracy to manipulate refugees and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the trial in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
The Prime Minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
Until now, Bavaria bears the hardest burden, with the most migrants arriving after passing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a powerful actor on the federal scene as head of the Crestin-Sociale Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual open door policy at the beginning of the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu makes scandal after the humiliating defeat of Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nerve car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahtori Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach showed himself totally disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahtorior's lost because she was disadvantaged.
Before the game I said one thing, that I want to be respected.
Unfortunately, in the games with important teams in Europe we are always disadvantaged by arbitration.
There are two totally different ways.
We're given a yellow card right away, while the top teams aren't.
Besides, the first penalty wasn't in any case!
The ball hit back on Darijo, without touching his hand.
A game such a level should not be influenced by arbitration.
"Regreet that arbitration broke the game," said Mircea Lucescu at the press conference.
"Madam, but what smells so ugly here"?
They were pieces of the cut husband
A common sadism murder terrified the inhabitants of Târgu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hours of the day, the markets in Târgu Frumos were able to see terrifying scenes near the main entry into the market.
Along with the three graves, the criminals "assembled" from pieces what seemed to be a man's body.
It was broken, but his head, internal organs, and genitals were missing.
In the end, it would prove that it was the body of an former officer, who had been transcribed by his wife, the professor of geography.
The "Jiare de Iasi" has been talking to the deceased even with the cab driver who helped the killer, without knowing, to the carriage of the bags with the finished body.
His stories make your hair soft.
The one who alerted the police yesterday about the fact that a woman whose three bags were terrible, after pieces of the body had been found on the market, was a taxi driver from the Beautiful Târgu.
As in American films, the man himself helped carry bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, without knowing it, being the killer's client for a race.
The taxi meter told, exclusively for the "Jiaul de Iaşi", the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide the evidence.
He carried with his hands the bags in which were pieces of the body of the wife of the geography teacher, which he had laid.
She had come to the Beautiful Târgu to hide the evidence of the murder, as far away from her home as Roman.
Maybe she has mine.
I didn't know how you knew.
Nea Mihai, as it is known to his friends who practice taximetry in Târgu Frumos, has become star over the night in the small town he lives in.
He's seen American films throughout his life, but he never thought he'd ever get to be himself the one who's gonna stand at the back of the discovery of a sadistic crime, and see with his eyes pieces of corpses.
It tells us that, on Monday night to Tuesday, it usually expects the arrival of the buses that regularly transit the town.
It is close to the intersection of roads to Roman and to Pascans.
The taxi meter tells us that the killer woman observed it in the rear-view mirror, next to the bags with the body parts supported by the indicator showing the nearby localities.
She came in the night with the Massaro race from 1.30.
The bus left it ten meters away from passing pedestrians from Pascani, right on the edge where it shows the mileage.
The bags were screened with the indicator.
After the bus left, I gave in the marcher ten meters, up to it.
I opened the trunk and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Madam, but what does that smell so bad here?"
I saw there was an elderly woman, and I told myself to help her.
I thought he'd take meat to the market, get rid of it, maybe he's got my own, I didn't have any way to know.
I thought maybe she wanted to tease someone with that ugly smelly meat.
She was trying to pick up a bag alone, and I refused to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied up.
"He specified me to take her to the large market gate, when I took her from the bus," he started telling Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He added that the woman didn't say anything at all, and therefore he wasn't curious enough to ask her anything.
Until my destination, I didn't talk about anything, because I was nervous that he put my thief in the car.
And when he pulled the bags out of the car, I noticed that he smells even worse.
She took the bags out of the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I gave two yards back to get back, and I realized I can't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and I moved the car over and over here, to disappear the scent.
At the bus I didn't notice if someone was helped to get the bags down, because we had lights in the back and we didn't see well in the mirrors.
"There were two plastic bags and one of raffie," the man added.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, she says she's starting to be curious.
In my mind, I realized something wasn't right.
After he took his bags off, I went to the hospital, to the city hall, and when I came back, I especially looked at what the woman was doing with the luggage.
In the meantime, she had brought the luggage behind the fence, where there are the cellars inside the market.
Then I left again.
There was little excitement, because they arrived a microbus from Italy and a bus.
I saw the woman go to their drivers to get in, disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take it, because they have international races, and they don't take passengers on occasion.
The woman was very nervous, she was walking over and over.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, out of curiosity, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee answered that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where she was being police patrol, because I had seen her some time ago.
I looked for them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them it was something suspicious.
"Then I went somewhere else, a race to Belcești," Mihai completed.
He also told us that the woman had become agitated after she left the luggage in the dumpsters.
To me, suspicion left from the fact that the luggage was missing, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and they showed me, telling her that I noticed she had a suspicious luggage.
Then the woman went to the dumpsters and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to the place where he hid the bags around 3:00 when I gave statements to the police and prosecutors on the spot," ended his taxi driver's story.
The prosecutors in Neamț, who investigate the case, say that the 64-year-old teacher, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the viewing rooms of a Roman gas station at 0.55 hours, climbing with the three bags in the bus.
She arrived at the Beautiful Fair at 1.30.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, and then cut him in the house.
The man was called Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday night, the woman put the body pieces in two plastic bags, which she carried to the bus, and hid them.
Last night, he transported another one, then decided which direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iasi.
Last night, prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid the husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But the head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, in a closet in the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, prosecutors didn't find out from the woman who was the reason why she killed her husband with so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the professor will be a psychic expert, and the body will be examined by legal practitioners, to officially determine the cause of death and possible other relevant details.
The municipality took over the national roads from the municipality's range, after years ago they had been taken by the Government, so that they could be paved with money from the national budget, in the 2004 election campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and a decision by the Government is needed to be applied.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a rule because it is in the statue to grant the opinion for the U.S. General Banish Plan (PUG).
The municipality took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any case, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 obliges the municipality to take the national roads that transit the municipality.
No opinion can be issued from the National Roads if the law is not complied with, so that we need to approve this.
National roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, government decision will also have to be issued as a result of this decision of the Local Council," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The national roads that close the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The National Road 28 beats the Iașul on the arteries: road Păcurari, road Munteni (to be mafor), Moara de Foc, road Silvestru, street Silvestru, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. Primaveri, road Chisinăului, road Túțora until the exit from the municipality to Tomești - Albița.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the Buccium road, bd. Socola (until the traffic light), Buccium street (until the base 3), Chisinau road, bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and exit to Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Further description of files in the "folder" of Mircea Eliade's political sympathies of youth, which, however condensed, would have been presented beyond the size of a daily article and should be broadcast in the series, deserves, I believe, evoked the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most vicious charges used by the detractors of the great Romanian scholar.
A less humorous description would be, hopefully, useful in the real debate that the recent law, called "antilegione", would be appropriate to spark it in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analyzing the various versions that spoke of Eliade's regiment in the Legion through the "Axa" and Radu Gyr's Cuib, Florin Turcanu brings into discussion, in the volume Mircea Elias.
The prisoner of history (București, 2003), another hypothesis, which interests us in the highest degree in understanding the resumption of epistollary contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after playing Ceaușescu "the balcony scene" that August that year.
Based on documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the safety investigation, in 1941, documents stored today in the archive SRI (FD, File 573, f.15) and on a follow-up note in 1938, Florin Turcanu said that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in the so-called "legislationary family" called Luminita, a group of "cuiburi" by intellectuals, especially writers, led by poet Radu Gyr".
As regards the Luminita nest, there is no verifiable data, those in exile considering the existence of this questionable "legislation families", what must be discussed is, after all, the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving aside the surprising skill of the SRI to make these secret files available to Mr.Turcanu, it is more than obvious that, at that time, the aim of the pursuit of Security was "commander" Radu Gyr, the mention of Eliade, in accordance with the note of 21 March 1938, in the context where Armand Călinescu, the Interior Minister received his free hand to take all the measures necessary for King Carol to be able to impose his royal dictatorship, suspending his parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the legions that began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (the All Party for the Third Country in the 1937 elections).
The arrest of Eliade was carried out following this note, quoted by Turcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, framed in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a thin bureaucratic cover for the repression of 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes were made on the ground for the vast majority of legionaires or active supporters in the public space that were to be arrested, but which had to be linked by an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's holographic statement mentioned above, given in arrest, in February 1941, after the collapse of the legionation rebellion, merely confirms retrospectively on the first, the trivial method of bureaucratic coverage in any police regime, authoritarian.
It would have been interesting if Turcanu had provided more details on the content of the cited dossier 573.
Was it Eliade or Radu Gyr's file?
Because anyway it has to be a file built on the safety documents, but then processed by Security to be used against each other either.
It is here a misunderstanding, as in the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows how to make up the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it represents a preliminary stage, proof, in which the person concerned behaves as an active sympathizer, who was in the trial period of three years before becoming "cameraad" with acts in order.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as clubs or intellectual scenes, the residents, groups of conversation with peasants, youth organizations or gravitative students around a nest, were his "family", were not his own nest, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances completely escapes the unanticipated reader by making Eliade's "member" status (which can be plausible) understood and used ad literally to designate the political regiment in the nest.
Of course, the invocation of subtle interpretations of this genre cannot conceal the public support of the Guard and no clear sympathy for the Captain who animated Elias during 1935-1940, whether on the floor of Nae Ionescu or not.
The public support of a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean and the political regulation itself said as much as, normally, intellectuals of this size retains a type of superiority in the face of such activists and does not go into politics unless they are given direct high privileges.
As much as I could form an opinion about the thinking type of Elias from that time, when he was the "leader of the young generation", I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted hierarchical rigour from a legionary nest.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
To no longer mention, except in the past, the fact that, in any legionary "folder", what it receives is public anti-semitic activity and violence, both worthy of being stigmatized, but non-existent in the case of Elias, until new evidence.
With regard to the correspondence of Eliade-Gyr from 1968 to 1969, Mircea Hangoca, an enthusiastic defender of Eliade, tries to sanction Florin Turcanu's claims (though based on some archive documents, even if they had deserved to be dissected and contextualized more seriously) with a questionable argument.
The Hangoca Mircea finds, in the volume Noi glosse on Mircea Eliase (București, 2006), that "no part of the correspondence between Mircea Eliase and Radu Gyr contains any hint at this setting".
He had no way in 1968, when, somehow alive out of communist ocnes, Radu Gyr could not have risked an allusion in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think she wanted to stress is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, admiration and affection without any doubt about Elijah's descent.
There really is no palest suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been the chief of Elias.
Intelligent, the poet obliged to write to the Glass of the country, devotes himself from the head of the place the embarrassing condition signaling to Elias (who knew exactly what the mission had that publication that was constantly dealing with the denigration of the exile of the right), to the signature, after "your old friend", to what to expect and is visibly relieved and happy when it responds affectionately after almost three decades of separation since the "whirring time" has alienated them.
There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" with which he had been assigned (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could return at least peacefully to see his mother and friends) and that he, skilledly, fulfills it dry and by short sentences, separated from paragraphs, to suggest their character of foreign body, Radu Gyr shows his interest only for literature.
No mention of esoteric, refined political complicities suggested or any evocation of the years of youth in a register other than the cultural one.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior on Eliade's legional line, but until strengthening this version with less circumstantial evidence than those offered by Florin Turcanu, we have in these correspondents memories that testify to a mutual value of some characters who have markedly different, but statorically, our culture and who, beyond the rigorous trials of life, find the tone of civilization and interbelic education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not, instructive for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the fate "under the times" of authors.
In the early 1970s, Eliade finally gave up refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext of health problems and catastrophic flooding in the country, announced the authorities of the RSR, through the embassy (with a sporadic correspondence used to obtain passports for his sister), that he could not give course to the invitation to return to the country.
The next one was predictable: it is again put to index, set up in Israel "the Tolladot business", the cards sent to family and friends (Fragments d'un journal, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped from censorship, never see their mother again.
Among friends in the country only with Noica still has a sporadic correspondence though, surprisingly, as a personal archive from Chicago attests, a lot of private people or Romanian institutions are still able to send them messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr didn't get permission to write to him after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceaușescu regime tried Eliade's second conviction operation (through official invitations, Noica's moves, translations etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed into eternity.
New coach, foreign player
Due to the shortage of indigenous volleyballists, Penicillina Iasi tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exits take part in training tournaments under coach Dan Gavril
Retired in the first half of the year of Division A1 of female volleyball, Penicillina Iași kept its place in the first step due to the withdrawal and then the disappearance of the Miroslava Science band, newly promoted in the first step following a round of dams even in the exit.
The news took a bit on the unprepared leadership of the Jesuit group, who woke up without the main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, he arrived second in Bacău Science) and many missing players, some retired such as Cristina Lungu and the libre Diana Studineneu, or gone, like Ana-Maria Berdilla (at the Volei Alba Blaj champion) and Sisters Maria and Iuliana Fica.
Of course, until the re-initiation of the championship scheduled on 10 October, there was also time to complete the lot.
First there was found a new coach in the person of Dan Gavril, who came from the male team LPS Piatra Neamț and who has worked a little in recent years at Penicillina, he is proud to sign shortly a contract with the grouping led by the Left Vasile.
Then two players were brought from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconită, being tried and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to being the wild player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrinca Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, Dan Gavril's Peniciline lot performed a canton at the Gura Humorului, after which he took part in a tournament held at Lugoj and equipped with Banat's Cup, where the exits made a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but they also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, between September 23-25, Penicillina will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship we're trying to make up a valuable team.
We have a skilled and experienced coach, but Romania's player fund is quite small and that's why we will also call volleyballists from abroad, especially after the decision was made that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sports from Romanian clubs.
"We were hoping to reach the end of the competition year on 5-6 seats, even if it would be very hard," said Vasile Left, president of ACS Penicillina Iasi.
Thrilling meeting.
Males gathered after almost 70 years
Gemini George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, aged 69, were born at the end of World War II in Germany after their Polish mother had only been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too sick to care for them, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers being thus separated not only from the one who gave them life, but also from the other.
Tens of years George and Lucian didn't know one about each other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered the documents demonstrating that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the '60s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they didn't find any trace to lead them to Lucian.
Only in 2015, thanks to the program, the Restoration Family Links" of the Red Cross, the twins met again, and the moment was one more than exciting.
BBC reporters surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iasi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal were won by the Jesuit children at the German Open Championship from Stuttgart, an international sporting dance competition organized by the German Federation of Dance Sportiv and the World Federation of Dance Sportiv.
Five teams from Iasi were trained at the Dance Energy Club and danced along with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 Irish children participated in five different categories (youths 1, youth 2, junior 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with the medals were the pair: Rázvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Tarzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Stefana Gologan (bronz medal).
And three other pairs managed to occupy leading places: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Ioana Iosub Cujbe and not finally the pair Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionița.
As a coach I wanted to confirm the results achieved in March of this year, this reconfirmation is necessary for both us as teachers and sportsmen, as regards their future evolution.
The fact that we managed to hear Romania's anthem twice this year at German Open and to return home with four medals makes us very happy and gives us hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to the highest level.
"All these would only be feasible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," Andreea Ramona Manolache, coach to children at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, obtaining a total of 9 medals, thereby qualifying our country on 4th of the 20 participating countries.
Note that of the nine medals, four came to Iaşi.
6 methods to escape stress in a minute
Too few of us allow us to run off on a mountain weekend to escape stress.
Some keep our time, others their finances, and both their impediments.
There are, however, solutions to anyone who wants to escape a little stress.
They do not involve any high costs or special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
The day-to-day care is inevitable, but it depends on us how we make them face and what attitude we take of them.
Instead of grinding inside and feeling like an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the following relaxation tactics that don't steal more than a minute.
Deep Breathe
Breathing exercises are not intended solely for yoga soloists or practitioners.
They work for every man in part, and regulating breathing at a tense time helps release endorphins into the body, which leads to a state of relaxation, informs Livestrong.
Be a child
We know that we're past the age of childhood and we're not allowed to fall when we're in a mood.
But that doesn't mean we can't go to a corner of the office headquarters or wherever we know we're alone (even behind the building) and not type as we hold our lungs.
You can get rid of the nerves and negative energy accumulated over a day with a few shrieks.
Imagine a nice place.
We know that the recommendation sounds worthy of a reply from a psychotherapy session, but it's not enough for psychologists to use it often.
Imagining a beautiful place, which inspires us calm and detaching the daily frenzy, can lead to attenuating the mood of the nerve.
It's actually self-sustainment, a process that can even change lives, both for good and for bad.
Everything depends on what we're suggesting.
It's best to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to the music
Place your castles in your ears and listen to the relaxing music.
Attention, it's not about the favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal you might find yourself hard to relax.
Listen even to relaxing songs, which are lined and do not contain lyrics, to restore balance when you are lit up.
Decoy or orange
Does that sound weird advice to decoy an orange to the nerve?
Well, it's not!
Because it is not about fruit itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occasional, too total).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of orange shell during decoching stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, hormone of the well-being.
Eat an animal
Those who have animals close by, whether it's the one at home, or whether it's the one who's cut off next to the job, take a few seconds to handle it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal mangers may lower blood pressure.
Timing and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with some rival instruments, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous Romanian folklore pieces combining violin with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is entitled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found ourselves, and from that moment we were very happy to sing together, having a practically unlimited repertoire."
We thought this was the moment a violin met with a guitar.
Cristi: "From the first meeting we realized that we heard very well what we were singing and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work."
Each of us has learned from the other's repertoires and, what is very important, is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there's a meadow between classic music people and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And secondly, we stole a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who listen only to classical music listen and rock, and those who listen only to rock to get to play and classical music.
And I was surprised to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they would listen to this and they would also like it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and we find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, it seems to us great."
Students in Iasi were more in traffic than at school on the first day after vacation
Hundreds of Jesuits were "captives" yesterday morning in hell traffic in several areas.
The municipality announced that the Mangeron boulevard (slai Bahlu mal left) is now closed between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș.
The mayors of the city failed to fulfil their promises to carry out work for smoothing traffic at the start of the school year.
One of the assurances that the municipality has given, at least twice in the last few weeks, has found in the re-establishment of the tour in the International Guard area.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be mounted, and the last deadline for the work was the end of last week, yesterday the rotation was not carried out.
The nerves of the drivers were maximum spread to Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, considering that another promise of the city was also violated: the move of the customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Technopolis "until late until the end of August", in the context where this transfer is discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim mayor Mihai Chirica says that the problem at the International Station is more complicated.
The rotation will be made at the right time, we must take account of the traffic traffic in the area, an opinion must also be given from the National Roads.
"It's not like Zimbru, where it's time for the tram to stay on the turn, but we'll sort it out," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, he said, would be stopping the tram with a traffic light before turning.
Problems in circulation were also at the intersection of the Red Bridge.
The car tail on the street St. Lazar stretched to the SRI headquarters.
"I've been waiting for good minutes to get out in the red pod," said one exiter.
By Podu Roș in September they had to travel tramway to CUG, if the rehabilitation project "South functional artery development and rehabilitation" was completed within the initial run-up period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the initial one.
"We drew European funds for new works, for example, over-large, on the initial version of Nicolina's passage was narrow," Chirica commented.
The most recent deadline for the reintroduction of traffic traffic is October.
During yesterday, the Jesuits reported traffic problems especially in areas such as Păcurari, Centro (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armaean Street) or the intersection of Base 3.
The little one could go back to the CJ as head.
In the course of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The Judges of the Court will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the Judicial Council will be kept under judicial control and prohibitions.
The Judges of the Iasi Tribunal resolved a new deadline yesterday in the record "Album", where the accused is also the suspended president of the Iasi Judicial Council.
At the end of yesterday’s sitting, judges decided to take a judgment during tomorrow’s day on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against the Adomnite.
The latter wishes to reside or revoke this measure, which has been kept away from the head seat of the CJ for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is maintained by the higher court, Cristian Adomnita will be able to resume his role as President of the CJ.
The ADM was sued by the National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA), accused of favoring the perpetrator and false intellectuals after, say pro curatoria, it would have tried to mask an audit control following which a series of irregularities regarding the reception of a public contract signed between CJ and the Laser Co firm were discovered.
The ADM would have tried to hide that the institution it led would not have received more materials to promote Iași county, although these materials were written as received by the CJ.
Along with him were the courts and three directors of the CJ, but also the director of the Laser Co firm.
Another 3,500 people are expected to vote until September 25th.
The municipality is prepared to distribute other questions if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The Jesuits have only ten days left to express their opinion on replanting the teas on the pedestrian Stephen the Great.
According to the municipal officials, to date around 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed at the neighborhood centers and at three additional points in the city (Copou park, Alexandru al Good and Mayoria).
A record number of exits appeared on Sunday in front of the city hall.
According to the representatives of the civic group "Iashu loves teas", 530 Jesuits voted in 140 minutes, and almost four votes cast in every minute.
On the other hand, over the course of the month, approximately 440 people came to the same place.
The volunteers of the group say that many exiters advertise and the people of the country do not make the public consultation efficient.
They therefore made a call yesterday to internet users to print an information poster made available to the group and to paste it into the block stairs.
The volunteers also showed that at the additional point in the Copou park the last forms were completed by exits on Sunday.
We'll offer formulation from the neighborhood centers, where it doesn't really complete.
"Possible additions we will do when all 12,000 forms will be completed," said the municipality's spokesperson, Sebastian Buraga yesterday.
"Scruits no teas" will end on September 25, and if the majority vote of exits is in favour of replanting trees then the mayor will plant your silver in this fall.
The Jesuits can express their opinion at the neighborhood centers of Dacia, Frumoasa, Tâtaraşi, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as at the points mentioned above.
The mayors decided to cut the teas off Stefan the Great in early 2013, which brought a fine of 60,000 lei to the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without a consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civic group "Iașul loves teas", an online community of about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for the replanting of tea was signed by over 9,100 supporters by yesterday evening.
RECORD of students enrolled in USAMV Iasi!
It's 920 in year I
The university has 920 students this year in the year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" pointed out that this year were the most candidates ever admitted, from the history of the institution of higher education, since the establishment.
We are very pleased with the results of this year's admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates in university history, almost 920 students in year I. We never exceeded such a number.
"We also had candidates with higher averages, we occupied the places from the budget to the license and master," said Professor Ioan Ténu, director responsible for teaching activity.
He further stated that the university has also registered a considerable number of students at tax, occupying 20% of those places, a significantly higher figure than in other years.
Although the results were also published on the study lines in Romanian, admission to the English-language study programme at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which brought 50 places to the competition, where the fee is 5,000 euros, and is now expected to be answered by the ministry as regards the confirmation of the students' records and the necessary study visas.
At the autumn session, a total of 120 files were deposited on the 14 budgeted places and 209 were taken to the "tax" competition in the license studies.
Most of the files were filed at the School of Agriculture, 75, in Horticulture were 23, and in Zoothehnie, 22.
At the master's session, 18 dossiers were filed, on the 150 tax seats proposed by USAMV, seven of them in Agriculture, five in Horticulture and six in Zoothehnia.
Drivers are afraid to enter the wheels of the cars in the cracks on the Tudor Vladimirescu Bridge
The bridge over Bahului on the Tudor Vladimirescu Boulevard was as ugly as when the "Jiare of Iasi" wrote about the problems they presented ten days ago.
Our daily reporters then signaled that on the axis that demarcates the two senses of walking asphalt was left, defending deep clusters, some even 20 centimeters, through which concrete plates representing the primary infrastructure of the bridge are seen.
The asphalt also began to crack on one side and on the other side of the axis, predenting signs that the depths will be accentuated.
At that time, the interim mayor Mihai Chirica states that the bridge has no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise, with a view to starting a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tramway, worth 5 million euros.
Mayor Chirica states that the area affected by cracks and pits will be marked, and asphalt restoration works will be carried out quickly.
But the only measures taken so far have been the setting up of epics and signaling bands, without even making a simple lead.
During this period, we focused more on opening the school and the necessary work to that end.
"There is a point-of-the-art expertise that we are waiting for in about a week with the details needed for the intervention, I appreciate that in no more than two weeks we can move on to remedy the situation," the interim mayor said.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stephen, started school.
Preparatory class, how he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know whether to enjoy myself or leave melancholy unspoilt; inclined, passively, to the second variant.
First, because I feel like it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took him for the first time, with emotions, to the garden.
Although it is light, no normal parent is happy to have children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day in my childhood; then began a story that, at the top, was not over until today.
I wasn't even what is usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But the school always liked me.
So much so that I chose to continue to frequent her, even as a teacher.
When I decided that's what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And none with any stake.
That's because, like every one of us, I've given all kinds of teachers: better or worse, nicer or insufferable, smarter or right imbeciles.
It happens, unfortunately, to exist people with other calls in this breeze.
I think they're toxic, because they damage enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I was lucky to give, while I was a student or a student, over a few, few, exceptions.
These meetings can be decisive if they are spent at the right time.
Anyone who believes that the role of the chair is trivial transmission of information is wrong.
This can be done by anyone; by information, the student can be informed very well by himself, that we are only living in the era of transparency.
A good teacher, however, shapes the minds of the students.
It forms them, it spreads their thoughts.
Sitting in the chair is not a privilege, as I think enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very mofturous, demanding, unforgivable and always willing to look for the hives of those in front of them.
That's how they dictate their age, their temperament.
In adolescence, we all thought that we knew everything, that we had certain facts about anything.
When we grow up, we come to understand that we have only doubts.
That's why a teacher's role is to get the adolescent out of his category self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean to start to doubt, ask questions.
To discover on its own the answers, both them and the provisionals.
Get involved in everything he does.
Straighten it to profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially that most of the time the student thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One who barely waits to catch him on the wrong foot to sanction him.
Now, that's what directs him, the pure, uncomprehensible, rebellious, because he has to live out of his old calls, to look at the chair with suspicion.
That he just can't accept his natural attempt to order it.
Teenagers are not allowed to set up, they do not agree to be restricted.
Or, if I give the impression that I do, they get revenge somehow.
And, unfortunately, when there is a rigid person in the chair, who demands hard and doesn't communicate, the students get revenge on the subject.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with great writers, for example, because of the lack of touch of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who feel that history is a set of data, that mathematics is all that can be more tiring for their impotent mind.
I always urge my students: if you give up a teacher you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him remove you from literature to which you should go.
How did it happen that I became the teacher myself?
I had a very good teacher in VI-VIII.
He opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the puber since then on his understanding.
I've met, in high school, a university professor who opened the door to his library.
I was looking at him as a man from another world: he had the walls of the house covered with embroidered shelves of books.
I lost myself in his library and dreamed I had one the same.
Now I may have it, but if I hadn't pulled it out of my way, maybe I would have decided to become a footballer.
Or engineer or lawyer or who else knows what.
I don't think such meetings are random.
I don't believe in Hazard.
Essentially, it is to go over the man who takes you by hand and turn you patiently toward his own vocation.
And this is, most often, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me talk only about what it means to teach literature.
It's just that literature can't be handed over.
There's no literature teacher, just like there's math teacher.
How do you fix the ineffable concepts?
You can at most approach it without pretending to transmit the truth stoned.
The chair can at most guide reading, that's everything else.
But especially may be the occasion of some miraculous encounters, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open her mind, that can lift her up, talk to someone, the blindfolds.
Therefore, the professor of literature must, first of all, succeed in getting his students to understand (feeling) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great seamstress, Al. Paleologu, says one thing only apparently paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not the other way around!" and he was right.
That's why a good lord prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Fortunately, we always have to learn something.
And we, the teachers; or especially us, the teachers.
Most of the time, only a great truth is repeated with inertia: not only did the students learn from their masters, but the opposite.
Ideally, the teacher should be a master, and the student a student a student.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A little bit I find him, that's right.
But the master was the one who lit the spark.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a purely blood teacher than to endure as many separations as possible.

If FIFA extends
Justice in the United States and Switzerland will proceed to new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal prosecutions will begin in the case of new persons and organisations, in the investigation of FIFA corruption, inform the international press.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced, Monday, at a press conference in Zürich, that the area of investigations into global football corruption was enlarged.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will engage in additional criminal prosecutions to new individuals and organizations," Lynch said.
In May, several senior FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extradited to the United States.
"We hope that other people being prosecuted will reach the US," Lynch added.
Switzerland's Attorney General, Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said his institution has seized several goods, including houses and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the investigation carried out in collaboration with the United States.
"We didn't even reach the end of the first stop," Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information has been confiscated, 11 terrabytes.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
The investigators also entered into a media rights concession contract at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a major corruption scandal, after American justice has accused 14 people, including two FIFA Vice Presidents and seven forum officials.
The detained persons are researched for bribes and other benefits, from the early 1990s and until now, totaling more than $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced, in early July, that he resigns from the office of President of FIFA, after being re-elected for the fifth time.
Fight like movies at the theater
In the Supekombat Gala from Milan, the exiter Catalin Moroşanu will fight the "beast" James Wilson
A number of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Catalin Moroşanu, will participate on 2 October at the Superkombat Gala at the Milan Linear 4 Ciak Theatre, the last before the end of November, are shown in a MEDIAFAX release statement.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as we promised, we will return this fall with a new five-star galle.
If we've still chosen an unpublished venue, a theater, then we promise to fight like in the movies.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters in the event schedule.
In addition to the games with the already consecrated stars, we will have another gala in the opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, among which the Romanians Cristi Spetcu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"It will soon be announced and the full program," said promoter Eduard Irimia.
Catalin Moroșanu will fight in the Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination gala with American James Wilson, known after he took part in the last pyramid in the heavy category organized in Japan and numerous awards from the bodybuilding concussions.
I'm just waiting to fight in Italy.
I saw Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm tearing him down!
I'm still upset that last year I couldn't fight in the end, so now I'm going to get revenge on him.
"From the beast transforms it into a kitten," said Moroşanu.
Undefeated in 2015, Andrei and Bogdan Stoica's brothers will have in Italy the last encounters before fighting for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, they both went through KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm glad I'm back in Italy, last year's atmosphere has been incredible.
"I'm just waiting to meet the fans there and promise them a new unforgettable show," said Andrei Stoica.
In Milan he will also fight Raul Catinas with an opponent to be established.
A little girl invited the queen of England to her birthday, but she also fought in her letter
A girl from Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for her longest reign, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to Buckingham Palace when she went to visit him with her family.
The letter was not echoed, but the girl received an answer from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for the invitation, but also apologized that she could not be present on September 27, but even hated her having fun with family and friends.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together to a talkshow shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died of heart disease.
The fate of Adrian Păunescu and Vadim Tudor is similar.
Both of them were writers and politicians, and both of them went out at close ages of heart.
Adrian Păunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died on a TV reality show.
Full of speech, Vadim Tudor ironized Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, Minister of Tourism from that time, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor said to Adrian Păunescu, with a smile on his face, "I'm jealous of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
He said, "It's not too praiseworthy what you're telling me now."
Adrian Păunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died today, 14 September 2015, at the age of 65.
Two Unconscious People After an ACCIDENT in Dumbrava
An accident took place on Monday evening around 7:00 in Dumbrava in Iaşi county.
A biker was taken up by a Volkswagen car.
The cyclist was not noticed by the driver.
Luckily, they're both stable.
Following the impact, the windshield and the mirror of the car were broken.
Two injured people are unconscious at the time of transmission of this news.
A SMURD crew is on its way to give the victims medical assistance and transport them to the hospital.
The cops are on the spot.
A Syrian artist turned "Super Mario" into a refugee
A Syrian artist created a version with refugees of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the plight of his compatriots on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Skulls, the modified video game has in the center of "Mario Refugee".
The character tries to pass by human traffickers and border police, on its way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The artist established in Istanbul uses Samir al-Mufti's pseudonym for security reasons and said that he made the video game with Mario refugee after his friends ventured on a dangerous journey to Europe, to escape the horrors of war.
At the Craiova Detention Center the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Center, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I, and the largest is 25 years old and is in Class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a center belonging to the National Prison Administration to try to draw attention, and thus, to lesser known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in Class I, and the largest is 25 years old and enrolled in Class XI.
"There are complicated subjects that society is concerned to debate at this time, we are all overwhelmed by our own concerns and problems, but we must not overlook the lesson that these over 100 young people in the Craiova Detention Centre offer," said Minister Robert Cazancic on Monday at the school year's opening feast.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that lack of education, motivated in many cases by lack of material possibilities, can lead to tragedy, stating that young people in this centre would have another chance in life if they could have followed the natural school course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to find out what it means to respect the law and what consequences it may have had.
"The role of the penitentiary system is not to permanently isolate people from society who have broken the law, to lock them behind high walls, but to try to recreate them and prepare them, so that when they return back to the community they have more chances of reintegration," Cazanciuc added.
The minister stated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system, because in many cases detention conditions are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and because of this partnership, every year, in the prison system, there are more than 2000 graduates of school education.
Obviously, we won't be able to change overnight that hasn't been done 25 years, but there are important steps we're taking.
"In all these steps we also need company support, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and are not a danger to society," said Cazanciuc.
The Minister of Justice has hated the success of both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the conjugated effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the exaltation of the Holy Cross, I would launch all students and teachers the invitation to visit the mausoleums of Soveja, Maărăsti and not only, to understand what it means to young people's fight for ideals," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to vote with a bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be disbanded!
Petition of prestigious university students in Iași and the country
Over 200 researchers, university frameworks, personalities and students in the country have signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academic Society requesting the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even defuse the Romanian doctoral schools "allowing and promoting academic taxation".
Among the signatories of the petition launched on 10 September are the teaching frameworks and teachers in Iași.
Among the university signatories to the petition in the academic environment is, for example, Prof.Dr. Liviu Antonesei.
At national level, the petition has names from former ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miclea, to people of culture who are also university teaching frameworks, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Education Act provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been achieved so far, thus determining the lack of specific sanctions for doctoral schools that flagrantly violate ethical rules of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance," the petition states.
That petition specifically calls for compliance with the National Education Act, evaluation of doctoral schools, suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school in which more than two plagiarisms were found, until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school where there is no minimum number of doctoral conductors provided for by the law to meet the criteria required by the National Scientific Research Council in 2011 for eligibility for grants for IDEI projects.
Do you less respect a general without a doctorate, or a politician, or an intelligence agent in the Middle East?
"Why does there not exist in Europe other academies that give doctorates organized by secret services, and top soldiers that give their doctorate do it to autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academy Society, who initiated the petition, also originating in Iasi.
This can be completed by all applicants on the Society's Internet page, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organization to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "For Iaşi" party, founded by young unaffiliated IT managers, was launched yesterday in Copou Park.
The president of the "For Iași" Initiative Group gave an interview on the "Day of Iaşi"
The Iașu will have a party dedicated exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of non-political entrepreneurs and managers so far launched at the end of last week the Party for the Iași organization that will propose candidates to the local elections in 2016.
Currently, the party's core is made up of IT specialists, but the team's initiators say that in the organization all people who want to get involved in modernizing the city are welcome.
The launch took place Saturday, in Copou Park, and at the event more than 200 sympathizers, almost all being young.
The special guest of the action was Nicușor Dan, president of the Save Bucharest Association.
He was the surprise of the 2012 local elections when, from the independent position, he managed to gather 10% of the votes of the joys for the mayor of the Capital.
"The people I've seen at "For Iaşi" I think they're very good at accessing Iaşi's public administration."
I believe in this initiative, I think it has chances, I think it can have more chances in a community smaller than that in Bucharest.
"I'll always be with "For Iaşi," said Nicușor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iasi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are more sentimental and emotional.
I've been away in many short business trips, I've also lived a year in Cluj.
I came back every time, because I felt like this was my house.
ZDI: Why have you decided now to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache:Now we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have begun to know each other for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we became more timid, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various construction or charitable actions, and, somehow, things have evolved naturally and organicly and now it has happened when we came to the decision that we have to involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects for the efficiency of local public administration activity!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of minimal information of the city's activities so that different departments, institutions and regions cooperate as well.
But, more importantly, they can publish transparent data on activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects etc. We are talking about information organisation.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular neighborhood, it is important to consult the affected people publicly.
If we talk about efficiency, we must not forget the transport in common, we have the worst buses in the country.
New means of transport must be bought.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city matters extremely much.
How would you promote the Jașul?
Andrei Postolache:You get on the plane and you're looking for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do this and know how to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iaşi.
What's the Iaş's brand?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we have to be a city of technology in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we need to expand it, go to medicine, enter the robotics area, the 3D printing area, continue in this spirit and unite such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I mean here to the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Iasul already has a historical brand that must not change, namely the cultural city.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for lack of experience in public administration as well as the lack of traditional party structures with which elections are still being won in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: The administration is a form of management, which means organization, planning, communication, working with people and running projects.
We have management experience.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we won't just stay on Facebook, we're not online party.
We don't want to have "voluntary" brought with the bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there are enough people like that.
ZDI: Should Iaş mayor be more concerned about promoting the image of the city at national and international level, or is it necessary for the area of concern to be permanently edilitary?
Andrei Postolache: One without another does not work.
First of all, you have to solve today's problems, the emergencies.
Now, if you don't make your town known, if you don't attract money into the city, at some point you're running out of money and you won't be able to do, for example, streets.
Both must be done at the same time and must be competent men next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the model of the mayor-patu, who comes and knocks with his fist in the table and solves everything.
No. No.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something right, have a bad reputation, be clear integrity and be honorable.
From this point of view, we have no other filter.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, the Introspecials company was set up after, for seven years, he was director of the Endava International concern (2008 - 2015), where he coordinated a team of 300 people.
Another four years (2003 - 2007) spent at Synygy.
The company that set up with another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
The Rabla tractor program proved to be a failure
The Director General of SC Irum SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said that the program to stimulate the renewal of the national tractor and agricultural machinery park, initiated in 2011, also known as Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to bureaucracy.
Linked to the Rabla Programme, there have been some trials in recent years, but it has proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a common farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
Through that program it was able to sell somewhere at 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltean said.
According to it, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that the high competition is exercised by companies abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It's a very high competition with those coming from outside, all the world's producers have set their eyes on Romania, I know these things I told you, and they have special policies.
"At all fairs there is big agglomeration, all producers exhibit, come with all kinds of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who said that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
By the program Rabla for tractors, initiated in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as the combinations, could surrender and instead receive a voucher of 17,000 lei.
The red flag has been lifted
The internal election of workers seems to be more spectacular and more politically significant, as the new leader chosen becomes his head of launch automatically in future elections.
Raised, therefore, the red-burned flag/ Under his skirts we will live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn sang yesterday in the London Sanctuary House pub.
He's been testifying to many facts and vows. Let's not change his color now.
Readers who don't know the song line of this unofficial British and international left (Red Flag/The Red Flag) could search the Internet and would not be excluded from being part of a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's all swear that we'll wear it until we fall.
The author of these lines is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and not those that float them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn manages to join the left yesterday with the one tomorrow, this love story between him and the Labour Party base will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think it will happen that way, but it seems to me premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat, over five years, of a leader chosen yesterday.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have witnessed a democratic exercise of an impressive scope.
The British workers did not invent the voting system directly for the party leader, on the western left.
French Socialists have been practicing for a few years a more complicated system, based on motions, which allows the expression of all members and supporters; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for the appointment of the candidate to the presidential in 2012.
However, the internal election of workers seems to be more spectacular and more politically significant, as the new leader chosen automatically becomes his head of launch in future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of political system, personalizing power being more pronounced in Britain than the other side of the Channel of the Hand.
In addition, participation in the vote was high in all three "circulations": members themselves, members of trade unions and other organisations affiliated to the party and finally the group of supporters (who received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This last group gives us interesting information about the perceptions of the left segments of British society, especially those made up of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to involve themselves even more, in the future, just because of Corbyn's signal of victory.
There are, as far as I know, sociological investigations that tell us too much about the attitudes of this "outer circle" laborist, so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we encounter a lot of attitudes similar to those of sympathizers Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will travel through the traditional channels of the left.
If we have to identify a "anti-system" vocation, it is primarily reflected by rejecting the centrist line, New Labour (for many, just a dissimulated form of much-hulite thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty by the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go left enough, that they did not demarcate firmly from the Tony Blair era.
The second - and more suggestive - landmark is offered by the recent referendum on independence of Scotland.
If we are abstracting from the separatist message and are focusing strictly on aspirations regarding other political themes, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of social-friendly public segments animated by the aspiration of equity, followers of disarmament and hostile military involvement across borders, but also sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
Scottish workers have thus lost an electorate to which they should have, at least in principle, privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbyn’s campaign).
Such energy exists everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chance of success than Ed Miliband, the laborer's "aristocrat".
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the one with the left antisym from the southern periphery of Europe.
The term "anti-system" is too harsh: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
Until next week we'll learn more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as leader of the opposition.
We'll see if the red flag will rise in the House of Commons (it won't be for the first time), after the new leader will be taken over, first of all the opposition banks.
However, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is primarily unity - and in this regard he even has reason to be concerned.
Capacities for handling with or without good science
While I wrote the article went through my head to check the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated to V. Marin's person "Laith Al-Saleh jihadist" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in themselves make me from the circumspect start).
I didn't.
In the article last week (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") we commented in parallel two pictures - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean shore and the one, in fact: the two depicting the Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh took it from the article "Syrian Fighters Coming With the Wave of Refugees" (signified by Viorica Marin in the Truth of September 3).
Monday evening, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, I found, among other things, a sleeve shot from the friend (not just the FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscription, except a precision. Laith of Saleh is not jihadist".
On the contrary, he's a fighter against Al Assad, for democracy and those.
"So you could add and manipulate thick in the painting!"
I have to admit, I felt bad.
Even more so as as I wrote the article went through my head to check the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated to V. Marin's person "the Laith Al-Saleh jihadist" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in themselves make me from the circumspect start).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
On the spot, then I had no other comment on Marius Cristian's hand-shooting than that: "I need it if I (had) trust in the Truth"
After that, I obviously took the story for small money and I feel indebted to readers with the correct presentation of the story of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest one we found in a material by the Associated Press (Syrian rebel leader Seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader is looking for Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where they noticed, among hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man trying to order in the chaos of many.
The man was Syrian tutor Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who "is used to being in command", since "he led a unit of 700 rebels in the Syrian civil war".
We also know that Al Saleh, aged 30, had "a home, a wife and a normal life before he started the fight that cost over 250,000 lives and put on the roads a third of the Syrian population".
In the interview with Associated Press Correspondents, Al Saleh tells that "everybody wants to leave Syria."
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (a extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me to fight everyone.
Besides being kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a more sinister meeting - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Now two days, I saw a sniper in government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very upset.
From the material we also know that Laith (which means lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to Holland, where he has a cousin - he was a senior officer in the Syrian army and then he also became rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and then be able to bring his family - his wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly an age with the Syrian civil war, which broke out in March 2011).
After this was accomplished, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue the fight for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by Russians), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated Al-Qaeda.
A madman - who wants freedom must fight in Syria not only one enemy but three!
I've been across a Serbian material since 22 August, of which I have not understood much, just that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come with migrants: TERRISTI SE KRIJU ME.U MIGRANTIMA calls the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/veste, in which a photo of Al Saleh with beards holding a Syrian flag in his hand and the one of the refugees in which he wears the THANK YOU shirt.
On September 7, then, himself on the BBC site, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation using photos with the Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely claims to show an IS figter posting as a refuge - This viral photo claims to be a fighter of the Islamic State setting in the refugee.
We find that the picture (in fact: the pictures - with Laith with beard and gun and the THANK YOU shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would use and apologize in the meantime.
Only before that, only on his wall, the image with both pictures would have been taken more than 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That word, too late, the horse had gone!
In Romania, on 9 September Carla Dinu from Hotnews took over the story with the BBC manipulation, however, translating the title: "A fake photograph became viral looks like an ISIS fighter giving himself as a refugee".
Obviously, the photograph is not false, but the interpretation was a false, wrong, short: manipulative.
