At the end of the trade, the Prague stock exchange in the negative
After Tuesday morning's fall, Prague's scholarship rectifies its losses.
Transactions with the ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague stock exchange renewed with its fall from the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the fall is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the House of American representatives, which refused to adopt the American financial sector stabilization plan, is also noticeable in our home.
Action Drop in Asia
The Asian scholarships experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the indices succeeded, during the day, in eradicating some of the losses.
Hang Seng's Hong Kong Stock Exchange index lost four percent during the trade, but later, it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decrease to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Sing China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock movements of the Hongkong Stock Exchange lost 3.8%, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually we managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6%.
"The hesitation about rescue action in the USA will affect the financial markets around the world," observes Joseph Yam, the head of the Hongkong monetary office.
Although Hongkong is part of China, he establishes his own monetary policy, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries might be affected.
The bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the House of American Representatives rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (near 12 billion Kč).
The legislators thus waived the call for the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
U.S. actions have experienced, on Monday, a bloodbath and the main indices of actions have seen the biggest fall in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven per cent, having experienced a fall of such a size for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it fell free.
Congress ceda: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial assistance to the American financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
The U.S. legislators made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid amounting to $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns), granted to the US financial system.
Success is not certain.
Indeed, before the final version of the Act can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be reviewed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Reuters Barney Frank, chairman of the Board's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, the plan should be submitted to the Senate by Wednesday at the earliest possible date.
Economists say that the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor to re-establish financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form in which the package of market stabilization measures should take," she told the Bloomberg Agency to democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to her, the final vote could be taken on Sunday.
On Saturday night to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with the U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson in order to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It should purchase from financial companies the unsaleable real estate assets that cause financial companies to suffer considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to pursue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on falling stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, Harry Reid was not escaping, the legislators made the Congress a final agreement on Sunday.
They thus wish to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress's decision could influence Monday's trade.
For the moment, however, it is impossible to state with certainty when the two Houses of the U.S. Congress will proceed to the vote, or if negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by such a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, there will be a number of amendments to the law.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if Congress feels that the program does not perform its function, it has the opportunity to block the remaining amount, following two steps: first, $100 billion extra, then, to finish, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may put his veto on this decision, Congress has the opportunity to make him a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, including the low value, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All work is done.
The House of Representatives should be in a position to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of Golden Parachutes
The Chair of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the deductive agreement, the progress of the plan on the axis of time.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of these golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides support for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new bills in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological Aid
According to the economic leader of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we don't know what will be the mechanism and the price of the purchase of the problem assets.
This point will be decisive in determining the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week at the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, is not, according to Marek, so important.
"It is far more important that congressmen agree, from this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," stresses Marek.
A hard fight at the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent sufficient reasons for obtaining an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive gramophone to place the new album of Maxim Turbonc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are stacked vinyl discs in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you're probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, namely compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, just like a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time supporting listeners purchased for twenty crowns in the market.
These are two extremes, among which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of batteries is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than simply reading music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, phone calls and SMS sending, it is able to read music and movies, record them, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take Smartphones and communicators into account, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge knows how to grill meat and no TV will take photographs, we are almost witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantage.
The larger the number of functions you use, the more the interval between two charges will be reduced.
And music reading is one of the most important energy goinfles.
Mobiles that are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours are rare, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are much more performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, expect that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you get to call from time to time, find, to be sure, a second charge for the job - this being even valid for the more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players who are capable of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing ones.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a USB universal connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
You can of course record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know to take it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobiles.
With regard to readers, you do not need any software except (iPod).
Just fill in, via the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers themselves will create a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the album title, style, or according to the judgment of the user.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, in the way to explore Windows, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a concrete device, be particularly interested in the life of the accumulator, the capacity of memory, the quality and the type of output of sound and, of course, the ease of order.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if you are going to listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading MP3.
Practically all the furniture is now capable of it.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to music formats that mobile or player is able to read.
All come to read the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you right this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also read WMA music.
The AAC (format used by the Apple firm and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Simply visit the corresponding operator's (or other supplier's) web pages from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason to obtain a musical mobile.
The operators' offer is unfortunately miserable and, in most cases, it is limited to fast-made tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, the Internet or even the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their mobile on their own.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have listeners or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in enclosures, which have virtually all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The least expensive normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand crowns, we can have a walkman already very suitable.
In most cases, however, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also equipped with an input for ordinary listeners, does not exceed 15 thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really anyone who manages to ensure the order of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive ones (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is evident.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a random connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have an exchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models generally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive get out even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy a cheap MP3 player again, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or a iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are among the most demanding auditors, choose specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and so the ease of the command is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the further in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the marks mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win Czechia this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czechia is relatively advanced, our operators offering almost the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force classic operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for long.
We have already mentioned, many times, on Mobil.cz, the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
ČTú (The Czech Telecommunications Office), who reported that the price of an SMS was higher at home than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, following the recent steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming fee regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of cheaper Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Czechia remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that goes far beyond 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú), who declared several times that there was no room in Chechnya for another operator, made chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network seems to have no more chance (in fact, now he would find only hard frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable decrease in prices, to which classical operators should then also react.
Yet, even before the entry of the riots such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those heard today at home would be heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to earn over 100 thousand customers and become the country's fifth operator.
Let us add that behind Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which has among other things the U:fon in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be effective, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, free from relatively high construction, operation and maintenance costs of the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators look like low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offer.
For example Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least twice as expensive in Britain as its competitors.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, placing on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity.
Indeed, this operator specifically aims at men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is hard to say, if such a concept would be likely to work with us too.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesperson, doubting: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
All the more so as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In Czechia, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czechia, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but in Chechnya negotiations are not very supportive.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," said in a telephone entertainment for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that Czech operators were not in any case in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible so that a potential competitor can not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, does not hide, for quite a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We have a lot to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services but also mobile.
And the sooner it's gonna be the best.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have been able to move forward in the negotiations," said the spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
The future may therefore be promising.
According to informal information, it seems that we could perhaps welcome the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by a total silence.
"At the moment, we do not think there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific ones.
At the moment, no topic with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vladimil Sršeň of the Press Department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobilea Kemrová's spokesperson states in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not registered for the moment a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs its attention to the fulfilment of requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said in this regard: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and above all in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means the most input from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
Mobile operators' approach is easily understandable, another operator's entry would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profit.
So, what good is it to facilitate the arrival of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to feel like a larron in the fair. The Chicane accompanying the creation of the U:phone also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on ČTU, at the creation of the U:fon, was the one exercised by T-Mobile.
This shows information that is accessible to the public from the ČTú web pages.
Today, however, the U:fon lends itself as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this connection: "The competition on the mobile market has been, moreover, recently enlarged by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and above all its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of mobile operators here, the indifference of Czech regulators seems to be disconcerting.
However, it is not only the attitude of Čtú, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in the economic competition in Czechia.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopts, in response to this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded for the time being, since the offer of potential stakeholders has not a priori presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa in response to our question from the UOHS external relations department.
A declaration thus made would not surprise operators' representatives.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and also care, so that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a declaration is more than misleading.
Even more so than Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the sense of honest market operation and a lower price does not appear to be part of the interests of the UOHS.
What is really shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a chance, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is likely to be due to random and hard competition.
"The Office has not identified signs of anticompetitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore none of them have an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the telecommunications regulator," said Chaloupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTU, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts propose another view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator quite logically has the monopoly on his network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the UOHS that three mobile operators are performing in a similar manner.
However, complaints from many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned), show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
To resume responsibility for the ČTU is a fairly common tour of communications, through which the UOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to introduce the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, an extension of ČTú's powers in the field of competition in telecommunications, although many specialists were promising to improve the situation.
However, the representatives of the UOHS must know very well, but their interests seem to be elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
That said, the operation of some sort of virtual pseudo-operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unclear.
These are companies publishing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but they are only partially public.
In most cases, companies dealing with multi-level marketing are involved.
Specialized mobile telephone services are provided, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms are generally only available to elected officials.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company does in front of the operator is a classic business client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important client, she gets special price offers (and others).
What is a problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If what you think happened, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and which could result in a cessation of cooperation with the society in question," replied our question regarding this Martina Kemrová problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not been achieved until those responsible for mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of clients.
However, no operator can take a decision against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these companies bring them non-negligible benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to actual virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card on their phones is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
This is precisely what should seem strange to Čtú.
In addition, another question is asked to the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to reveal such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the operators' explanations, which claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions forbidding it.
When we will no longer be the most expensive country
As we have mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has resulted in a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, virtually in all the countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators were trying, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that regulatory bodies in the developed countries intervened, which were defending not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and through informal pressure, they ended up obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are dealing with this issue as a hot potato that is being disposed of by transmitting it to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in the skills is more profitable to them.
But don't throw the sleeve after the cognane.
If the flow information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may be moving back.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will be unable to remain impassable in the face of the rejection (to discrimination) of others concerned.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech nationality day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde kasov m.j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was once again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with heart and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jérémieáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek views Czech national singing as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good saying, so that one could understand the words, which they sang simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate, next year, its 175th anniversary.
The song Kde kasov m a.m.j for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of the States) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des sapétiers), the Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously made it appropriate.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
He remained one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the Hymne "new" sounds
Common transport (MHD) will introduce chips into their ticket system on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be included in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragoise Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the subway, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
Currently, it is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day coupon or 90-day coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it recorded on their chips card in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transportation Agency), located in the Metro Stations Museum, MČetek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday onwards, there is also the possibility to purchase coupons via the Internet on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who will begin to use the online store can permanently forget the windows in the metro stations, where they so far have to tread impatience in long queues in order to obtain paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon online and will record it on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is at the disposal of passengers a window with trained staff, which will help those interested with the purchase via the Internet and will also record the coupon they bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Alongside libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recall the machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the Roztyly Metro Stations, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be ninety," Opatrný added.
A machine will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will run from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city.
In the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the municipalities of the Central Bohème to access the capital.
"On the trains integrated to Pražská integrovaná doprava (Integrated Transport of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of coupons;" explained the control of the Filip Drápal tickets of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of transport in common pragois.
Periurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated with the driver's box.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered coupons.
"If the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," added Drápal.
Passengers who do not take out the peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which their coupon expires, may rejoin automatic distributors, initially used to record coupons on the card.
This is where the information on the validity of their document will be displayed on the device screen.
The Sudets called for a referendum in the USA
The Germans of the South asked in 1945 for Šumava to be integrated in the United States.
This is the result of a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (Scientific Library of the Bohème du Sud).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Germans of the Sudetes allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This derives from, among other things, a preserved letter in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans of Český Krumlov in the letter ask the American President not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of the Bohemian region) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation very well and we want to be sure that the words proclaim that American troops come into German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, "People, whose fate of Šumava stands out."
Given that the rally in Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, reckless attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take into his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe, that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, that oppresses and destroys minorities and that has not at all contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the fourth million inhabitants," the letter says.
The alleged reason the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech Oppressors".
If the President of the USA doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, in view of the current knowledge of the history of the post-war war, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudets of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least find out that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them had such an opportunity.
Some were expecting the United States and Great Britain to obtain a certain type of autonomy for the South.
Others thought they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, it was, as German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war thought that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the Republic.
Don’t think about it!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way of characterizing the emotional media campaign that is intended to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Aleš .ebíček's office believes that it will discourage drivers from flying dangerous behaviour.
This campaign costs 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving quickly and from driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before it starts.
Above all, she wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also testifies to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don’t think about it!
The phrase "You do not think" is entered in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a flash of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay for life a moment of attention.
The spots will "hanter" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with dramatic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will result in a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whipping against drivers
"What works with drivers is the system of sugar and whipping.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grate a red fire.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to drivers," said Martin Kořán, the transportation psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, says the psychologist.
Panels reporting the danger to drivers are, in his view, already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and the drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would render in exchange for peace almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Provisional Government, supported the restoration of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), even all of them," Olmert said on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be done," he added.
He admitted that possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," said Olmert, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, when several people were killed and dozens wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historic places" located within the Old City.
"Those who wish to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he said later.
Withdrawal of the Golan Heights
Olmert also voted in favour of Israel's retirement from the Golan Heights, which he believed was an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retirement from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Chile Movement); they will have to give up their constant support for Hamas (Chile Movement), Al-Kaïda (Terrorist Network), as well as that of Djihad (Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are Stewards illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arose whether hikers and passengers could travel within the bus.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a stalker is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said the spokesman of the Department of Transportation Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostesse died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus path.
The girl was at this moment unfortunately sitting next to the driver, at the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had at her disposal two other seats.
However, the bus can have an accident or even brake abruptly, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical form equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing space equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue that we dealt with with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits any passenger movement.
Then they cancelled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the trip provided they have their own seat," he unveiled his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the role of Steward - no legal requirement deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Hanzelka's spokesman with greater ambiguity.
Josef Pokorný, the Director of the Road Traffic Department, believes, on the contrary, that the law deals sufficiently with the problem.
"Everything depends on the fact that the bus has in its approval permission to offer standing seats.
It's all in there," he says.
Buses are divided into urban spaces, where there are standing spaces and a limited maximum speed, intermediate with standing spaces and higher authorized speed and in long-distance buses without standing with the maximum permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert at BESIP (safety of road traffic) in transport, does not see the displacement of the yards on board as a major problem.
"During regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service on planes.
There, too, it's not sure when there will be a turbulence and the air hostess can melt its head."
"Or, in the event that the bus would have stopped abruptly, the laws of physics would of course be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the security of the yards by internal requirements," he said, and also felt that from the point of view of the law, the problem was not resolved.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer Stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider his or her business a venture.
"However, as soon as I feel like it's a risky job, I'll delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
This would also reduce the costs," he said.
Security concerns are the reason given for the absence of yards in its vehicles by Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We have no hosts. We have opposed them since the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has come
A young hostess in the Plzeň region, who had been working for society for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a flash and blocked the road at the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he rubbed it on his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the yards were sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the young girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it also relies on the offender.
An amendment to the Act?
Not in sight
An amendment to the Act, which has been being developed for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the travel of the train yards on board the bus.
"Or, she did not reach any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she does not care too much about buses, but rather about the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile device on the wheel," said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activity of the yards as something that would fundamentally endanger passenger safety," concludes the spokesperson Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldoris are based on Frankfurt.
The main words did not fail in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the household employees.
From a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institute with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could be established, according to the letter made public on Monday.
WestLB would bring a double "block of competence" of sustainable productivity in such a case.
In short, such a relationship could be a decisive move towards other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee tries to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, injured, is still under strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which has, only recently, made it clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, it has been a matter for some time now - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of any form between the Deka bank, who knows the Sparkasse customers by their investment funds, and WestLB.
Indeed, the Chief of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas announced at the presentation of the figures from the late August six months that he saw no meaning in the merger of Mainzer Landstrasse's house with a bank in Land, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported and by the banks of the Länder and by the groups of savings banks, commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have just begun, we say in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, together with its 3000 employees, counts for one of the most important employers on the financial place in Frankfurt, comes into play on the issue of consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a time that the Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of the Land of Palatinat and the Halbab.
Nothing, however, came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had barely been made public that the Government of the Land of Hesse had decided against any involvement of Hellaba in them.
Afterwards, neither the other two houses met.
The bank of the Land of Rhénie Palatinat was placed in place at the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new talks on the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had, however, taken action against any commercial strategy to merge with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to spread that the grouping of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Land Parliament has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bade-Wuttenberg Land Bank could come true at first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure on new mergers was to increase, potential partners would gradually escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
Hesse-Thuringe's savings and transfers, which has 85 percent of Helaba's capital, have, on the other hand, pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NorthLB would remain strict.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, namely, through which commercial model the future capacity of the banks of the Länder should be assured, had not so far been resolved by the German group of savings and transfers.
In the end, a split of the WestLb could take place, a split which is obviously not desired here.
This is also discussed in the letter from the governing committee in place: in any event, a 'global solution' for the establishment would be envisaged.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer party is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a little friend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a ton of five liters of beer from the Kaiser brand, there is a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors from the beer festival what deep sounds its dog can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kiss her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the road station near the Puorta nouveau station, four buses take departure tonight at 23h45, 'destination Monaco, party della beer', expected arrival at 6h30.
Three buses are primarily reserved for Italians, on one of the buses travelling Brazilians exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which wears a long double coat of false fur and large silver-mounted glasses.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, three shots already just this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 22:30.
spending the night would entail unnecessary costs, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German speaking group manager - Marco taught a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive at night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
This is better, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates are again taking a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When early in the morning, the Marco group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking lot near the Thérèse square, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First: cook off the little yellow cap.
On it is written on the left `Beer Party', in Gothic, and next to the Internet address of the travel agency of Marco `cogniscisaviaggiando.it".
Second: `When the doors of the beer chapter open, it is short', screams Marco in the morning.
`Courir!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
`Not in front, but we block, and not all yellow helmets on the same benches, we must distribute them in the room!'
The chop, raise Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the order!
"Show the security agents that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `This evening, come back here at ten and a half hours!' Got it?
And that's it, it went to the beer party.
On the way, someone new from yellow tree helmets to find the way, panels and even an election poster from a large Bavarian popular party.
We tend to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer party, known as the 'week-end of Italians'.
There are no specific figures; 50 000 are spoken of starting through the Alps and falling into the beer stand, 10 percent of visitors would come from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police is reinforced by seven Southern Tyrolan police officers, by Italian voluntary rescuers who support the Bavarian red cross that makes a statistic on the countries where Italians occupy first place before the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia nights for shareholders of Hippo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician would use the word 'relatively' and he would slip that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This happened this weekend.
The capital of the Bavarian real estate Hippo Real Estate (HRE), next to the DAX, obtains a German bank consortium credit of one billion to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid appropriations are issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hippo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private banks and public-law banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughter company supports the losses.
The state finances had, according to a newspaper article, been refinanced in the short term for long-term projects for which they had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the own capital rate also had slightly decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period the previous year, falling to zero, the profits from the allocation of debt and determined securities and the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only because of the significant benefits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit in earnings of about 16 percent has been moderated.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state finance had initially poorly speculated on real estate industrial credits, which had subsequently been affiliated to the Aarail bank.
Because conventional state funding was not profitable enough, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the child company, the Hippo Real Estate must carry out depreciations that should have on the calculation of the Group's gains and losses an essential material effect that still remains fairly unclear.
The fact is the dividends were amputated.
By 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds.
Since the purchase of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important investor in state and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on interbank refinancing since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks has again considerably tari, the banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual part - about 50 billion euros - of all Depfa's credits of a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a Hypo Real Estate communiqué, the group's need for funding is covered by medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of widely out-of-date international financial markets.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through funds up to the end of 2009.
The Chair of the HRE Georg Funke Steering Committee explained, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer use medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Monitoring Institution (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Royal Hypo Group on the market is now ensured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors only have to hope for it.
However, in view of the dynamics and the taxation of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Furthermore, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used throughout its scope.
But neither can the opposite be dismissed.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the last releases, still at the doors of insolvency on Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least interim will not succeed in reassureing the spirits either.
The course of action fell from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The course of obligations, however, is particularly good.
While the debts in the first head have hardly moved, the second-plan loan courses are slowing.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo and those of course living beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hippo Real Estate Bank previously appeared to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the settlement by the repurchase of the Depfa bank.
As long as the emission institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that there will be a resorption of stalls over time.
Or it will happen what no one can expect at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability approaching certainty has now become a simple founded hope.
This should reserve insomnia nights primarily for long-term creditors on whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a trait to provide a postponement of the losses for the next years on the next tax on the income of automatically withdrawn stock gain capital.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, must meet for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of course in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already on my way to school, I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
I have to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't lose.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be as strict as in Lower Saxony.
Students appear after each other from eight hours, until at nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not in the mood to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I had not yet had the school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my mother-in-home, as well as a shirt, blue up socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, therefore, I came to the desk, and tried to pronounce it correctly: 'Sayonara Wo She Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low Masses, poofed with laughter and signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him through my sleeves.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese adodos and means "mignon, chou".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone spoke to who was better, laughed and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My mother-in-home had also done this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something else than the miserable German in-houses.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, con cucumber salad and algae, fruits and some sort of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
All right, except maybe the salty plums confessed, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl may offer a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope that she will be able to make a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read that in my sleeves.
I'm curious if I can see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
At the end of the day, reading mangoes, that's what I've been preferring for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at one point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, habits and habits.
And here they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a safe escape in the face of danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he has the same experience when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else so far could prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains present the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or in general consciousness, we enter difficult terrains because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he does death, escape or attack.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduct a comparable subjective life.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our life subjective to that of the animals difficult.
One aspect is that circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and management and enforcement functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be entirely absent in other beings.
All the less, therefore, for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from the other primates.
Another significant particularity could reside in the linguistic nature of the Man: a large part of his existence being related to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness was not to depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ a lot from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what awareness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, as a result of this particular Hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses major problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious life, but there is another aspect of the consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal awareness processes could be examined without regard to their content, and that is exactly what happened in short-term memory studies of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in achieving the visualization.
But what happens then to emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we describe as "serious" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its suites, such as the reactions of the body) takes hold of living memory.
As observed, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions that characterize primates and especially the Man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to charge them to others than to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities are born in the areas of cortex body sensation and brain stem, as is Jaak Pankseep, which however focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could fully participate in cross-sectional sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it undemonstrated.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in men and rats is likely to be as felt in both cases: however, how can we verify if rats and males feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
A safe escape from danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviours are not enough to prove identical vecus.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, cockroaches on the other hand do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the source of sensations?
And even if we could prove this for Man: how could we prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely to differ completely from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress has been made to the nervous level as the same is perceived in rats and humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could think of this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly springing up against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, European championships," Wasjunik announced.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the calendar of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA keeps looking at us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The commission met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP press agency.
"We assured the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been convicted of mandatory relegation handling in the previous season; ultimately, the beginning of the League has even been delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid Indignant Against Attack
She wanted to make promotion for a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her former adulterin Dennis Quaid.
He's ecumenical - and counter-attack.
A late Rose war for former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in a disgruntling battle - in the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the failure of marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - told the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his qualification as an unfaithful husband clearly fell down: it would be "monstrous," he said to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg will once again heal the history of our relationship and manipulate it."
It would be even more "reproachable", that "the penalty and disturbances that involve a divorce for each child will be renewed in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
Thus was his answer to the crack: "In any case, my life continues.
I am happy to have a wonderful family that works best."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Hotel flights and nights would have benefited again - this is the result of a study by the provider of American Express financial services and travel.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, established a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by 6.9 per cent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this were for American Express in the low dollar course that led to a "desir of lower travel by American tourists".
Financial positions such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by lower hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand with an increase of 26.3%, the record in Europe.
In terms of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economic class have an average of 7.1 per cent higher than in 2007, long-air flights, very fuel consumers, have even increased to 29.2 per cent.
Between April and June, the prices of the tickets in the economic class dropped by 12.5 per cent on average compared with the previous quarter, in the business class and in the first class, however, the price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they dropped by 23.6 per cent.
The German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this drop in prices would be, on the one hand, slow economic growth, explains the firm.
The demand would fall from the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the Open Sky Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of non-rentable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find an 11 functional.
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will only be late in the game and his shot up failed against the frame of the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," siffla Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg arena's dressing room.
It wasn't much going on in the dressing room, the half-time was over, and most of them were satisfied in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, he has a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at strategic locations.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
The orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The implementation has failed.
"Everything wasn't very nice to see today," said Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "sweetness also be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 in the mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a hit of the head that Mladen Petri (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak gladbach players could not hurt the low players in Hamburg.
"That was a dirty victory," said Marin Jol.
Hamburg's SV will celebrate this Monday its 121 years.
By Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take back," said Marcell Jansen.
It is likely that the intermediate outcome of the table reflects more the unpredictable nature of the First League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late-engaged arrivals - Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petri, as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern - is formed slowly, but it does not yet shine.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol said.
After the vote was failed
At Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the rescue plan failure dropped the Dow Jones temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
By 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock exchange index was 10,579 points with a decline of well five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Fellowship Index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most losers at Dow Jones were at this American Express date who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could bring any benefits anymore.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares accused a drop of almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called damaged mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid once but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should recover options on the actions of the financial company that may be exchanged in relation to the evolution of the course in order to reduce its burden on the Public Treasury.
Courses of action aspirated in Europe and the United States
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not address investors' concerns.
The course of the action of the large German bank Hippo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.

Investors feared that the US Government's $700 Billion heavy rescue plan could not be sufficient to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate should follow on 1 October.

From dark matter influences the theft of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying into space.
Because of soon frozen fuel pipelines, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been the cause of development among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, just like the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave at 100 percent of the way it is expected according to venerable gravitation laws.
In addition, irregularities occur at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him as an anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction of matter due to the curve of space, might not be entirely correct.
U.S. physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always believes that Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support by what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also located near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter for only about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released, as confirmed by the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese raiders had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for ransom would already be initiated.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnapper piler.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what Egypt's state television, the Arab Al-Arabija television channel and the Italian media shared.
Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the newsletters of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians and their eight Egyptian escorts are well and safe, announced Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants in the wilderness should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of hostages remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without screaming station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the officer.
There was nothing left but gathering hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had shot down on Sunday six of the raiders in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them.
The hostage takers had demanded a ransom of €6 million from Germany; the money had to be handed over by the German woman from one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the liberation of hostages took time because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the raiders wanted to free women's hostages after the ransom payment.
The men were to be held until the raiders found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law who leads to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse by his father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stithians, in the Cornouails, was imprisoned for six years after he admitted eight counts of charges for improper conduct.
The Truro High Court referred to his daughter-in-law Stéphanie Randle as a regular link during her childhood from 5 to 7 years of age.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise had attached her to and banned her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornouails.
His daughter-in-law left at Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer assailant of National Trust, was haunted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had reported that Miss Randle, who was a good surfer and a cyclist, had appeared since 2006 "emotionally dead", and "lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the beautiful father of his daughter who had, moreover, written a letter of confession that ended: "I regularly attached her and bandis her."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn't done this thing, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "I particularly stress, as his father and mother describe him, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stéphanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Departmental Officer who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train will be sentenced by the Official Secrets Act to the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading to Waterloo.
Documents came into the hands of the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
That is the least serious conviction of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguard of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services
His missing documents contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies against B&B invoice.
British building companies could have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savings.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies collecting savings money, including 59 buildings.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it is "irritant" to know that companies and their members will have to pay broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be reimbursed when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time will be owed annually to the 700 financial companies that harvest deposits .
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is annoying to see that the institutions that have been careful... now have to pay some of the invoices of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is claimed that each company must pay a proportional amount to its deposits, and that intermediate companies must pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest of the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Building Corporations Trade Committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair.
It is "irritating" to see that the institutions that have been careful in the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for the much less prudent institutions.
According to BSA, no company has failed since 1945, date of the first years.
"we need to examine all aspects of this case for the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent the companies of the building and their members paying this bill out of cash," said Mr. Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year will have to be paid, which could be doubled.
Since the buildings are non-equity organizations, their members end up paying the invoice either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennies per litre
Jerseyers need to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the wholesale price of her milk from five penny a litre from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price resulting from a two-pence increase in February, and follows a search by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide whether they will go in turn, increase the price to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had been changed for the last time, in 2002.
A former Bangladeshan PM refused bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail application from former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested upon his return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to give her bail because of her consideration for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was PM.
This is one of the many accusations against him.
Khaleda Zia, the constant rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks' time, but her party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's interim military government give her full freedom first.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of his release are contradictory because if he is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why he could not remain free on his return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail since she was authorized to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
His lawyers argued that she needed this guarantee to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after 17 October, said a former leader of the Awami Party.
She was detained last year after the acting military government took over power, but was released in June to care for abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, denies the charges they are charged with.
Concerns about the Afghan campaign against polio.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign because of Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign last week in all six provinces.
But it does not claim to be successful in contacting children from the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesman said that this took place despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the judicial battle of ITV
BSkyB has lost its trial following the Commission's decision on Competition, which would oblige it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement aimed at preventing NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV shares raised doubts as to the effective independence of ITV, therefore, the Competition Commission's investigation
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing her to reduce her ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary it was excessive – especially since BSkyB had just given up its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutors' case.
U.S. Attorney General appointed a special accuser to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of the White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who claim that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special accuser Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious accusations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his major recommendations.
The dispute began with the outbreak in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed due to poor benefits.
But it then emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no longer criticised than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to assign to these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others refused to investigate the allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting the courts for the government.
It is certain that they may be fired at any time, but cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and eventually he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical to the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdication" his role as leader, "remarkably succeeding not to be involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including the former collaborator of Bush, Karl Rove, were critical of not being able to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic will have to be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The award-winning evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly leaves
The song, written by Jim Steinman, demanded a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was commercialized in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, in the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of her real name- suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure her heartbeat becoming irregular, after she collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then we found him a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Shadow Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and Maybe Be Soon for Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents do not know how to get to Extra Place, because they never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to confuse with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to reopen Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbours, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the pastry houses.
But the Department of Preservation and Building Development of the city that runs the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighbourhood owners' committees, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal allowing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There remains only a few spaces belonging to the city, and we would like the city to preserve Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that while society wants to exploit the street, it doesn't necessarily mean she wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to look back on this abandoned drive, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city that suggested the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, stressing further that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been bearing this name since 1802, when the legacy of the great farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has been abandoned since.
The later entrance of CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo covered by Ramones' album " Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, harnesses, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be placed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducts a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York ("The Book of Answers: A Nostalgic View on A City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small ass-sack narrow, dark day as night, and defined by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and Persians, full of newspapers last week that fly along the droplets."
With few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A short rat agile at the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown out.
Some passersby said they only rarely think at Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, for his part, said he felt that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have been found in dark, wet and disgusting places."
Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
In this part of the Education Supervision Program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates regarding bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former student in California, and a former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you don't think about it. Why middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign points out that "Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students."
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education programme supports in particular among many other topics, "the bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends instruction in language classes other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school east of Los Angeles County.
Students at this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Of the CM1, 100% students passed the 2008 math state exam, an expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-language art exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient that Mr. Obama made.
Sixth Street focused on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of the Sixth Street, this school has set up the English language education "full immersion".
The total English immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in education.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "We had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without his class, you wouldn't have had a chance to identify him."
"It works, she observes, "it worked for us"
Obama should not take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
Although he is in favour of the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama has recently considered this issue as insignificant, when he proclaims that we must all stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider the models of education that work, rather than dedating them or regard them as insignificant.
Drop Nette du Petrole as a result of the World Economic Concerns
Oil prices have dropped significantly on Monday, as people fear that the rescue plan for financial marches will not succeed in restoring the economy.
The operations in the end of crude oil dropped by 7 per cent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Mercantile Stock Exchange was sold this morning.
The prices have dropped more than $20 in the barrel since Monday.
Over the past two weeks, raw material markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having known in July, an increase of $145,29 in the barrel, prices dropped to almost $90 in the barrel this month, before rebounding in view of the deep uncertainties of the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the rescue agreement, the greatest in history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, the government said this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have in part nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts have stated that the frenetic negotiations of this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement, seem to have failed to revive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the prospect of global equity, interest rate and market exchange has become uncertain" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the US virus would spread globally and in particular, in China."
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the drop in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, they were forced to decrease by 20 percent, the forecast of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Day of the Second Determining Time for the Improvement of Team Record.
After having spent the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets Shaun Ellis uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played salt under dark clouds.
Then back quarter Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an afternoon during which their relationship made a bond forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first one when a corner back fell and the second one, 10 seconds from the middle time.
"I didn't leave my area" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing the catch, the defense beat the Cardinals back quarter, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let himself escape the ball because of Warner.
The last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 yards taking an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best the Jets could have marked in a while.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "second time or third time?"
When we told him the Jets let go of 21 unquestionable points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebslelassie restated, exceeds its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, has again proved worthy of his title as the best runner of the century, having beaten his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 of a comfortable race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat 27 seconds its record of 2:04:26, played last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his great career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing - it may be too much in the eyes of today, - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at start, 55 degrees at arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the decline of the marathon record more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa wins in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, had suffered cramps two weeks before, and had missed training for a week.
It is clear that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I gave up last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He was particularly criticized in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - having too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a race track, and considering more world records than the meaning of the competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebrselassie's capabilities as a background runner.
On Sunday, Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. to my way.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselasia after the heads of the line disappeared.
A little more than three miles from the arrival, Gebrselasia made its final climb to stand out from Kwambai, which ends second in 2:05:36, improving its best five-minute personal record.
Kamathis is third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She was unable to participate in the Beijing games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
It runs using a skilled strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyans to take a great advantage, then exceeding about 18 thousand 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, ends third in 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Organ and the Tests of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where pride and complications of African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first fully black town to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description that she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make today."The city with five lakes, three crochet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison".
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival that is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city that it describes has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression- Era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is as independent, worthy, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he loses."
Even though it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the foreign eye.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident of the city and the oldest parishioner.
"It must be in conformity with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and combat.
It represents both a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point but also an example of Southist black rural culture - sometimes undecided, sometimes acclaimed - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere books, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide transformed this city, just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which leads to the chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious such a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"passing the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds whose Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he knows hardly how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve passersby.
So, just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government, but also with illiteracy, rowing, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality " declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalized, quoting colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added, "some people did not appreciate it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many were mocking her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also added, swinging in his chair of the back patio that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "it never remained too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a tomb at Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she's offering to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of "wrapped in Rainbows", a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials from Orange County wanted to pass a five-way highway in town, to replace Boulevard Kennedy, a two-way main street in the community.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville returned from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race mix dispute led to hatred at the doors of the community.
"At that time, a band of white young people came to throw oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"A lady has even died."
They launch a pastry from their car."
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorious of my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"the black children used to be kissed," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as Head of the Savings of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because it's white--I mean there's here, a line of cultural demarcation," said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have allowed to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who went beyond the damage, such as her, armed with a joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began fighting to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography named after Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to American cannons.
The motorway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter had found her appeal.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston regard her as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival's inauguration two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the story refuted the proposal of the highway.
"The five-way highway fiasco, extremely fast, real civic pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summarized the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A single theme library (of course named Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, remodeled.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be regarded as a rear street after a summer rainy day, as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
( 90 percent black today)
Foreigners who have come to discover the history of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with caution.
We must ask permission for most interviews, and certain things - such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Melle Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weak for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will not be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to regard Eatonville as Hurston's whole race: beautiful, problematic and all, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is good for sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional strength.
And even for the younger ones, such as 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think: "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after last Sunday's Mass.
But if you stop and take the time to look at history, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone is talking finance.
Still, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think only in the glass offices and bee nest over their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "workday in the office" since the crack of 1929.
Deliverers continue to falsify on the sidewalks, with their trolleys and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The Latinos always drag between the residential buildings bearing, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke arranged on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwiches to walkers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16 and 19 hours a week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Luckily, I planned to work at the end of the afternoon, because I found out at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people tailing.
Not in front of the cashier's shops, nor to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service window, where the usual customers ordered their checkups, the tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would learn later from Starr, my "authorized personal banker", were all tailing for the same reason as me.
Not the same, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called Thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only work in a state, and who say they treat customers like their families.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327, used the bankruptcy union, and as the New Yorkers would come home for the weekend and Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, on account of a saving value of $440 million, desperately sought a buyer to save it.
The office and shop employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential break, transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that makes the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that failed, and her lean CEO Dick Full, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the concierge in uniform of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetables merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria sways to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "city against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating rubble mosques in red.
The Police accuses extreme right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of the far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the cemetery of Traun, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; it is according to the police, an organized action.
Offenders have painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; however, detectives think that this could have been done to disguise the extremists' hatred of Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somewhat linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that reaches its end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, following its shift to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme-right parties that had inflated almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to criticism, xenophobics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of the scarf and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to the alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are attempting to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, have defined the far right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made the difference, because they are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter forbids travel abroad.
The courts banned the glamorous rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had expressed his intention to go to Spain through France to the authorities under his control.
The Police in Kent had given this ban to travel last Thursday after proving to the magistrates Glitter the guilt for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in the limited court courts of Ashford, but was nevertheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson said "Tuesday, 25 September, in the Ashford court, Kent's police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64 years old, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, left to be registered on the lists of sexual abusers.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police seven days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent's police said she would not discuss any particular cases or potential Glitter movements in the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "Kent's police will do everything they need to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"according to us, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"Protecting Kent's inhabitants is the most expensive intention to the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after having served 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, 10 and 11 years respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and eventually he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory and were therefore obliged to go to Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge, West London, for registered in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom for the detention of images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travel in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no strange clothes.
The essence of the flamenco masters, released from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen views of artists who do not care to get on stage.
German Günther Bauer blends in "Flamenco - people" the theatre of some performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer resumes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a clean personality and character.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of the flamenco stars."
With the festival "Song Popular des Mines", Bauer began a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a photo-plated camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, remind the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not dance or singing in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for essentials and magic has been the constant of this work presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
The flamenco stars like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has transformed into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a longer or longer moment.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that you sometimes don't know or that leave you just a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located on the 20th Street of the Mata (the road parallel to the people of Hercules) which will be opened until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "real bold"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he works on, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and went through the Amazon.
The favourite at the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday to the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real daring" and that "everything demonstrates that it should not write it."
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days he saw parade in the city of the aqueduct about a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and completed his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award in the majority of the participants' voices, made a full room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
Félix Romeo, the Festival's presenter, faced a fascinating audience who did not see the past time during which Peru, with a prodigious memory and a great dose of humor, traced back the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his desire to read" and "live new experiences"; how he wrote of a "very methodical way" through intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no means" to measure and know whether books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it has "effects" and "makes people less like", because the writers were asked "not to let themselves go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather destroys Pozoblanco's fair
The flag party that concluded the bulls races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse torso had verified that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather hit this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
On the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have faced in the arena of Castilblanco
So only Friday's party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was carried into triumph, after having made arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetic.
The afternoon itself Alejandro Talavante concluded on two flags planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the steps discovered applauded more than his own fight with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was suffocated by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Basque Police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter take the flight.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashisch, of what to stop them.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was accused of drug trafficking and of falsifying documents.
The incident took place when various officials from the Alva Traffic Unit carried out vehicle control on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the control started.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further down the coast, where the two occupants had come down to escape to a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, a Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch balloons, and then they transferred to a police station for extensive inspection and weighed the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" because it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they charged the prisoner with a crime of falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues his investigation to arrest the other suspect, who has managed to escape and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A. A. J., was cautioned to carry out the various steps and will be tried within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effect of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw him do strange maneuvers trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesperson from the California police patrol revealed to the People magazine.
The witness said that about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "put his foot down on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the agents led her to the drug and alcohol centers to perform a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was removed from the beginning, although "according to the observation of the police officers at first sight, we thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of having led under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of the Arizona clinic where she was hospitalized to treat herself with a nervous breakdown.
Calls asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The Coordinator General and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Councillor of the Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after having been accused of performing favourable treatment for members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the conduct of the political party he will adopt in the city council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Sangre de Mayo", the dared bet of Garci
Drawing on the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried to "show the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting more than two and a half hours," Sangre de mayo » will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
A great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci makes sure that with this film "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago, to play a commemorative film for the two hundred years of the 2nd May Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been deceived as a leader in the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get funding like for the films "Capitaine Alastriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double the one obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated during almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Back to Start" influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he is used to repeat before starting the shooting and to whom he does not do casting, since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times candidate for Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven tables of French billiard" and finally the winner, "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're just making an extra movie," says Garci after over 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the sevillane dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will pay tribute to a also Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and argued for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter suggested that I interpret the Sevillan Dancer Tortola Valencia and it seemed amazing to me."
According to the dancer, "we don't try to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
His dance titles made me think of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she says.
The performance was made thanks to two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of her performances, as he had done at "The Open Door"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with her student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and this honors me."
The performance was also performed thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered to be divas".
This work also tells, in some ways, the life of this woman who has exhibited herself in places so far away, especially at the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it is these women who have enormous influence in their time and now nobody knows and highlights her work," says Bayón.
The show will start at 8.30 pm at the Teatre Lope de Vega
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trinnat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This light people" which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling to the different Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
America less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them."
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with her in "Absence of malice", and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been running since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, American esteem has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, only humans are left with admiration and there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He incarnated for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug combat created in honour of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had the difficulty of imposing itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He has placed the bar on us," noted George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who tries to penetrate the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in today's media jungle.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even if the opportunities did not lack him for not being.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"For all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist," he says.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympic Games organisation race
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I ever took.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of a deleterious note.
But let us examine everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors start with the removal of the folders, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it would be better for them to give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They only made you go there to take the back (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue of waiting) surprise!, there was only the size 'S 'for the jersey (second error, because I needed an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy small-sized jerseys with less fabric and then less expensive?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Apart from the fact that you need to go early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your back bag at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line of waiting, the competitions started and we had not yet left our back bag at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults took place in the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be included in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me who, I think, did not properly mark the departure.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, it would not come especially to me with the idea.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.s.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
A new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented at the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to travel on the company campus) in response to what was asked during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who are - including recalling which posts they occupy - and listening to and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also bring them together according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and tells her she'll respond in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding features and "extra" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly stressed that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operating system will always be needed as it is the essential basis for understanding computer equipment and software.
It occupies the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear but must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more attention to the Internet browser.
We light up the computer only to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than running windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, confined months, less complex.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they eventually become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of Microsoft employees' spare rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not leave at the beginning of 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore it in Edward Zwick's 'Diamant of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in 'Le Parrain' de Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the association of muscle gays.
And if we start to list all its appearances, we could also quote this mustachu coast that raised weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a men's shirt in cotton, grinding and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles distinguishes himself from all others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although known as ' Marcel' - which has to do with sport since he takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' distinguishes itself from the others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, by its distinctive logo and by the little Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the best known body shirts have in the neck.
But pay attention, because the Belgian brand not only produces top tanks.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babes, mini shorts...
Dresses designed for the comfort of the undergarments.
Even though it is a pity to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His huge resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
The Cruz sisters are currently taking their new activity very seriously in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not only beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
It was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important prices of fashion than the Spanish sponsoring house.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day, but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 60s enchants us and we inspire much for our collections.
I love walking around town and watching the women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman: aren't you?
I believe that yes, but at the end of the day everything gets together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of myself.
Dancers love to dress well for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in acting, when you wear your clothes, that's when you actually put yourself in character's skin.
All of a sudden, it's all related.
You had it not 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, I have 30 years of joy.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoy life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was a kid and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna become a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me and, besides, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year.
It's true, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I'm a woman from the theatre, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like to have everything now but of course it's not possible.
I've been looking forward to the films 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the tomb of Christ'.
See what you'll think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to do the mannequin.
Naomi Campbell simply called me, I've known her for a long time, to invite me to participate in London at a charity parade for her association in support of women's support and the clothes we were showing - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender person.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things aren't true.
Besides, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Recidivists of alcohol on the steering wheel will have to install the 'alcohol' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholism to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the start of the vehicle in drinking condition, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is to reinstate the driver by offering him courses in road re-education.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety but also the Directorate General for Road Safety and the Foundation Institute for the Safety of Car will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once intoxicated, resumes the car.
Alcohol will avoid this because it is a connected system on the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the one allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people each year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by regular means, but criminal reform requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the scheduled official time, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Asturias Princes were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar at Benito Juárez airport in Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of going to bed, but its rays still required to put their hands in a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official journey.
- Oh, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you here or so...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've been here thinking for two years.
- Oh, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Asturias Princes are and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several to wait in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military range of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in sea blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very heavily and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before going into the room where the official court awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a rigorous journalist from Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no live designer more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Button-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of the new talents of fashion.
The winner will be rewarded with a price of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in the Mango window at the 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost wept for them.
Certainly, it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier de Paris.
With the table next to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and making against bad good fortune, because of his brother's recent death, Nati put on a dress of Mango and some hairs of ELAH, which cut off his breath, and arms on him, arm down with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rochetil ended the evening without a dress because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with a pants and a shirt – of her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphosed by wearing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and recalling the good old time, she seized one of the bars and made the gesture of a large fold '.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace dependencies, but she showed us earlier on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moved by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked in advance that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the number of stress
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The morning awakens us almost when it sounds every morning at 7 o'clock, but it's even worse when we think of the restless pace that imposes our present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to fight day-to-day fatigue and work-related problems.
But 1001, neither one more nor one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu of methods adapted to each's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the bookstores directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not run into your veins to restore your body balance and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the sofa, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some kids talk during the night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens may surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It's a benign sleep alteration called sleepwalking.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadicly (once in life for example associated with a severe fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often related to other sleeping disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night uresis (bedding in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very severe fevers, stress situations or overexcitation.
It's a little studied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with screams, cries, long speeches ...
In the event that sleepoloquia becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to get an explanation of this problem.
We said that this is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleeping alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV shows that are more or less violent.
With very nervous and relaxing children, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm indoors.
This will enable the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what it says (which is not usual), do not be tempted to question it for information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep, he's not aware to be able to organize his thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his land after a long period of dessert.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the largest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting where attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the Captain Visitor Kauffmann who frowned the candle on a distant shot, Illhaeusern would take slightly the ascendant and turn Fonderflick from far, then with Hirn above, Romain from the end of the foot or Diebold came to rock the defense of Dannemarie.
On the front, we were stuck in the middle of the field and we were just leaving the Riahi uphill at the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time was to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball pushed on a first attempt by Diebold (53th').
But the Illhousian editor will not be able to enjoy his happiness long and will be forced to return the dressing room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose major problems to an illusian Eleven who has just retreated a bit to "compact" his defense, apart from the last few seconds of the game where, after a big mess, the ball passed very close to the cross.
Sarkozy to meet angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a diversion by Britain.
In the face of the demonstration of force of fishermen who severely disrupted the access of several ports of Breton and Normandy on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope he will "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that comes at the same time as a general meeting of the "Crission Committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures to deal with the price of diesel, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesperson, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and pay for the marines".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out escargot operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing plugs close to 10 km.
The pleasure port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle Island did not stop.
A filter dam was launched on Quiberon Island.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the Brest ports, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic façade and the Manche, such as the Olonne Sands, in Vendée, where the trawlers remained on dock, or the Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Donges refinery.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting in the department to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" has to decide on Tuesday about the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the planned interview with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will leave nothing" and "do not want to move to Paris", for example announced Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on the diesel fuel, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre but feel that the profitability threshold of a vessel is only reached with a diesel fuel of less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Beautiful
The unforgettable "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" performer died of cancer at the age of 83 in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes praised the legend of the film and the actor involved, Paul Newman, died at the age of 83.
Embracer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian airliner's 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the global economy's recession threats.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains his delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half, the airliner delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot of the Chinese market, particularly for his aircraft from the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving over 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have merged, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activities in the United States, according to the newspaper that cites sources close to the file.
The board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to discuss possible assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from IGA.
Assets whose IGA plans to separate include its subsidiary of Air Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings Reassurer as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision was taken on these assignments, followed by the TF.
AIG must quickly realize liquidity in order to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting to two proportions the current shareholders.
Analysis Paris Session History Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the highest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, with technological dominance, yielded 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's expanded index 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), at 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank rescue plan which was to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected their plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"It shows how far the market was in this area," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would not "be too late".
"If the project is actually dying (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, Ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, economic leader at Global Insight.
And further emphasizing the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution to the United States," said Mrs. Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual Friday, the authorities organized the repurchase of the banking activities of Wachovia by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benin, Iceland and Germany, signs that markets face "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The performance of the ten-year Treasury Bond declined to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% Friday evening, and the 30-year-old to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama, winner at the points of the first TV duel
At the first Friday debate between the two White House candidates succeeded another to know who took it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the QGs of Republican and Democratic Campaign proclaimed their own victory in this TV duel that would have been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, has not been sufficiently "bright" enough to allow him to slow down in five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose an opinion survey published on Saturday, gives Obama a five-point advance (49% versus 44% to McCain), believes that it was the democrat who pulled his pinball from the game.
In the undecided voters, who are those who count, Obama came out victorious for 39% of the polls, while 25% of them win McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected of his co-worker, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
It has good instincts," however Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
McCain's septuagen has had to put forward his indisputable foreign policy experience, while stressing his opponent's "naivety" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that he was representing the future.
Without dismounting, it proved concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, if," retorted, this weekend, a democratic spot reproaching the republican for not having taken the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American street".
"During the ninety-ten minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama yesterday denounced, before 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a beating rain.
He did not even say the words "medium class" or "workers."The financial route clearly benefits Obama, who is regarded by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the brink of precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point," thought the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debate "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that 95 per cent of Americans would still be able to reduce their taxes despite Wall Street overruns, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that the realization of possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was her first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
Prudents, the two candidates avoided the financial rescue issues of $700 billion (EUR 470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there was an election, did you?"
Young people and opponents manifested on Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday night after the closing of the polling stations on the central place in Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislature.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confesses that they have not even voted: "What a good thing, since they will do what they want with my voice," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been a good figure for foreign observers in order to resume their language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by the observers as their own.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been held apart from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the stripping," Iuri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, deplored a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is that it counts the votes, and in our homes, is the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not reform ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition was concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process did not recognize the validity of the vote.
She stressed that participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) had opened the vote to all manipulations.
"You noted that there was an election, you asked Social Democratic Leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night goes back to the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
Interview - Safe blood returned
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously shaken by the blood scandal contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the grunt of the public, in February 1994 the Government of Canada instituted a public investigation, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, which sought to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not happen again.
While Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces then established a committee to plan for a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
As a result of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said proudly, saying that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "confidence is something extremely fragile".
Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle since its establishment on 28 September 1998.
At that time, many cases of human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, emerged in Europe.
"And we didn't know at all whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
At that time, one of the main recommendations of Krever and Gélineau reports was based on the fact that when it is not known and a serious disease can result in the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is characterized by brain degeneration which inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
Thus, in April 1999, the blood of people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
A few years ago, however, it was demonstrated beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive technique of HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow the presence of the virus itself and not anti-virus antibodies to be detected directly in the blood of donors, on which the tests used so far were based.
The TAN has been able to shorten the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period was reduced to less than one week.
This has significantly reduced the risk that some donors are infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says head of management of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, was transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
"Necessity increases because the population grows older.
Since anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cell or platelet recharge.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Every healthy person aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria can nevertheless give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria occurs, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they grow old and can no longer give their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so scary, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving of his blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the sole public blood bank of cordon in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cordon blood and we plan to take more than a thousand a year.
It should begin to be proposed for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood removal program as very popular.
"More mothers are disappointed to be unable to access it", because Hema-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Half-Final Impact
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a win of 3-1 (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, at the second and decisive game of the fourth round of the final at the total goals, at Stade Saputo.
The middle of the ground Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After an aimless first half on one side and another, the David Testo and Rocco Plancentino field centre marked the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first round-trip game on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
On Saturday evenings in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a deficit of 3-1 in the return match to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still got access to the 5-4 half-final round to the total goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victory goal of Kovalev
The number one Canadian trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn stimulated the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win on dam shots in front of the Panthers of Florida last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the encounter, scored one goal, Plekanec raised two aids, and Kovalov picked up a pass in this gain, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalov gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest placed on the North
The Prime Minister shall not exclude from holding elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was completed, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to be elected during today's by-election.
"Strengthening the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, a sort of Moulin was projected in images.
They were looping, on three huge screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric dams, mining operations, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means as well as in the electoral period.
At the press point, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the elections this fall, even if he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister merely explained why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give due time, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: including hydropower, forest, but especially the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's listing.
This "territory twice as large as France", "is at home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it is in us," he insisted, as well as to show that he was demanding a national founder myth.
Quebec built a lot in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's to us, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70 per cent of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, specified the Prime Minister at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity comes, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said by talking about the northwest pass, which will open all year round because of the ice fountain.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the Territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pakistani MP of Ungava), have already started consultations with about 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) had an important place started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we shall give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally respectful," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with that of previous Liberal Prime Ministers.
"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently about transforming the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rebaptize the Beauharnois Centrale in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage who made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, in Borassa who made the James Bay, our party knew how to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press point, he invoked another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydro-electric dam project, Charest stressed that its implementation was planned for 2012.
"That remains between us, but I plan to be there," he entrusted his militants, sparking a lively applause at them.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably in 2009, did not deviate from the opportunity to conduct an election this fall, which the law allows him to.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was fulfilled, including by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ particularly calls for recognition of the "speciality of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and to have a veto on decisions made in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the main lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The Pakistani leader, Pauline Marois, emerged from the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today," said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (voting today), Françoise Mercure.
The DQA said it supported the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this isn't just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, who is back on vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (i.e. irony) in Harper's office, who last summer was allowed to say of Louise Arbour that she was an "honest" for Canada.
This is how to look at this woman who has waged an ongoing fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration to say so long about the Prime Minister's environment as well as Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have returned its national locked in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take any account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts brought against him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and allows an inhuman child soldier to collapse.
The only one who relies on a court order to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us bear in mind that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of the Canadian Bar, inter alia, advocate the repatriation of Omar Khadr for a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that shuts its eyes to torture: no matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We do not yet realize this, but at the moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", this word that Harper keeps branding and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
This is the time when no morals exist: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a government leader until now a minority (so it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party advocating the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this resignation, and not anywhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17th edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Canadian Mining Vice-President Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has attempted a defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without drunkenness in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecution in defamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the editor of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defence and to fight, to very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by nearly bottomless pockets of mining.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will stem the opposition in addition to defrauding anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold is working, discussions in Canada are usually done through the exchange of ideas rather than by a matraquel blow.
It was therefore sufficient for the mine to open its books, its files and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could both ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the views of that same audience?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to paid wholesale lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather close view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What he doesn't understand - or he doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does it first because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is prepared to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a prosecution-barrier (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has, moreover, filed a complaint with the authors of Black Canada urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's pursuit is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It also denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that disturb the rich businesses of this world in a country such as Canada, who will be able to do so under repeated prosecution?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada's authors.
She has a right to reply.
The academic environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit these kinds of abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest plan of economic rescue since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new US$700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been taking place in Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by both Congress Chambers.
It includes: better control by the electors of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for failure to pay, as well as a right to look at wages paid to the executives of the assisted companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done in such a way as to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on the American daily life will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had made a start in the last few hours out of fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline for opening the markets this morning was agreed.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their discontent that they were forced to reach that end.
Democrat Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, in particular that to allow owners to keep their homes and that on the salary of government-backed business leaders.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be welcomed.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American television waves.
Asked about another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The main lines I have read [show] that it is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the doubtful, risky and unspoiled debts of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of mortgage at risk (subprimary) credits before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a freeze on liquidity and on the imbalance of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elites who had made the first draft of the agreement capitulate last week.
It is believed that this impasse has been lifted since Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are assured only by the government rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone at Congress, a provision was also added that if the government was to take five years' losses with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its placement.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion to which additional 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion more should be endorsed by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will be able to obtain participations in assisted companies that will be worth dividends in case of profit and that it will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for housing related to the real estate loans involved in this plan, as well as to set limits on pay and departure allowances paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plans will have the green light.
In fact, votes continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
"Of course, Washington does not hear you," stated Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Commission to his electors.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one to take advantage of taxpayers."
An entertainer of a small group at the Congress called "the caucus of the sceptics", the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but arrives at the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to tell us: Congress is asked not to hurry and carefully examine the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had renounced its full-fledged competitor since it had lost EUR 2 billion (US 2.9 billion) in the risk real estate loan crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, a right to vote in the bank and influence is recovered.
It is precisely something that savings and households now appreciate that times are uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be attempting to nationalize another bank under the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all ongoing loans from Bradford and Bringley, including more than US$ 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it was the one who would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed
His beauty in the eyes of the day was long his full map, some will say his weakness.
If he had been released from the narcissical mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, following lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the latest icons in American cinema of the past few years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he had long been a kind of screen rival, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostolate of freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, of a German Jewish father and of a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last brand of quality.
Because in him a whole country was conceived with self-made man, the Pacific War Fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, television, soon at the cinema.
The same man who enlisted for civic rights was also the driver who ranked second at 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of this secret, discreet, engaged, allergic to the sparks of the show-business are also disappearing with him, whose enigma will not have been completely penetrated.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance sought the vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, as his great roles interspersed on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parades through it.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) returns in memory, the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on an adapted burning roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone through history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked by hatred), by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, resumed after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic malfract in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will resume his character on his return to Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar on nine appointments in 1987.
That face through the ages, it was him.
Still him.
The eras are bouncing through its course.
Young people know him primarily through George Roy Hill's very cultious Slap Shot (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of an orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found it in 1994 in Brother Coen's The Hudsucker Proxy.
With one last role as sponsor of the Irish Mafia in Road to Losing Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against several film legends that left the trade soon enough, Newman will remain in saddle, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its facets and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humour, "as a challenge living at "underplaying" judging its benefits too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles have long fallen all dressed up in the beak.
However, he played less often the first young than the marginals: neuroscientists, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman reveals ill-known facets of his true pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew an end to a feminine portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film to Harry and Son in 1984, a work of powder and sadness.
Among the rain on Newman, his great and former comrade Robert Redford (who had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his career as a legend, he also became a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of Hollywood's drifts.
We've seen a lot of his wellt thunder on vinegar pots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of bad taste, although gag at first.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, has committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and above.
What could possibly make Zuschlag &amp; Company in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the current criminal procedure will begin, against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, which has resulted in particularly significant damage.
According to the public prosecutor's office, money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the state and municipalities, approximately HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand in the caisses of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to pay the money of the grants obtained by issuing invoices of fees, after which no actual benefit was provided and thus, the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they were providing invoice books in the Józsefváros market, while they made the seals in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's deposition, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the model on which they made the other invoices they were going to introduce, inter alia, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as with the City of Capital for access to grants.
The majority of invoices were created by István Lados and by his accomplice András . .ri, who, according to our information, was primarily concerned with drafting the files necessary for obtaining the grants.
In a search circuit, one of Lados' choice was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, this place has ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will subsequently bear the name of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, was full of forms and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
The issuers of invoices to the overflowing imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, which also belonged to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither Jobb Jövőert's name nor the name of Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor.
Győző Farkas, the company manager, told the hvg.hu website that when the prosecutor's office summoned him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: "Beyond the shape, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people stayed there, did not collide either, since this establishment only counts eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zero invoices also did not inquire about the travel agencies in Budapest, which were part of their choice, but only organize travel abroad. Thus, they naively indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be settled in cash, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
They also added VAT on these documents, while travel activities benefits, which are located outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Revfülöp in the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Furthermore, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the fakes were handwritten.
The prosecution's investigation shows that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as a provision the carriage of goods by road, that the invoice issuing company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
Moreover, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of inadequate invoices and false stamps, that invoices issued in the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehertó's sports internship, which both refuse to be the authors of invoices issued on their behalf.
Nor did the falsaries pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at their home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company refused to issue this bill.
Deliberate invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has established an invoice on the order of the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and in 2003, issued invoices at the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of about five million HUF, but behind which no benefits were actually provided.
Neither did any financial movement take place since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this was avoided by the agencies in their accounts.
The following category of invoice companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the Director General of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with fuel trade and car vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices concerning the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. company of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he robbed their countervalue.
It is precisely at Ivan Kubatov's request that Romanian masons created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were working, which the accused explained by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as the editor of the founding acts of the companies, he established invoices by their names, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov gave to organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The public prosecutor's office believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on invoices as well as VAT went to Kubatov's pocket.
Man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictional invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért applied for a grant from the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy twice as many as 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft were presented to TMA.
In addition, these invoices were found during the search conducted in the office of Harpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a part of the accused will report the method of manufacturing invoices, as she had already done before the public prosecutor's office.
What might be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the least details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his own interest, or whether, possibly, socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would bear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is likely to be vexed, since applications for his supervised residency, based on a reduction in his detention conditions, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, await their own home at the end of the proceedings. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of the auction: why do we spend more money?
In auction sales, buyers tend to spend more and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in Neurology and Economics at the University of New York have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic bases of this apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced during this kind of competition, such as an eBay auction sale, and that is why they prefer to even pay too high a price.
These researches have tried to develop a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" using sales at experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a sale at play auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging process (RMF), researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the sale to auctions whose essential element is the oversale of a third party, the whole under the brain stem, called striatum, was moving intensively during the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
That is why, according to researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the leak in the face of the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, economic members of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups were overcrowded against a partner, under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they did so.
In another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were winning the part, then they would receive an additional $15 in reward.
While the third group received this $15 before the auctions, the members of the group also lost this money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is, in fact, that the emphasis was placed on victory in one side, while in the other, on failure.
By thus proving the assumption of neurologists, the members of the player team "against failure" were willing to take higher steps than those performed by the control group and the "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena found during auction sales only by the pleasure of winning and the parade at risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped eliminate the contradiction between the two theories, leading to a third explanation now." - noted Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
One hundred miles are estimated to be the patients with hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment, which is because the patients often do not know they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to liver infections caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and yellowness are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases generated differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, vaccination against viruses A and B is nevertheless recommended. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, in general, accompanied by a general poor condition, weakness, stomach and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible yellowness, the saddles become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die of the most serious form of this pathology, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not aware of the virus, because the pathogen suddenly destroys the liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing.
Pollution is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult its physician treating from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the organizations representing patients in the four corners of the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Do those who grow up in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article that said researchers at Oxford University had an interesting experience by analyzing how much belief in God could influence tolerance to human pain.
As part of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electrochocs, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
The results show that Catholic believers have been able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience takes place as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and disseminating electrochocs is set on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with hermine painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
Researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evoked a sort of state of faith among believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, was about its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, they received 20 electrochocs in four successive parts, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general one.
Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safely", as someone we "care for" and they "quieted down, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% pain less than when looking at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided we find the appropriate picture.
"We should find an image in which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, indeed change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if one Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same size were shown to believers?
Would the view of a Virgin Mary of the highest quality lead to better results?
You're what you disclose about yourself.
On the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google claims that he can be found at the bottom of people's pockets in the same way as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their centers of interest are.
However, it is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, that is one of the influential people of society.
While with regard to skeptics that parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they do not exactly see the essentials of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google's founders can meet their initial goal that sounds like: "Gather in a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google's leader interviewed, after ten years of global camouflage work, they are always at the beginning of their objectives of being able to process all information.
On the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What work would be best for me?". However, the software will only be able to answer this kind of question, at first sight, on the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by interested people are precisely listed.
Through the Custom Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and consult what they have sought, what they have clicked on. Through this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to provide much more personalized responses, and will submit products and services based on our previous declarations and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my work is? ask users, who are worried about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can provoke counter-reaction among netizens.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, allowing an identification.
Human rights netizens were able to spark a sigh of relief last May, when Google, an arm below with the EFF legal protection agency, proved its right to the FBI court. According to the judgement made, in the future, Google will still not be forced by any of the points in the constitution to disclose information on the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it has won in relation to strengthening the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier. But ultimately, it has not managed to obtain the lists of private users' searches, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion against multinational societies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savageons" bringing together the fans, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of large companies, the "single corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, and that, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its ID code users, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and software package, continuously cooled, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what the web 2.0, the most popular keyword of recent years, just pulls it right behind them.
Indeed, web 2.0 is all about collaboration, the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we serve channels of communication made available to us, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing their musical habits. Then, he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which they automatically appear their latest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or on Picasa.
While we can learn from many examples, such as that of the little friend who easily understands in the morning pictures, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the society that fired one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, one can be on one thing: the term of privacy is completely to reconsider today.
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and that is how the principle can be defined by hiding behind the behaviour of today's youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least, he wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, he can do it (for example, starting with Scroogle, using Google's search system, but at the same time leaving no trace intentionally).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not less. Google's online services, through the processing of text to image processing, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and that do not resemble our best profile, which have so far existed.
Public opinion waits, without really hiding it, when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while benefits introduced at an ever-increasing rate lead to serious migraines not only in Microsoft, but also in many other computer program creators.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all of this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of society has refused, in its entirety, employee protests, after it has doubled the price of the company's motherhood and after the company has considered the daily multiple restoration too costly, taken at any time. All this seems ridiculous in addition to the fact that Google has reached before the Chinese government in 2006, and according to the terms of their agreement, society detects all the results that harm the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some believe that Google's book scan and archive project takes such important dimensions that society will soon find itself in the face of the United States Supreme Court, others tremble at its Health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical benefit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in an exhausting way only through Google data.
Two minors helped to remove traces of Ozd's double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ozd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the department of Borsod.
Young people have acknowledged the facts they have been accused of complicity for now.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, are free to defend themselves.
The complicity of murder can lead to detention for up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ozd, a young man from the 23-year-old corner, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it was found that the 23-year-old man owed a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that is why he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ozd where he killed him, as well as this 9-year-old young man's daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of it.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made although the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the new potential owners' circle from the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to separate itself from more than 60% of its shares in a few months' activities.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid that has been made so far for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London stock exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far made an offer.
Petr Koblic, the Director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the best new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated at between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25 per cent participations, followed by 14.7 per cent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which is getting worse from day to day, European press leaders are already referring to a "second September 11th".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the President of the United States" - accuses the daily newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a proposal of law, improvised to life, designed to bring relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that led to the global economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system increases every day, and then the whole world will pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the vote of the congress, a real threat, the one Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - highlights the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still hold a lifeboat to their financial institutions, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, we need the European Union's states to do little of their national selfishness and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
Only Monday, the weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled Viennese daily Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands on the pocket, very deep, in a manner similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
Until now, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, passes, partly through the old continent.
The "saviors" should not immediately shake a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noticed in which case it would be rational to reach taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The smart car imitates the bourdon flight
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle if it was not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
For example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at the CEATEC, which took place in Japan, bourdonant bees gave the strategic idea of starting Nissan's engineers to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-robotized system, type BR23C, which he has equipped with bee qualities, with the ultimate objective being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee is its own space, of oval shape, which actually resembles much of our safe protection shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and the technological public relations of the brand.
The bee's face-eye plays a primary role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of face-to-face eye, engineers addressed the idea of laser telemeter.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C, evaluates distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, which transforms it into avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid the collision.
Contrary to any existing system, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
"If this was not the case, the mini auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the Director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what bees do to avoid other bees.
The process must take place at a glance.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, only the rotating movement, acceleration and slowing down as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot could be used.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentration is larger, which makes their life longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the intelligent instinctive reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only treat a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-bytes of continuous memory.
We don't need memory of a giga-byte capacity, or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards the design of an instant avoidance technology. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its entry into serial cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan to buy suspicious bank credits, and to use several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this is going to be spent.
Reuters announces that during further discussions until midnight, Saturday, local east coast time, Congress leaders agreed on the controversy that had existed for days and days, around the rescue plan of a total amount of $700 billion.
"We have made a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the US House of Representatives, according to which there is no more than to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a matter of rescuing Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m., local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2:00 a.m., depending on the local time in Central Europe), but did not cause spectacular rise in the scholarships.
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in response to the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson for the White House.
In addition, the programme differed from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent on one time, for the purchase of debt on doubtful credits.
The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the bill has been passed by Congress on Monday. This first sum will be used by Treasury Secretary to buy suspicious bank debts, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to establish a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase doubtful receivables, mortgages and doubtful mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent persons stated that purchases can take place as part of an auction sale, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools at the origin of the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast redemption of doubtful claims, insurance, or avoiding the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or the other important financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for the enforcement of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in bad postures and waiting for state aid can expect their starting allowances, simply called a gold parachute beyond the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
Wage caps are only mentioned in specific cases. Moreover, limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat offers its support to the company.
The ceiling principle means that if the Treasury secretariat buys in connection with an auction sale, they will collect an excess of gold parachute tax unless the retired bank president leaves the pension.
Directly after the redemption of doubtable receivables, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not overstated.
For the image to be complete, however, it must be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling concerns only the new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force regarding the generals' appointments - commented the chairman of the committee responsible for the financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State has a right to acquire shares in banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, as they can even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks will return on their legs.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will decide how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed doubts about this plan.
That is not why the American citizens have sent us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, thinks that they are the same ones who are pressing for action, as are those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 - communicates to the Central Bureau of Statistics of Hungary.
Industrial export prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared with those of a previous year, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic prices and exports, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to those of the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to those of the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices increased only to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry only increased by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and shoe manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), with first, the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, then the production of shoes with 2.5 per cent monthly increase.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing sector of chemicals and products (1.6 per cent).
A deflation resulted in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimum increase in wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, steam and water, representing a significant weight in the national industrial operation, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the price of gas established by the authorities since 1 July.
In a comparison of 12 months, taking into account the domestic sales of processing sectors, it is the prices of the oil processing sector that have experienced the most significant increase (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of metallurgical products, there was an increase in prices by 13.2 per cent, while in the important field of food production, beverages and tobacco, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions have occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the price increase increased between 0.6% and 9.1%.
In the entire processing industry, prices increased by 10.2 per cent during the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7 per cent in the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and by sector allocation in August were the investment profit-initiating sectors that showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and material-producing sectors for subsequent processing did not experience any change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and material production sectors for further processing (16.8%).
In the consumer goods production sectors, 6.8 per cent inflation was measured, while in the profit-initiating sectors a 1.4 per cent decrease was observed.
The export prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment fell by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, and 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar. Compared with August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro and 15.9 per cent compared to the dollar.
Next year, will there still be a need for visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz thinks there is a good chance that by January 12, the American-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will enter into force. This is what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "currently, everything depends only on the moment electronic entry and control systems beyond the Atlantic will be put into service".
Again and again, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from now on in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisors of candidates for the presidency, Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, along with John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, provided their support for the 700 billion-dollar government rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary to Treasury.
Following marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives at Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded agreements of principle on bank rescue.
This funding plan, aiming at the freeze of the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as fit as the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with the emphasis on economic questions, Obama has again succeeded in getting ahead. McCain's advance, obtained with Sarah Palin's appointment as a collegiate just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote on the 700 billion rescue plan law.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that it also supports.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a danger to your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
There was no lack of identification of McCain's economic ideas of surpluses.
In an interview with the ABC channel, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time taking it... but nothing to do is a way."
The Republican Senator stated that in the proposal, the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the capping of senior executives' starting allowances are mentioned, and that he was personally attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
The press review of German linguistic territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers".
According to this recognized polytologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took up its duties.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now, these same modern citizens turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and thus also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process was completed which was likely to occur, just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU had risen by 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be called upon to modernize "devoting its parents", established in the region consistently by the CSU.
It's been 40 years since sociologists announced this but they've been strongly wrong about the rhythm. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from the north and east in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain without consequence on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only inside the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more headered.
It is also surprising that during the past few weeks, it is precisely the groups of classic citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the independents, the artisans, the holder of the scholarship and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for the USC has fallen below 40 per cent.
Die Presse (depresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who ? Who ? Who ? Who ? Party Presidents hold on the reservation to the issues of the coalition", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that has settled after the Austrian elections.
Austrian Socialists of SPÖ want to discuss with the Conservatives of ÖVP.
ÖVP forbids SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in public television debates, party leaders hardly let their cards be interviewed.
Werner Faymann, president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration of the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the ÖVP, as Vice-Chancelier, remains open by Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Multererer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to get involved in ÖVP's internal affairs.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is currently a very open question, and these points must be discussed in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of BZÖ, is open again to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken.
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began in Paris, whose host is France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message before the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the consultation of experts, Lívia Járóka, Euro MP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the right that affects Roma children most and thus, one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, are invited to participate in the consultation.
According to the press office of the group of MP Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions found during the hirings, Roma disappear from the labour market, first of all, as a result of their low qualification.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary degrees, and as a result of elementary education of bad quality, only a small part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education degree."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a basic right of human beings plays a key role in the promotion of other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of the countries of the European Union.
According to the Euro MP, it is necessary to make these reports known in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Romans.
In fact, early on, a Roma child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the government budget.
"By their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and secular education." - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the Member of Parliament, collaboration by the European Union towards an objective and action is necessary for the immediate acceleration of the process of school disintegration, and for this, compliance with existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment needs to be broken, and the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children must be given to participate as citizens in full right to the future of Europe," Jaróka said.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the aim of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe held annually since the Berlin Summit last year is to ensure a single platform to support measures taken to promote equality of opportunity and to combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
It is in October that the decision will be taken on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite this painful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been adjourned.
The President of the Party, Erwin Hube and the Head of Regional Government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 per cent, will be on the agenda of the convention of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair felt, in any case, that they were not particularly attached to their seats.
As a result, they worked to soothe the angry members of the fraction and the base, who one day after the "Tsunami Bavarian" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the Socio-Christian Union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength is left.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria, giving 18 per cent of German GDP.
But conservatives still count heavily in this region of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, has also received a place in this modest reconnaissance group, which initiates lively discussions with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, trained along the right values, about a possible coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange nose of fate was that using the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose action against Stroiber was used as the possibility of puttingch performed by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then to treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without housekeeping.
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far pulled the chips into the backseats, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed on 28 September as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a few bitter remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be a chancellor if they are re-established in one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not negatively influence the great Berlin coalition.
However, this is relative because it will not be easier to manage the injured USC, and the socio-democratic crisis always lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko’s rivals: 110 - 0
No member of the opposition acceded to the Belarusian parliament after the elections on Sunday.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegalities committed during the removal of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize elections.
Although the legislation composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very effective in opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (OSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as President for the fourth time in questionable elections, on the traces of the amendment of the constitution in 2006, "will allow" this time the presence of some Members of the opposition to parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the anti-democratic Belarusian political order, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians did not receive an entry visa, was one of the opposition's expectations. Belarus had to take credit because of the ever more expensive reduction in imports of Russian natural gas, and thus contributed to the passage of Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines across the country, was passed on to Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, when assessing the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the prohibition of presenting itself for one third of the opposition candidates, referred to a pre-arrestment.
However, the OSCE communiqué of Monday had already challenged the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present when the vote was taken.
Despite all this, the opposition is still a tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize the South Ossetia and Abazia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with whom Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories already a month ago.
"We have made two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important is that dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU" - Alexandre Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains, despite the fact that "the power was afraid in this parliament which has no weight, to bring even one opponent in".
The opposition does not include protest actions in the light of results, but rather attempts to send its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concern on this side: we need to have our opposing newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities put us on wheels for broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting elections, even in the circle of older people" - said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported retirees does not really consider it appropriate anymore.
"Because of the debt of the country and the rise in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'recalling the silence of a cemetery', is no more than a matter of time," says Milinkevitch.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have qualified democratic elections.
Serguei Lebedev, the head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." Thus, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had no rotating doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is in force against little machines, against which it points and will then drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
Today, the anti-farmer novelty was presented by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The turning doors- says Brunetta- are a tool for better working, with more productivity, more presences and more services," the Minister said.
Now a new season of accountability and transparency begins.
"It's about reformism," says Brunetta.
The installation in all institutions of the Council Presidency is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is even important from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been registered, the Secretary General says: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or increasing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and safe resolution".
At a lecture at the Superior School of the Public Administration
in Rome, the minister communicates that "in three months, the absences of illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand workers more than a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "including wage dynamics- explains the Minister- over the past 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and well beyond inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined in challenging the standards of Decree Brunetta using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today spreads data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness- written the association of consumers- the people of "active farmers" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive Public Administration met to declare the war to the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of disability due to service is challenged; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's home stay, during which inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents on the workplace, Napolitano: "Criminal prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain disabled permanently.
In 2007, the Inail data confirmed that the white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that demonstrate the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and cause almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
For the attention of the institutions, social forces and means of information on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of the Victims of Accidents on Labour, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"Anmil's worrying data, as well as the tragic events of the past few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention at work," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the ongoing associative effort to prevent accidents at work, to protect injured workers, to assist victims' families and to raise awareness of public opinion."
"naturally unworthy, everyone has struck the fist to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repeatative cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, our attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed how much "this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each one of us, and requires all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data of the workers appear to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being even impressive," said the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"we do not wish that this "tendence to the discount" actually translates into minor attention, because it is just when the attention relaxes, that the tragedy comes.
"we believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be made through multiple actions."
"As noted by Mercandelli - more controls and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added - "There is still a need to make an effort to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, a greater sense of employers' responsibilities in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Comandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the expected compensation for victims of work" and the "development of assistance to which the system has been oriented in recent years."
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - so that the fate of the one who has an accident should not depend on the spontaneousity or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 player pointed at the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent damage to the hearing.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a press release in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Cssseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report - let us read in the note that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to scientific data, it is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise awareness of consumers and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in view of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels called on the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"The scientists-conclude the EU-executive confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European security standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but the concern increases as to hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reduction of levels and length of noise exposure.
The Scientific Committee Ue notes that users of portable musical devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, are above the current limits on the maximum noise level agreed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions during prolonged periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at about 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germano gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we begin today, in March we finish, in June we will draw our own.
This is the timetable set by the Chapter for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Thermes de Carcalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will develop the Directives for Rome.
In March when they are completed, the Committee and the Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the " official stamp " of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it, and it would like to stress that Germano should propose ideas for development in Rome, which can be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, she will have finished her duties and will then disappear, as this experience must have a precise temporal duration.
In June-announcing the mayor, we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work of the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its views will not be binding, Germano replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France, thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am on it, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often the policy is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see ahead, and further, towards a deeper prospective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome would like to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic assembly: it is absolutely free of charge, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligences that express Capital.
For Germano, in fact, "it takes a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immovable, in order to enable our city, to improve itself, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit."
A future which, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who tends to be independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the other hand, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he always has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of elections approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is really hot: he thinks he will gain the highest function of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In reality, these are attacks that don't say much; they are of course racial attacks, and they don't answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have polls, all of them saying that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who talks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the depths of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know well who the American patriot will give his vote.
This is what emerges from an aspect of American mentality kept secret to the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things have never been revealed so far, so much so that the black candidate's success seems almost certain.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the errors made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent home with kicks.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, most of Iraq was Bush's weakness.
Who will take George W's place will have a huge stain to accomplish.
Usa, the economic decay is even felt among journalists: in the press, it is time for deletions. And many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists were asked by the POW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are pessimistic today about their future.
However, they have not openly stated to information officers, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem of American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is an economic model crisis destroyed.
In addition, deletions in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work at the newspaper assembly, are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is to be seen as the general public is concerned, it is not to be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don't have a hard time seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses were taking a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as the "murder" of the newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increasing to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest crunch in American journalism lies between those who run newsrooms - i.e. directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage decreases to 23%.
For some, this is related to "working safety".
The directors who plan to lose their jobs in the 3 year period are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we go to 30%.
The one of the "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a question to take or leave.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years.
But according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPLA IS STILL THE GOTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bank route as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation instruction.
During his trial last week, he had been granted the forced release of his home in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the city to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such travels (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already occurred a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the 700 billion-dollar rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and it is, even more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the American economy.
And it is indeed the New York Times of yesterday that confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its vigour East Coast, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the Washington ones" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, rightly, which became unscrupulously felt with the vote I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just one example of the changes, the major changes that the current economic earthquake announced or already lets it run: not only the United States, but throughout the West, and it can be only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomenon that has been covered for some time, so that in the new climate they are solidified and revealed.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, extraordinary revival, of the dual sovereign state category, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with the outside world, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for which he governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalization seems to be out of play or not, it has little to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide any common political lines.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit affection: when we go through a difficult period, there are only those States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of priceless value, elements that no international market or organization can ever have in the same way.
This new emphasis of the state-of-the-nation crisis is still in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, when we were now convinced that we had entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-materials, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized once and for all that our future would have to settle its accounts more and more with rather little material things such as water, crops and oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but that are absolutely related to a confined space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is, the one who has the evilness of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I am now coming to the second novelty, which however provides for a fracture.
Who says Territoire, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And also, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the whole class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
This increases even further the conviction of the various classes, before actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having the same time, and becoming increasingly alien to the views of the majority.
in short, The demand for leadership, undergroundly nurtures a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "revolts" or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter all the time, from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of workers in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not happen by chance).
It seems that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectual accreditations, their format, it seems, are still more difficult, which does not date today, to understand and thus to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis reinforces, increases and shakes potentially in a measured way.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda seems to be quite exaggerated.
But it's good to say, keep your eyes wide open, that's not without reason.
The superneck to walk on the walls.
Conquer the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to maintain a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The ETUDE- The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a specific carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by geckos' legs, covered with microscopic hairs that make it possible to ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Téflon, and glass paper, have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that "it easily separates itself from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering.
MARKET ON WOMEN? –"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Limiting Dai.
Could it be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since the nano carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive made up of microfibres such as hair, which self cleanses dust during movement on a surface to ensure a perfect and constant adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juice.
Attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, mostly consumed in the summer as desaliterant and vitamin-rich, if associated with certain vital drugs, alter the absorption of these drinks, which amplifying or diminishing depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices whether they are in box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apples juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, canceling their beneficial effects and endangering patients' health.
Pamplemous juice has already been strongly criticized because it considers it responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotics, anxiolytics, anti staminal and neurological medicinal products up to toxic levels.
Medicines A RISQUE- It is the Italian Medicines Agency itself, who gave the news in a two-year information bulletin, warning doctors and patients not to assess the danger of this mix and to ensure that you drink, if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the Université Publique de Milan: "These findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always appropriate to read the indicative papers of the medicines taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to be clearly addressed to the doctor or pharmacist," said the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel in Economics in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a New Kenyan who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's foreign economic and political solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks in the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that triggered many controversy, and was blamed on the economist for years, but which has now proved accurate.
"I am surprised and even a bit shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive "style divulner", particularly critical to the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of OpenOffice.org.3.0 broadcast, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to touch more and more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following almost a year's work, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows itself to the general public with various new features: welcome screen, and the revised interface and become less austere, others more important, such as the compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to interaction with Office 2007 and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format chart with elements of a spreadsheet or text maker.
Collaboration between several people has been an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the development of texts, because each employee is assigned a colour of comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to carry out certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should deliver the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation code may be shipped at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of freeness can be a means to spread it in homes, it is precisely in business, that Open Office then faces the big challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Write, for Word equivalent writing video; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Print, for PowerPoint rival presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008 to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, you can even exceed the forecast figure.
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber's jersey.
It is the site of the daily The Team that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italian Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests on Kohl specimens are part of those performed in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to hope for two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press, that he had notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus sharpening the peas jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES: NEW YORK TIMES IS REQUESTED IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as an immigrant country has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Would this turn the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times has dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where we register "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support to the Northern Lega"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislation required by the League to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal persons is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Trend highlighted by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked for the state and the Church to work together to overcome racism."
Student victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market is not aware of the crisis
According to Sunia's last survey, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 euros in Naples, 600 euros in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding the whole categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high global costs that families of origin must support - explained the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand of students has distorted the market so that a process of generalized increase has even begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a number of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, no rent limit, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax taxation are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes approximately 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Black Band area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), approximately 600 euros are required for a single, 450 for a double bed.
slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you move away to the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple one in the Predestina, Centocella or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, you must count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rents are often taken by extra-Community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent requested by foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Adieu old cinema Paradiso, the cities eliminate historic halls.
Historical cinemas close in favour of multiplexes.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore well illustrates what is happening in the large Italian urban centers, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of the large multi-sales, and the death of consumption of mono rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems to us to be inescapable and unquestionable; in addition, it has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and are charged with memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of road and so many emotions" observes the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, which offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and who told the poetry of a province hall, and nostalgia in a way to live the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that paid the costs mainly: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is headed by 82 single cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirming that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, as it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multialle cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally" said Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should nevertheless guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a living room in a city, these visitors are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of credit for traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between €16 million and €18 million per year is needed.
We note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of these types in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono rooms of historic and peripheral centers.
The proposed regulations include measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and parking.
"It is an initiative that pleases" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is clear, however, that in order to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" to which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much shared emotions, I turn from the other side to not see the black panels through the dust.
Links between politics and ‘drangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to standardize the mayor's choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
serious accusations are made by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabre, to the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrion, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The handcuffs also for Gioaccino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his young lawyer son, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"a fight against legal and moral norms, and above all common sense" wrote the prosecutors, both local governments had expressed the desire to pay for consultations with Master Piromalli.
"So we would have been given to the clan - writing the judges - to officially enter within the municipalities facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian Regional Committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "colossies between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of drangheta, heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrest follows last July, after which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April, the communal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was appointed head of a right-centre coalition after the May 2006 ballotage.
He called the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He accused the deputy minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, the accused of handling everything for a political issue, but in view of the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in demanding the variation of the project of the A3.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Pyromalli, harmonizing the choice of public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy comes from waves, the big ones are now launching.
This is a stocked deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now major global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossus like Chevron have set their eyes, and now they're trying to get their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When oil prices dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the ecological authorities and the new increase in oil give rise to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 estimated that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by offshore mining systems.
This would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colosses to the attack.
The first marine energy company was the Energysis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, we would have said a true revolutionary step.
At two years of this, more and more candidates among those companies that have always been dedicated to traditional energy focus on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said the spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil colossus, the Wall Street Journal, and it assesses opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit deliberated by the US Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that just in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travel the route of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested so far, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology at its beginning, on the other hand, the fact that marine energy does not dispel fear of environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major problem in the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technology needs to be used with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the mud upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through cables under the sea.
For now, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking space using six marine turbines from the East River of New York.
The movement of water at tides, rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced to have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, now deserves the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely about the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, invested $7 million and half dollars in 2008 and plan investments up to 35 million in 2009.
