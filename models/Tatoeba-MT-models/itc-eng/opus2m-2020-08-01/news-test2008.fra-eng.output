Inflation in Europe has taken over food
Rapid inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than the forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community statistics office in Luxembourg reported.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, Bloomberg reported.
Contrary to the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the rate of direct interest by saying that lower interest rates, with higher commodity prices and lower unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB that "inflation must be deterred" so as not to have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain, it is increased from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off because of the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
Cereal market shares have increased by 88 per cent and the soybean price has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 per cent and last month, a black gold barrel cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will fall from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009, it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, the next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the Governing Rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (The Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly in early December. Thus, since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Study Institute) has never previously found such low socialist support, 13 percent.
For faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greatest determination of the opposition voters, more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of one fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and SZDSZ (Allies of Free Democrats) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent throughout the population.
On the faithful voters some to go to vote, the number of supporters of the two parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous lower point, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been as high, rose to 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent, the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of spring and summer last, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population is forecasting an increase and only one tenth is forecasting an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 per cent of respondents, a majority never seen in Gallup's previous polls, felt that the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of polls have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 per cent the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of changing the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be treated without change of government.
While 35 per cent of the polls were after last October's riots, 35 per cent of the polls hoped that the government and the Prime Minister would remain in office, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of voting intent, 60 per cent of respondents replied that they would certainly vote and the additional 20 per cent said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the polls would certainly participate and 15 per cent additional would probably be involved. Following the current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would make no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to higher education registration fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and travel costs to the hospital.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
Hypermarkets in Budaörs' commercial triangle maintained an average price increase of 16% last year compared with the fact that this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Article of Napi Gazdaság (Day Economy)
This year, in the trade triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, an increase of significantly higher than a thousand forts in all hypermarkets.
The prices, 'which had already flown' in the large food stores last December, did not increase sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are, of course, shocked to see that the items purchased clearly below nine thousand forks last year now cost more than ten thousand forks.
The daily basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded at least 91 forints, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value in the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6 800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the prices of turkey net, nuts and peacocks have increased considerably.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, we found bread from one kilo to only 139 forints.
Competition has not lowered the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle contained in two liters of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the bottle included.
This year, in terms of daily shopping, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased its daily basket price by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the cheapest basket of last year and the cheapest basket of this year, we find a difference of 12 percent while the difference between the lowest basket of last year and the most expensive basket of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate had already been noted in last year's Christmas prices.
This process caused trade to be perplexed, and hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply on products so far they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a merchant miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was higher than the value of the 2006 basket, while the difference between the least expensive baskets was only 844.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the basket was higher than that of last year and the prices at least increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumption items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some essential foods, the Institute of Statistics has seen an increase in prices by more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the daily Cartier of the latter, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, already quite expensive last year, has just increased by just over 10 per cent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a higher position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in making the brutal price increase accepted by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-containing food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important tails formed in the boxes of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overuse of medical personnel do not help block infections, says the chief doctor at the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also make the economy on disinfectants
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed with trauma at János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured person from a serious car accident left the hospital but soon after he had to return there because of an MRSA infection and since then doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
That is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by methicillin-oxacilline-resistant gold staphylococcus.
One third of the people are carriers of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SAs (such as anginas, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily healing.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is well resistant to antibiotics that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged functioning of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on the elderly, low weight or weakened organism.
According to the hospital director János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily routine of hospitals.
Above all, one should not confuse infection with the epidemic, one cannot find MRSA only the one or not looking for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the caretakers put gloves in rubber and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable to cure them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in mode
While the vast majority of MRSA infections may be prevented, current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It is important to know that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these reviews.
Most cases can only be seen if the MSSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief doctor at the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
The realization of microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put gloves and masks of protection. However, important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, contaminated patients may not always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, the patients should be kept away from each other at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable way or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenditures for social security funds, which is why we are fighting against this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the impact of CIHR.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who was responsible for a fatal accident, was not in a state of drinking
The official finding on the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was prepared.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his position since, who has crushed a pedestrian by causing his death on Tuesday, would have led to drunk or etourdi, communicated Friday, Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Ministry of the Capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before flying.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd arrondissement department crushed a 55-year-old man who stood before him when he turned, with his personal car, on Kossuth Lajos Street, 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian passage.
(In addition, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian passage does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Code of the Road a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and applied for retirement because, according to the police, he was greatly disturbed by this accident.
The investigation of this case is conducted by the Budapest Investigations Department.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements of a total value of EUR 400 million in Budapest on a credit line to support education, transport infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund with a loan contract of EUR 100 million already signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary and the remaining EUR 150 million will be used later following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a EUR 50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope first as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the Metro Line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would reconsider the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary completed the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, EU Real Estate Market Paradise
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans not mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys on this EU market that is always the least expensive but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the shores of the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sables", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly searching for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also increasing to buy in the very cheap corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade and office surfaces promising the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors already buy large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are also looking to change their life, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, called Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle are buying renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or from old delabated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes the buyers of secondary residences (since December, Bulgaria is listed among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who buy in hopes of achieving a medium or long-term value added.
The price of capital buildings is rising steadily as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last five years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and six percent Hungarian
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, the meetings of professionals end on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, lively discussions are being held between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not wish to discuss accurate figures, but were prepared to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another important aspect of the conference is whether developed countries undertake, without reducing emissions, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund set out in the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors likely under the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as admiral ship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the "After 2012 Agreement", and was ready to reduce them by 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments appropriate to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time had made a commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The issue is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be established within the two-year period, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be rejected after 2012. In this case, commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new international emission reduction system, the necessity of which was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for Climate Change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average Earth temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
The British army units report on the video sharing site records made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with a view to becoming popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) who was passionate about YouTube: the special units involved in Afghanistan are responsible for video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the headquarters of the air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to Londres or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence entered under the name "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and reported videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial target of the air force, the videos were passed over the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make known to the general public the actual objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published by this route costs practically nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, to be communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message, since it justifies in a special form the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans played a game
The army is jealous because, apart from the carefully composed and censured videos, amateur videos have been passed on to the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In addition, many videos had already been broadcast on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army had only been packed for the loading of these videos recently.
Americans are recruiting a little differently by using America's Army Downloadable Shooting Game for free. In this game the player can put himself directly to the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas Tombola and Beignets in the Ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking drinks and coffee.
Another department will organize a party with live music, another will delight public servants with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas ambience, concerts and buffet, so the power is fun.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas celebration will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the department's employees who will be invited.
At Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides a budget of 25 million forks to create the end-of-year environment.
Compared to other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will feast.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this feast, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forensics and was organized on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice building (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party that is organised with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, a bid manager company.
The Gaîte Theatre building has been rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the person responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of St. Luke on December 7.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
This dance had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcoming words and dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: evening keeping was not at all mandatory at this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Authorities are preparing an over-the-counter party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forks.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, does not formally invite his employees to a Christmas party but to an end-of-year working meeting.
A hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and a meal, provided the press service, the party will not cost as much as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his employees to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Authorities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas party in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It is expected to spend 2,500 forks per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No planned holiday atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the hour of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, Christmas Day will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the Department's communication, 1,000 forks per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few welcoming words from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate at all for Christmas, communicated the respective press services to [origo].
The press department of the Ministry of the Environment was not aware of the price of the official Christmas festival.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The Forces of the Mega Strike Gather
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will be their strike commission on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the indeterminate Monday strike.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause important traffic stops as rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and employees of BKV (common transport society) will also strike until 13 hours.
The Unions of the League will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike commission will also be set up and will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the Health Fund Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on further action.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, voting on the Health Fund Act is likely to take place only late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike planned for Monday, important stops are planned in traffic: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the common transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are likely to be stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will be blocked as well.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strike, and the list of trade unions is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report the strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary termination of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ) have failed to reach agreement on minimum services, or, near Christmas parties, more and more are those taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., the Budapest airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Professors' Democratic Union called for a strike for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike all over the country on an alternate basis, the Health and Social Sector Employees' Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League requires that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculation of retirement to be established from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim wants a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the system to pass the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the release by the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ), linked to the League Trade Unions, the proposal of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport on secondary rail lines and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarszágért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the company notes that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "in the short term aggressive ethnic confrontations can occur as a result of the escalation of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Tzigan population of Hungary."
The research institute has added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy to likely provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of the Hungarian political actors: "public actors have given public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians."
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened, and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular on confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country."
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer of 2007 as "national self-defense association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their members to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, further, by referring to the inability of the police, the army, i.e. the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was going on in accordance with the method that, based on the retaliation of the political society and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil way.
The emphasis on civil character and association status is therefore only used to avoid the legal traps of registration of these associations in the court but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighbouring relationships.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a source of potential risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma disorders that have exploded in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, UNB decided to set up a guard saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defence".
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the formation of their own guard as a resistance points to the increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude the Hungarian Roma from reacting to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of information from the Telegraphic Agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the parties, it has become common to reorganize the working days of which the number will decrease next year.
Celebrations are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays and rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also rest days, especially so that awakeners can rest quietly.
In addition, in a year, we have in all eleven red parties.
March 15 is a national festival, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as on October 23 as well as the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1 is the work party and November 1 and 2, we remember our family members and our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases or only one working day before or after the party marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in particular on days of replacement of days before or after parties.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions that are constantly turning and in service, through their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end-of-the-year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost throughout the country because according to experience most people do rather overtime or take vacations they have saved for these purposes to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
The next year, many parties fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The schedule will be reorganized the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay at home four days of affiliate.
Saturday, April 25, will be a day of work for a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year's day falls on a Wednesday.
Six foolish things that can be terribly annoying to colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost further annoy us: these are things that "pretty" the daily routine of a place of work.
The question is whether we are accustomed to these problems or we are facing the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called marketing service," said one colleague.
Did you miss an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them he forgot to pass the message (that is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
You remember the night before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking if they're right to be angry with you for biting on their property.
Don't wear envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there is no more and you need them right away.
Are you a partner in the privacy of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop the spills.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (suppositions) about your colleagues' privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you declaring yourself sick without reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick on the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, think that your work, your urgent business, your missions must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or something can happen that will force you to stay at home, don't forget to warn your boss and your colleagues so they won't be surprised about your absence the next day.
Refrigeration, winding, telephone
You're plunged into your work but your colleagues' blackmailed you out of it?
You've become, without wanting, a witness to a phone discussion that you'd better not listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with colds, singing, loud discussions (which you carry over their heads), footbeats, big words or discontent expressed loudly.
They may interfere even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed deadline, you forget to send an important mail or message, don't accuse anyone for that forgetting!
Don't put it on the account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Admit it if you have made a mistake and if it has made some disadvantages for others, repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault, repair neglect!
Are you feeling too at home at the office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't suit the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not forget, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by wearing nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting
We're moving slowly into the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm soundin'.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tones of the whole hour, then a female choir joins it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcast Zagar's Wings of Love song.
The Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with a good-quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap is different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new style of the garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zsager arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he launched himself on his own way, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dancing and pop music, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the recorded soundtracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
The early training in small clubs began to be known by a greater audience when the magazine won2 cited their first album of 2002 among the 50 largest records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive to the west.
Zagar and his ensemble became unquestionably "tready" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group reacted the right way, he released a new and better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new ways for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Pécs de Balázs Zsager.
We are there well with reference to flight but next to air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, which has recently spread popular music from morning to evening, started to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian songs ("Underground Divas").
It's all right, then (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: did your music remain a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term for music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
Music is said to be alternatives, underground can also be poor and made only to sell them and become so commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit irrespective of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is either more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially west light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people from a decade or twenty years old but also older ones.
They follow much more closely the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course I am happy to see that people are increasingly coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve an objective but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence already works but is perceived only in the inseparable changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you wouldn't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has been a career rather west.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his path even though some sometimes try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust each other's musical presence and let them deploy themselves.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music was compared to that of Yonderboi because there were many of us leaving his group and taking another path.
hvg.hu: On the palm tree of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many have heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style have you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube so we could sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it at the end of the album to try to soften the pride of sounds and the most difficult themes addressed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea of composing this choral of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The six-member choir was composed of Sena, Edina Kutzora, Jude Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, who was later baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This piece already existed in an instrumental version for a long time and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing in this song.
The sequence of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang at night even the melody girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me back then, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of Judy Jay's solo brief), they don't have a role alone, they sing all together and they don't sing louder than music, so music just accompanies their song.
They were behind the stage too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego a little, forget that comes from where, who goes or, just let these wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted others to also feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs has made you the most work?
Zs.B.: Actually, nothing about the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, little by little, everything started out like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and because I've already "left" this disc.
Right now, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader has a risk of billions because of its inferiority complex
A covert fraudster.
Thus his former employee the French giant the Société General, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost EUR 5 billion because of it.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be regarded as incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he acknowledged in time the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
"He's fragile," his superiors said to the police.
However, in keeping with Kerviel's statement by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions have produced a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis goes beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the deposition.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a million euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "subprime" mortgages granted to low-income customers or those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides, adding that, of course, he didn't keep anything kept for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses that he has forged the reports so as not to be removed.
He managed to dupe his superiors, although the Eureka stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything
Was he afraid to be discovered?
Rather not.
"I thought the simple fact that I got 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did his will come from to risk so much?
He reached his position only gradually.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after he finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and in 2005 he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
With regard to my university course and my career and personal career course," said investigators Kerviel.
But soon after he joined the office, he won his first major success.
Thanks to Allianz' actions, he won half a million euros by putting down this title during the Londrès attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
"There was like a snowball effect," he said to the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
But that's when the blow from the beginning of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to cover the amount.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took 4 days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Czechia on the occasion of obtaining 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government Ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could in the coming years bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount Czechia can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that can be obtained by the Czech Republic as part of these projects.
This money will result in an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme for SMEs and entrepreneurs should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
Later, however, he was released and resided in his tenenda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, based between 1997 and 2002, will be re-incarcerated for the time being, according to the AP agency, not clear.
According to the President of the Ileana Pérez Court of Appeal, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will let Germany finish his sentence at home, or he will again be in prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Germany regularly moved government money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
They were fictitious societies and the accounts actually belonged to the members of his family and to his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that German had created to fund its election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority of governments without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year spent a year thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since Sobotka had been prepared and ČSSD could not afford to refuse.
Contrary to the heated debate before the vote of the declaration of defiance to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted without any problem this law, which, although most influential, is usually neglected.
This is kind of a paradox.
Whether you want it or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although it is hidden behind the competition of power against government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive on the media and that is why he is given more attention in the media.
The debates of the politicians are more of a concern to the opinion than to the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three shortcomings that the current budget is not able to settle at the same time:
The first being the important share of the legal mandate costs, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" bringing together the parties ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit in the state budget that represents the greatest ally.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The real late bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued obligations, borrowing their municipalities disproportionately, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they were able to repay these debts by the mass sale of shares of distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatization.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only official and verifiable facts are dealt with, it is found that:
Our economy has already been going through for many years, just like the rest of the world, a growth phase and ČSSD does not lack to sell.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they became increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their business in a much more reasonable way than our Republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls primarily on previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
We therefore do not need any massive social programmes that have been unfortunately unnecessarily inflated in the past few years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending has been eliminated, approved last year before the elections, if a deviation from the retirement age limit and a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever will be in power, it will only be administered.
By simply exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats by mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism which makes ordinary costs repulsed by the costs of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if previous governments had not disposed of all the money they could.
If we really do not want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what it does to collect tax and tax duties, the necessary calm to prepare new reform laws.
There are only those who will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to jointly combat the financial market crisis.
More than a hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
As an example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to auctions and, in addition, will provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks on 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided on a concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl in his report to clients of the Economic Outlook Group consulting company.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," adds Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unrefunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still be pursued," said the Chief Economist of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
The Central Banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect economic growth worldwide.
The Central Banks made this choice after failure to reduce the interbank rate of Londres, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks always feared mutual loans, even though the US, Canadian and English Central Banks had repeatedly decreased their interest rates during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a new decline in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio agency of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks approach will help to overcome the crisis, since it does not address the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the USA.
President Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is supposed to harm especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
This time, criticism has been expressed at the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change, ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of Governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetorical companion and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a rocket of words, ersaz from solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, in the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he commits himself to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since he said, "I often find only the caricature of my opinions".
Now interested people can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that, although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless felt that he had enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic capable of monitoring and evaluating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics, and he is also an economist.
The main findings of the book are, he said, the following: the climate is constantly evolving, the changes of the book are normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they represent no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, inefficient and unacceptablely costly.
Especially since he had the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considered it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he felt was a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he explained on several occasions that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving licenses in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their former driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still request renewal, so that the authorities can issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permits will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licenses especially those who no longer want to drive.
While communes report a decrease in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are overrun with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The City Hall meets approximately 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licenses.
The issuance of a new licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for release within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver shall pay an additional of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to complete the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and we will take the road without a valid permit, will be subject to a fine from January.
The culprit will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to old information, he was liable to a fine even a person who was not going to circulate.
By doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and to impose fines not exceeding 1000 kroner.
However, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
It is not like with the identity card which, she, must be valid without exception.
Persons who no longer want to drive should return their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to progressively renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of detectives with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of conniving with the David Berdych gang, respectively, will be 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Prague High Court has therefore sentenced them permanently by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Initially, detectives from the Department for Combating Organized Crime were at risk of 14 and 12 years of imprisonment.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgement, only one appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he does not wait until now for the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already received more than 16 years of imprisonment in other trials.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found guilty for participation in 19 holding-ups, and today the Supreme Court dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the defendants questioned the charge by claiming that it was a handled case.
According to the Central Bohème Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement, inter alia with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang returned 30 percent of the larcin to Opava and Koňařík.
In the prosecution there is a question of the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robbery, in most cases, has suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the power of a public agent and prohibited armament.
During home searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a laser direct shooter or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from some 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other handlifting thefts Berdych and a whole series of other people.
Other men from the neighborhood of Berdych are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived to the court.
The main hearing has at the moment avoided Tomáš Pŏta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
Child replacement price: 12 million
Lawyer Igor Veleba wants to obtain compensation from Třebíč hospital for 12 million crowns plus costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at the Ondřej Dostál hospital is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party ordered the drafting.
We'll check if this one has some explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
The amount should, according to him, be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the university hospital in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better sustained by men, although they have been faced with remorse for not knowing how to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, they remain less serene in the face of trauma in the present and in the current situation, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at Třebíč Hospital on 9 December.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at Čermák in Přibyslave and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The Governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil gave to each of the 100,000 Crown families for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czechia are forced by law into civil liability insurance.
In the event of a breach, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
Until now, the courts have acknowledged relatively little compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables were about hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Královstvi (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the brand Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, he had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic about Bolek Polívka's popularity," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words Valašsko Kingdom evoke this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's a nearly ten-year job behind us.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could benefit from it.
They want to parasite our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the Valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in its television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had nothing to do with the project of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of making passports of Valašské Království appear.
From a humorous action at the beginning there was a business and a lucrative business, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that its name and signature are listed in the passport and even offered to the holders of the balances on the price of the visit of its farm and its theatre shows.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the nue idea, published by Polívka in the Manéž show for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to the project intensely.
The collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polyvka an official coronation in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, who culminated with the deposition "of the first king elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under Harabiš's inspiration, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, requesting that the court today reject.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half the princess.
He's supposed to be a new king.
He did not yet want to betray the details and the date.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the King's parade in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register," added Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and also that of manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as being inferior to the average.
However, his successor, Peugeot 207, is now on the market, which is much better.
Especially since the combo named SW is still going a step further, I just have to think about it better.
When I tested the classic hatback of the Peugeot 207 I complained about space for the head on the back seats.
As you finish the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's see quickly.
I'm going to mention the interior very quickly so I won't be over and over again.
This is a very successful design, my only remark on the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a more inventive design, as the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about seats or too short folders is revolted.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is also sensitive here.
The combi also sees the lack of room above the head mentioned above disappear.
A box in the box
The most important thing about this vehicle is therefore its luggage rack.
I have to evaluate this as very accessible (also thanks to the back pivoting ice) and a rather easy frame.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being capable of holding rather heavy objects.
But let's stop us in the volume.
It makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to competition.
Apart from Škoda Fabiana Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czechia.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we see that the Peugeot remains very sensitively behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to leaving abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But if I had to point out the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the box remaining after the reverse of the back seats files perfectly right, or a very low walkway.
120 horses distributed over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with an Otto engine of four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hitchback work.
He is quiet, he consumes little and, above all, he grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the impression of having an escape pot blocked by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Travel rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 liter engine of 329 900 Kč is still valid.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
However, we have also available head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic mirror wiper, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the 531 900 Kč account.
That's a lot, but try to add extra equipment to Fabian's price and you'll get a very similar figure.
So there's only one left to choose the mark.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is a problem
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which causes concern among residents about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of people of origin turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where there are beginning to be major conflicts between residents and immigrants of Slovak origin, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The fights, chicane and fights between students have moved into the relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was hitting a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends himself by claiming that the boy insulted him by racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant conducted by two adolescents.
The young girls allegedly addressed him with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a young man climbed over the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered by apples and pears and then discovered his buttocks," he described another unpleasant adventure of a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went so far as to qualify conflicts with immigrants to fight for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between residents of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
All you expect from your leave can happen if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you a pizza, ice or intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will find this list not only in its entirety but also enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the deposit and transhipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was built at the beginning of the 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the U.S. Mafia, who had it built, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its clients were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950's, circulated on the large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of the entire American business show and political men left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave yourself your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita de la Havana.
In the bar of the National Hotel, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed with the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars always travel to Havana, since the jigoulis and the previously imported fiats have long been in such a salty and wet climate, rotting.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are so many splendid colonial monuments that there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green fire.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have not only moved to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of Holguín Province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique to the world and that will be appreciated especially by those who love small trains.
The cane had been brought back from the plantations extended into the sugar plantations on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for dozens of years and this is how we can see small locomotives that are not just in museums.
Where are you headed?
Most visitors do not miss the best known places.
So there's no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise remember that in Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation grows on a limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks climb into candles from the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile soil caught in their guts, even their rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is where Cuban tobacco is likely to be grown of the best quality.
You can meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
Someone might also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It is the trade of slaves and that of sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beauty and character of this small city.
Koloniální španělská architektura, výrazně ovlivněná pondějšími francuzskými osadníky, if čtyři staletí teměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the massive Escambray, is a place so far away that in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their heads.
If we have more time than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth going to see interesting places in the surroundings as well, such as Playa Ancón Beach or Sucre Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which is excited after sunset and where music is only sweaty in the morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads there.
The two roads that drive there from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross an almost unmarked landscape of human activity.
UNESCO has placed the East of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
There is the best chocolate, at the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after the pilgrimage of Colomb) and from the hill where the old castle is held and the current El Castillo hotel, we see several Table Mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Truies and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropical cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a number of pages.
Only, as you rightly say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, American claims
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment affects, according to the United States, the progress of the mission to Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not going to take place as it should, and representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country have agreed to Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to the growing challenge by the Taliban movement, the eight States involved today are also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States has called NATO troops through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates this week for greater activity, Britain sees the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the intensification of development assistance as a priority.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is noticeable, but the military power can be only part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants themselves to start a new development of the economy and security," said BBC to the British Defence Minister Des Browne.
Ninety-ten percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to data from the U.S. Army, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in the Helmand province, south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the south.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
The Secretary-General of NATO Jaap of Hoop today made similar remarks.
"I'm not happy about what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters agency at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that would last three days.
Which is passive
The last few months are also among the countries involved in conflicts on the issue if all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its liabilities.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as rigorous as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"The wealthy Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," wrote Sun in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on a counter-attack by posting a photo of a British troop during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to one billion in 2009
The charge of a debt of the State exceeding 84,000 kroner is chargeable to each Czech.
The total debt was raised, at the end of September, to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
As a result of improved government budget savings, the department has reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The debt of the Czech Republic state rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year it has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, however, it has declined by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the government's debt since the beginning of October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84,000 kroner falls on each Czech.
Over the past year, the state lost more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, one could cross the border of one trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the billion in the year 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed by 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State is the debt of the central government and is mainly caused by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The debt of the State is financed by treasury bonds, pension securities, direct borrowings or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
This year's domestic debt has increased from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached at the end of September 803.3 billion kroner and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average debt requirement of the State was 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased from the first to the third half of 13 per cent on an annual basis, which is, in view of the current health of the economy, too high.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the pension securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be room for negotiation when pension reform comes," Pikora commented.
Better than what was expected
As a result of the Government's 2007 debt financing and management strategy, the government planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected government budget, the department reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion kroner.
The sum consists mainly of the government budget deficit, which clearly amounts to 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the initially planned 91.3 billion crowns.
Next, these are the maximum sources for the Czech consolidation agency, namely 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pension securities for 43 billion crowns and the repayments of the European Investment Bank's loans amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
She was comparing today before a court in Khartoum for having appointed a bear in a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to Thursday night by a Khartoum court at 15 days' imprisonment and expulsion, his lawyer said.
The British was accused of having left students aged 6-7 giving the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to whipping.
This 54-year-old British teacher in charge of the Unity High School in Khartoum in the Sudan was arrested on Sunday and charged with attacking Islam and indicting, pursuant to article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students with the Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any labels with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said, "innocent error".
Opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Let's remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second name most often given in Britain, he writes English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, an issue of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion meeting on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without overcoming their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach agreement on the status," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence immediately, but we enter a very difficult time," he added, pointing out, "evident tensions exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which comprise the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated with 90% of albanophones could become clearer when ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will report back to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika was responsible for further mediation by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on further negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of EU administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council did not agree in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found", announced the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where these " last chance negotiations had been held since Monday."
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that Belgrade's autonomous plan "belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, considered that a compromise was still possible, cautioning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said, in particular, to redouble a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the 1990s' wars of independence.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the delegation of Serbia had insisted that any decision should return exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
“Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end up as they began: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu said that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers would be "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush breaks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference held by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to engage immediately in negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties to their obligations under the "roadmap" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The leader of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This appellation covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the President of the United States, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations should be "global and comprehensive" and cover all aspects of a settlement, including "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security."
In turn, Olmert committed himself to making future talks "direct and continuous" and to making "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush established at the end of 2008 the deadline for implementing its "two-State vision" of Palestinian and Israeli co-existence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment in that direction to Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, is the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saud in his interview with the daily Arab-speaking Saudi capital.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As in each case in this different type of fact, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN) survey, a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but in patrol, and was traveling 40-50 km/h, without gyro", explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, therefore not allowed to travel on the public road" (read below) and piloted by two young people without helmets, circulated "to very bright allure".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a right-wing refusal," said one police officer.
The control of alcoholism on the occupants of the vehicle has proved negative.
The state of the car (before release, star windshield, shockshield) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Therère de Givry, announced that he had commissioned an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assisted persons at risk" at the IGPN, with the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation at this stage was dissociating the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a sort of scratch, probably caused by the friction of the pedestrians on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained in the loop as long as the police car was able to brake.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor soon circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have quickly left the places, thus not providing any help to the two young people.
The GNP, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "all serious misconduct" on this point.
"This is one aspect of the most difficult investigation, which requires more investigations, on which to be very careful," said a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness of these few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows specifically on the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to get them back, this witness says.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a completely ferred cop, who was boxing.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth was on the phone."
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently the certainty that the people present of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
Always according to this witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let you say that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been taken care of.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
Tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, approximately 2,000 lawyers protesting against emergency measures were injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement forces, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been requested.
Similar scenarios to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers have charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other events would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (north-west).
On Monday, the lawyer movement gathered the support of the religious parties grouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president '' exhorted the people to send flowers to the judges who pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and debris to those who took oath before Musharraf'.
'' Musharraf's promise no longer holds'
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly covered by the exception measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, it was expected that President Musharraf's indirect vote on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections would take place on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
''All that we are witnessing is illegal, anti-institutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's judgments,' said the magistrate in The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president "is no longer valid" after the state of emergency was established, said the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned residence by his Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces.
Over one third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
Today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not expected, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
However, the liberalization of contraception has allowed a better "control of fertility", according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
See calculated next month for a couple of five and if possible in spring, season considered as the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It would have taken more than seven hours to work in space at astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel, which is essential to the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that has accumulated records due to its length, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the astronauts' "bricked" tools to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday as astronauts unloaded Discovery's shuttle from the Harmony module, a large cylindrical room for European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of docking dock for the processing modules.
But we must be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a solar panel power generation module weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, to position it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the re-deployment of the module's solar panels with a size of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, has been damaged about one meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to carry out a check-out of the Discovery shuttle, then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracle at the end of the 30 meters long of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space marketer) of the Nasa.
Large, durable, very appropriate, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this training physician was responsible for operating the "injured" solar panel.
After specifically inspecting the damage, he sectioned the wrong cable and installed kinds of "attacks" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" stayed near his own and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-cooked insulating hockey tube to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricked" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying its tools and returning the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day's relaxation before today, seven astronauts did not return the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in the Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently falling sharply at the Paris stock exchange, after the aviation and defence group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion in order to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its operational outcome forecast for 2007 as a result of the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of covering the delay in delivering its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is 'EUR 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus', announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result objectives (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results on Thursday, without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operating result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned for the first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension, Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very blocked campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a television message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of a united Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is said to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President left nothing to be seen by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of preference during the campaign.
"We know the prize of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections without hanging," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from it.
It denounces a pressure campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says that there was "never such a dirty election, even in Eltsine's time."
After the repression of last weekend's protests, former chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the sovieticus homo"
Behind these non-suspendant legislatures are two issues that are much more open:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the first round of the presidential on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot fight a third consecutive mandate.
But no successors emerge.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The head of the parliamentary majority and the powerful united Russian party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both the legislative and the presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mindset of the sovieticus homo, they do not feel master of their destiny," says Sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada independent centre.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes on to say: civil society has slowed down in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has slowed down the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutin has renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "responsibly renounced personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"What's it good to think about?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the world of business.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 leaders of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
Nor will the Russians vote for extremists.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "What good to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen, Hesse, were so far only available for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e., individually and nominally, on request of a former victim or his entitled.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratifying this agreement by all States has been completed and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "including on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers," says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, had opposed the opening of these nomination documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
Registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subject to compulsory work and, possibly, to give them proof of their internality, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Mr. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for Anti-Semitism Research at the University of Berlin Technische.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, indicated the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave their green fire to the European Commission last April to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th EU trade partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A pact of free trade hugely between the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the ten first products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "10 billion euros of services", said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation to New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential."The EU and India are meeting Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England called Thursday to alleviate the current return of credit concerns, and announced a ten billion-pound offer at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusual offer of duration.
"To alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly firm at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over that period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its provision of reserves planned during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation at five weeks", she says in a communiqué.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that BoE puts five-week liquidity on the market in an open market operation.
These usually take place within a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on a day-to-day basis with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has been 6.6%, a higher rate since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the Bank of England's money was accompanied by an important penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, supported by the evolution of the book price compared to the euro, many preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss on Thursday the articles of the Socialist Bill on Purchasing Power, which amounted to a rejection of the text.
Included in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted by the national PS office on Tuesday, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the rental framework.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was lifted following the general discussion which resulted in exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and a few hours' opposition to Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The head of the PS MP Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
Following many rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the developer/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the Melvin Benn UK producer's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival of Chicago and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is expected to be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, director of Melvin Benn's Republic Festival, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took up the Reading Festival bar in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" to which he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"Our planes chose Philadelphia as a market and worked closely with Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We were talking with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we got stuck in politics because of the current administration, followed by Charlie Jones.
"We were able to talk with Melvin Benn and we are about to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the population of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after starting in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours take place in urban green spaces," said Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a country festival in Europe and urban America."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow us to invest in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the host capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people at Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been made to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going to the press.
"Vineland will taste rock, but music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film trays to Montreal when no other than Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the role of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the Governor?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer those they will judge best," he says.
The festival race
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote cinema here.
The Oscars race started.
It will be from all festivals in the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them, and ensuring that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is posted in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in stock exchange? Experts divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands and waiting for the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year experts are not as certain as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market generally has a positive attitude.
However, statistics-based forecasts should not be made exclusively, since given the current context, uncertainties are based on markets, at least on the short term ".
Although they are not supporters of the stock exchange in the last few weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is fed through the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternative with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the flow to quality values in both the long and short periods of time".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because we are not aware of the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of inflationary tension stimulation"
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost almost 4 per cent since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this vision so negative.
Juan Solana, Analyst of Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points through the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the celebration of the Constitution (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, Analyst of Investis Banco, assesses that we are near technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be caused according to the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While Federico Olucha of Investis Banco ensures that the increases will be due to the bank and industry.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they move on.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do so very well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the last seven years, only for two occasions in December has been a month's kiss.
The genuine year-end rally took place in 2003, during which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the growth of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for now Ibex has increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and whether it succeeds on its end-of-year rally.
The Banque Populaire will open 200 offices from Monday to Saturday 12 noon
The People's Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the People Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20:30, and to open on Saturday from 10:00 to 20:30.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not this initiative that coincides with trade schedules.
This is precisely what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers that travel in these areas to make their purchases in the SMEs and the street trades chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but a renewal of existing ones.
To this end, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
Banking Manager Ángel Rivera ensures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but hiring staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience was positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets to be chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the Mundocredit brand, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the model of BBVA, where several of its agencies have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We do not want to compete with our customers ', Rivero notes.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with outside staff to the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock exchange value of his rival Antena 3
We made it.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a Telecinco's CEO, yesterday expressed his satisfaction at the close of the stock market, when he found that the chain he directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect of his joy was tarnished: 'what hurts me, it's not the fact that we're getting bigger but we're getting less down', he said.
However, he emphasized the fact that on a low market, 'we have dropped'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66% in one year.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antenna 3, who gave up 1.52% yesterday and who accumulated a 40.5% decrease since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed in the Stock Exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Five Days) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do on the same market at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of hearing '.
Telecinco announced last week that he plans to become the first television channel to surpass the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising, said.
For this data to be actual, the television channel should record an increase of 3.6% for the current fiscal year in its billing for advertising compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, the net billing of antenna 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while the net revenues of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution of Telecinco in the Stock Exchange is the important payout he has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those we have already given titles with 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is currently giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profits estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and 2009 to 7%.
This is due to the decrease in expected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast of earnings from Antenne 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

IberSecurities recommends purchasing both values based mainly on its significant dividend profitability and long-term sustainable potential.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the organization's activity to ensure that markets operate effectively.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, implies the modernisation of financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation among the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial consultation services for both special social reasons and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI), which merge value companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it increases the number of operations systems on financial instruments so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment service companies to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management, and requires them to keep a record of all operations they perform, to facilitate control by the NCMV.
By passing through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, including one showing that the debt held will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has demonstrated itself with what happened with the debt of high-risk American mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the management's transposition to legally define the functions that graduates in the Economy may have 30 years after, in 1977, it was approved, the royal decree which demarcates the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of an enterprise, which will not require the authorization of the NCMV and will be able to provide its services for product marketing and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an assessment of price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14th.
"IPC will continue on relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the increase of the CPI in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes stated in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential on monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less of a surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of the Economy regarding the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock deposits have dropped to more than 50% up to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit with the Bank of England.
At that time, he had a few record deposits of over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that had gradually fallen in two and a half months because of his clients' mistrust and despite the guarantee of 100% of that money that the Government had offered and that he would continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the British banks' incomes that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain the remaining 18 billion pounds until reaching the target of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson magnat group, known for its advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock has appointed this week the offer of Virgin's association, to which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from the bank route.
The Mayor of Totana was arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (Popular Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council's secretaries and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the mine of May last Juan Morales, current right-wing deputy, and until then municipal councillor of the mayorate, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the 'minor' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Board of Urbanism and the possibility of further arrests within the next few hours is not deferred.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Channel to the MP's lawyer from the People's Party, Juan Morales was arrested by leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession concerning the plot.
Moreover, according to the sources of the investigation, the subject matter of the investigation is the alleged incumbency of Morales' commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Tolede and to preside over the Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the leader of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Tolede for the next general election and to be President of Congress in case Socialists win the general election.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference following the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside over Congress if socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who released on 15 November his decision not to take part in the next general elections and give up his political career in order to focus on the fight against climate change within the academic framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political front since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, even though citizens already know who will be the Economic Vice-President if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and to make it "more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he was praised for his current president, Manuel Marín and "we know how to do" and did not want to do as if he already occupied his position to avoid falling, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider as "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subjected to relentless persecution, both the skeptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a movement leader who is president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach forces him to explain why his Government's action or inaction has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leading European Union in the non-implementation of Kyoto protocols.
Who are responsible for non-implementation, in which sectors it has occurred, and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what citizens' habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced on us to do, what economic consequences this will cause.
That is to say, who will sacrifice himself and pay to save the planet.
But there was and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, actual measures, are unpopular.
Costy, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Until the one hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so dangerous in Zapatero that he hurriedly denied it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have an impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for the electoral campaigns that he does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, beautifies meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party which does not claim that we move in bicycles or refresh ourselves with the fan.
The Mayor and Chief of Local Police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a suspicious hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where at the moment many officials met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal management company of the Soil Industrial and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but they are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Court of First Instance of Totana instructs.
The first six detainees were now brought to justice.
According to sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is covered by the investigation.
In addition, the former woman, the owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancee of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A. were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Immonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine pots would have been realized.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcie, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
As a result, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the region, which could have played the middle role.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana that have been re-qualified and its project would involve double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with the promotion of real estate; Conycase, which manages the parking lot of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the comment of yesterday published in Finland's most important newspaper (some leading PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course called for public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written on the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools."

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be a crime punishable by a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. The theft in a store for up to EUR 1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than the one imposed for the download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and pay it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than the one imposed for the download (a section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the traffic of CDs would involve a penalty of six months to two years
(Rule 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without permission of authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on foreign research entitled 'Money produces brain activation, especially if others receive less '.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out through tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images of the Institute Life &Brain, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when both people found that they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term of office ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the chief leaders of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead -, the former general Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are on this list whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'the Carla' list (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor of Belgrade in New York who continues the criminals on the run and pressure the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance do I need?
Motor insurance, which covers the driver in the face of potential loss, implies an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be ensured or the actual use, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of insurance, which takes into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or the actual use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
For this reason, people over 25 years of age and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower rate of claims than they are careful.
Similarly, using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages when entering into an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and old driving licence.
Although the ideal to be well insured is insurance at any risk, other more economical options exist.
The most anticipated drivers can opt for insurance at any risk with freeness, so that they get coverage from insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the client pays part of the disaster.
"The part of the amount of the disaster the customer will pay will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," said Luis Noguera, the responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection to deal with damage caused to third-party customers, but for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you're a 25-year-old, try to be cautious and avoid the damage as far as possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the future insurance price.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"Bonifications and sanctions will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to increase the bonus," explains Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25 this becomes easier for drivers when entering into a contract with insurance, as the rate of claims is reduced thanks to accumulated experience.
That is why it is better to choose insurance at all risk with freeness.
"Usually young people cannot take advantage of prior experience acquired after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'novice fear' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but has no children yet, it is preferable for him to negotiate insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as people with the lowest rate of death, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance at any risk with freeness (may be EUR 300), or insurance to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured person has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed drive and they have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchises," Justice Luis Noguera said.
For pensioners, insurance at all risk with free will is preferable (in the amount of EUR 150), or extended third party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that most suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth finals
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow are measured next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scottishs to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a null match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, receives Benfica who has four points, does not pass to him.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC has to fight the semi-finals of the World Club Cup in Japan on 13 of this month in search of a place for the 16th December final.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the null game at the Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would be first and ensuring a better crossing in the eighth finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be sufficient to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not only be able to computer on this because with nine points the game returns to Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope of ranking for the eighth finals for the second time at the Champions League, after having been beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the (1-0) extensions.
Pending the victory of the 'rosoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case Celtic would lose, to rank for the eighth finals to be able to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the band broke up in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting was "bright".
About 20,000 people ran out of tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the story of the group that got angry in the late 1990s is told.
The meeting and the World Tour coincides with the launch of a new album that resumes its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and ' Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls were on stage showing the bracelets offered by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice', part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," said Chisholm about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate it a lot."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special flight from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters were waiting for them.
They count to her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will show in California, USA, San José(December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be exhibited in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine makes the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, thereby increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are driven by pipelines, and each pipeline is carefully monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, a dispute between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurred after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian-owned gas monopoly company, tried to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase its prices in Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts stated that this would involve, for Ukraine, a 40% increase in the cost of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," announced Ukrainian Minister of the Economy, Anatoly Kinkh at Reuters News Agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies for Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, resulting in a rise in prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of the supplies of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
Consequently, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations from the former Soviet union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the controls to be carried out on its outside community employees to check if they have previous penalties, the oversight committee said.
The Secretary General's warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
In addition, Mr. Black expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health did not have any specific data on the number of overseas people he employed.
His report also highlighted other decisive controls, which were properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The reviewer-general carried out checks on non-Community personnel following the attack at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, a doctor of Iraqi origin serving the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after darkening with his jeep, in the gates of the main terminal.
He was a member of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October, as they were suspected of being involved in various attempts to blow up cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on offshore staff, to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Discovery to carry out previous criminal controls, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Reviewer General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Previous Criminal Control, thus enabling employers to undertake controls over different countries.
"Although we have found out that some information about staff has been well verified, this is not done at all."
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health performs most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it is "very unlikely" that pre-employment controls can identify employees who may commit future terrorist acts.
He stated that "the report suggests that pre-employment controls currently carried out, work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities stated that 1161 people from overseas were employed, consisting of most doctors and nurses.
But the reviewer-general stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems relating to the identification of staff members with indeterminate contracts, which may or may not be chosen, to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that current procedures for health control in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment controls for staff outside the ocean of the health service.
Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was enthusiastic about doing this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish Government associated with health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, which would be valid for all employees, including out-of-shore persons.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio pic on Joy Division's last singer, Ian Curts, has increased five awards, including the best film, to the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also attributed to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was engaged in Curtis' role in this film whose director is Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Mrs. Judi Dench was appointed the best actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandale"
Daniel Craig, star Bond won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be under international reflectors.
Prices were distributed during the ceremony at the London's Round house.
Control relates the rise to Curtis' success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, when he was 23 years old.
The black and white film whose music band was produced by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order was shot with a budget of barely 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, better known for his iconic coverage of the album Joshua Tree of U2, won two awards, the first as best stager and the second as best beginner.
The Rock has also been rewarded with the award of the Best Documentary awarded to Julien Temple's film on the singer of Clash, Joe Strummer.
The award of the best actor was awarded to Viggo Mortensen for his interpretation of the driver of a Russian mafia boss, in the thriller based in Londres by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, renowned for his coriander character interpretations, won the Richard Harris Award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The fifty-year-old director, who has filmed such films as Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the suite of Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award in honour of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admiring this great actor today, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of stage artists, actors and festival organizers.
Among the fans and bosses of Bifa are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia Block 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells that had an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on the clergy and the armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smugglers' cells.
Al Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the Allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
An eight militant cell led by a foreign resident was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper cites a statement by the Minister of the Interior, stated that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning against the eight-missile band in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appeared to have conspired on the murder of ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The government asked the clergy to do more against the Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Allied Muslim Shiite Government in the United States, considered to be heretic according to the hard line of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergy have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
Activists, encouraged by appeals against the pro-West Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces during the last five... months," said the Minister of Interior's voice on state television.
Among prisoners, 16 members of the Medina are organized into a "media cell" to promote "Takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostolate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 were accused of subsidizing militants.
Venus' climate could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists yesterday stated that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European vessel in orbit showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and might even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation linked to a slower rotation led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt the lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency probe, which studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
The Professor of Physics at Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand why Venus' climate is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are almost similar.
"Our new data enables us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, even with a living area."
Uranium enriched by the police.
A kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons were arrested and that the equipment is currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Again open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to being a candidate for the presidency to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican candidates for the presidency have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their issues submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as was the result of another debate on You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position in relation to global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have reflected a great deal about the conditions of the Republican party, a candidate for the next elections.
We don't know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show the candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest addressing a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they would hear fun things: The government raised approval increases when candidates were expressing themselves roughly.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is in the lead of the important anticipated elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his New York Mayor's term.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of using illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked whether they would be prepared to promote an "amnesia" (offering the clandestine a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this issue.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but they both remain in the race, it may be because they started to fight immigration before and incitingly than the others.
In general, candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, combined with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears toward the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other issues have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water into the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not about believing in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - in position in Iowa at a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - to declare that the death penalty is painful as much as necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to appear at the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's ascent in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious researches of subsidies carried out by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during the Wednesday debate.
These two are emerging from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two protected parties fail to agree to decide who is the best known and most traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party in good time and convincingly through a successful message on American greatness thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to shade; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
In view of the trend in British scandals, this is not particularly juridical.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra marital finger.
But here's a revelation that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have passed well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister walked backwards in his election project, insulting the British intelligence by saying that the opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrible Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's repurchase, a bank in difficulty aboard the crack, has demonstrated a failure of directives and poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for the change of the tax code led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protestant against reductions in military spending: they proclaimed that being a defence minister is for them, a part-time job.
Currently, the suspicion of wild donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of the Workers (and his former chief of vigilance) made them have had to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is boundly heading toward the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but generally leave their doubts on the side when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the ministers' offices are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was a British treasurer.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's woes, such as the long investigation of the party's funds "money counting for members of the House of Lords," voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic that she looks like it.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as members of the Tories party make him believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or fraud.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to realize Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies of ever time, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular character, who compared his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the major subsidisers of politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, not knowing that this was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the responsible for the collection of grants that had talked about questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown has not been involved: Nothing suggests that he has been aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, a committee of inquiry on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it's up to the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent public life standards committee, without a leader for six months, and preparing for a good reform on the financial aspects of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead him to renounce his particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such Mr. Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Card crumbs.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see seams drawn, circle around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the US credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in rates of costs and insolvency, which measures the non-recoverable balance sheet shares or are more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that he took $1.4 billion in his credit to the consumer, partly due to the weakness of card carriers.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly due to technical factors.
A change of laws in 2005 in the United States on personal banking resulted in an abrupt fall in bank archives, which in turn caused heavy credit card losses; the number of archives (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly amount of debt that consumers have to settle.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is fairly strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the 2007 emission volume would be 25% higher than last year.
Direct links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species than to the value of heritage, and therefore the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, debt by credit card would become a priority to repair the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of action.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans," said Gary Perlin, Capital One Director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of a significant decline.
If the lower prices of real estate and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Take good care of the dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to demonstrate their roles in relation to fraud committed by the former financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of the seven alleged collusive fraud charges in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are due to appear in the courthouse in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation which was launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the debacle of Enron.
The charges against the bankers, known as the "three of Natwest" claimed to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the stage manager of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to call banking procedures.
By the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the subsidiary bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But really these $20 million went to the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracys in the Enron debauchery.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endured six-year imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1 million security each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, in banking in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide his billion debt or even propose his bid speculations as profitable.
The collapse has caused thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion loss in market value and more than $2 billion loss in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling has been sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were futile because of her death from a heart attack last year.
Not in, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats since it is more of a family use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday, at the Millionaires' Salon, an orgy of inciting consumption, for four days, which stands in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new Russians for their various products, ranging from docking yachts to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looked at a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
"it's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, such Dallas"
"We had the same experience in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar of Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University."
Such were the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, and the Russians emerged as the world's largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a luxury industry conference allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires, which are globally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the economic and financial research centre.
(World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, which is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She attended the trade fair for the first time with the Russian distributor, The Bijoutier Groupe de Soho.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the living room, Sunday night, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 claim to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who grabbed her high-cut dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems primarily aimed at the new wealthy, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to tail in the plugs to come up to a huge warehouse where they are exposed to Cadillac Escalades, platinium canines, Mövenpick ice-creams, personalized billiards tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund wig bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, proudly seated at the Royal factory stand for the manufacture of Dutch Delf porcelain, in front of a wall painting by Raimbrant on blue tiles, hand made.
"It is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers here stated that Russians with old capitals (10 to 15 years of age are too much in line with Russian standards) have already passed from brilliant logos to a kind of limited-editing brand that could not be sold in the salon.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires or tourists, hang out every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he had sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and inlaid cotton of gold.
On the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with last cry alarm systems, also declared that he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday after noon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customises luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a drawing car for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals to look like a wheelchair.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of brass leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in the prices of the real estate here.
"if you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be millionaire, at least on paper, if it's not in this case," he said.
"there are more than you could think of"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has erected four stands representing British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers stopped to launch masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or implicate a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire," said Mr.Karyev.
Unapproved surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window bay of the Just a little Healththier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrives.
And then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon, that the police have not yet identified, resident on 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they are confident, the results of the toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take time, but which should allow to solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Melle Arroyo was the assistant to the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything she could to protect me"
McCarthy said that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, leaving two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, speaking from the Union County Public Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo died of unauthorized surgery.
"It is an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities indicated that they had arrived at her about 3 p.m.
and found Melle watering on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh could not confirm whether Melle Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical firm.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Miss Castro where a fanned rosemary lies in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian was flying back.
A blue cane called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two bicycles all ground attached to the sides.
McCarthy stated that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him navigate into the new city and abandon his framed political culture.
"it said "you have to pay attention to this," he said.
"she was there when I came, and again when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates of the global stock exchange.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the credit conditions, subsequently reducing the interest rates promoted by the reassuring statements of the Vice President of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after Donald Kohn, number 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partially "inverted some improvements in the operation of the market in late September and October.
If this turbulence were to persist, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the US markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news about the American economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil has been exacerbated following the statement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, i.e., 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losers of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in Londres where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55% to 13,289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2, adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the re-appearance of credit difficulties in markets has been highlighted as a result of the strong demand for a monthly auction of tri-funds from the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Presses on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject additional funds into London financial markets that cause credit tensions have caused the rates of "Libor" monthly loans to the British banks, which have caused their highest growth since September last year, to 6.59% following a sharp rise since November 12.
England faces a call for judgment against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be drummer #6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectioners who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, Chief Coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because Hugh Morris' office, the President General of England, begins to complete the application forms to become a national selectioner, at least in part-time.
The one who will not win the N°6 will be bad, but life is often unfair and sport is also bad.
It is never easy to eliminate what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than due to lack of ability.
There is not only in the cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubeby"; both new executives who have obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room only for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricket unless at least one chance is given?
Figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricket one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to earn a seat.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have already lived their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's gonna play at Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could annihilate or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful rounds, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricket of the Test, and that despite the fact that his double cent against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, its brilliant and considerable beginning at the 88-year-old test in Bombay, 32-cents first class compared to six for Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and its excellent launch ranking.
But Shah made only ten laps during his two innings against the Caribbean in May during the Test in Lord, his city as a Middlesex player, and that, the immediate rejection by the pickers when Vaughan again in shape, claims his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is full of joy to live.
Nothing frightens him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently capped on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, British sponsor.
He carried only a few minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his teamman who looked at him from a distance, to ask him whether "had he seen this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, its glare allows him to do services that go to him, and that he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Can this be the true art of selection?
I would be able to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has found normal.
Some have returned to fight the militants who drove them away from home.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses of the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Dr. Sunni.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and read in newspapers what happened in Baghdad and seeing that the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to leave for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented the Iraqis from working.
His neighbours from Shia to Amariyah called him in to inform him that the militia assisted by the United States, allowed him to chase Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of an attack on the grenade after he encouraged citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me to put in place an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm going home today," said Sabah Alu Obedi, 62 years old.
Many say they have been attracted by the increasing calm of the capital since the American troops arrived, and in view of the continuing formation of well-armed "groups of citizens" and working with American military to defend their neighbourhood.
But others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline in the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three children, expressed the suspicion expressed by everyone about the visas for exiles that Nuri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country because of the death squadrons.
"We didn't have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to stop giving Iraqi visas to force them to return to Iraq," said retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be explained in part by the fact that Sunnis have been driven from Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that sudden flows of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated State conducts vocational training, and shines even through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-determination, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Sarre, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies by a double or even triple degree.
This shows the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the country's children to higher schools in numbers above the average - many of them without a degree from the Gymnasium.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five students get their degree at a vocational school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of graduates in engineering has fallen by one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education has forced schools above a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of daycare is free of law - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparison studies can show whether the performance of students improves in a sustainable manner.
In the 2003 PISA studies, the proportion of students at risk was reduced by 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Sarre has not improved as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are getting better.
And despite the measles, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - we could otherwise gain points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high school - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez fixes the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon tic-tac other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will make the half-hour timer rise in the South American country.
Chavez is now a cartoon in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, as a result of a new law, the watches will be fixed at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed the separation of time zones on the world in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a result of a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained President of Colombia, he would not have relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw in Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "brained the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Chávez Sunday.
In Spain too Chávez is in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ring is furious in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (why don't you mind) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the Internet.
It was delivered by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the latest Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant appeals of left-wing populists and who told him to shut up.
Germany was threatened by a drop in wages in 2007.
Despite the strong conjuncture, according to one forecast, a true lower wage value threatens German employees this year.
Experts cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault is the low wage development, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economy and Research on Environment, in the journal "Bild".
New charges could also be made in terms of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected fall in unemployment insurance by 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the words of the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion in food and hydrocarbon prices has increased the inflation rate at its highest level for 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 percent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere of life, Venus is more like Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbines at poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightnings on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" probe has now proved it - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus explode at a height of about 56 kilometres of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprine, the lightnings would have revealed life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If life had been there, it must have been at a very old date in history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be few living things on Venus' surface today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the infernal twin of the Earth, but she remains a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which resembles so much the massive and dimensional Earth, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venezuelan research, since no more probes were on the way to exploring this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only highlight Venus' singularity within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than supposed at first glance.
Thus researchers found, in addition to the wind turbines already known at the north pole, a cloud peat at the south pole, which turns even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Institute of Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet qualified as a star in the evening or in the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: one Venetian day lasts 243 earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not recall much the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have formed under similar conditions.
Of the two, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has been fixed on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes the largest part of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for the end of the party's quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellerie.
In an indirect way, he criticized the SPD because of the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and I am summarising the great coalition to close the quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for the differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the criticisms that it would organise a new China policy.
The German chancellor did not take her distance with the traditional policy of one China.
"China also knows," Köhler said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his discontent about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the CDU's "foreign policy" in the field of foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese government not only commissioned German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to Spiegel's information, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of foreign ministers in both countries.
The head of the Chinese government Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the Dalai Lama reception was a mistake.
China refuses European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots such as those in France.
Street fights with police, fires, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not explode in the streets by violence, the German Minister of Interior demanded.
Burning barricades, breakers who shoot the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fear similar developments in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive does not form a part of us, and that it breaks down in violence.
We need to take this seriously," he said to the "Neue Presse" that appeared in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated States and municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"This has already shown its first success from summits to conferences on Islam."
But it would be too early for an end of warning.
Schäuble notes at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had been engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
Also in Toulouse, public cars and buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government, that is what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, required.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need for action.
Kolat emphasizes that youth under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
Above all, more places should be provided for training.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish communities added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat pleaded: "But we must still be careful."
Youth should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter overflew the area with headlamps.
The authorities in office reported three arrests, as well as a few burned cars and trash.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has ensured calmness.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured during riots at Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles overwhelmed Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor's utopia scene shows that the coalition ended with the background - and there's nothing to expect from her.
In which country does this chancellor live justly?
After his disappointing intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics has been pushed away by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it visible to all how accurate this reproach was.
There was no real interest or feeling for the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: an overwhelming politician, who has fled into foreign politics and who even lives there in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of itself - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now it cramps with formulas all made, that growth would affect people.
By this she destroys her image of pragmatist, who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases left for this.
In this regard, the number of times it lapses when it comes to family allowance is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starters to pronounce a half-specific sentence.
She was lying in unknown terrain from the moment it became concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, both Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard offensive battle - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refugee for the clandestine," criticises Mitt Romney for his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one against his side with heavy reproach: "I would say that his own house was a house for illegals" said Giuliani and complained to the former governor of Massachusetts for using undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are going up to the attack: since the Republican base has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use discussions on CNN first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain launches his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to demand immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also makes the lesson forcefully by Vietnam veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called Waterboarding, a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go from time to time beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is reflected in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, applauses go down in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites appear again.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney says, "commits and presents his apologies to the base and to the television audience for having been still a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes through a flowing knot when she is asked for her opinion on literary interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time as a civilian.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the armies, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of rule by the army ends.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday he had passed on his position as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had therefore turned to international pressure, particularly that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Shortly after his investment Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayium, and thus meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with jurists of its ranks, had rejected all appeals last week against the controversial re-election of the chief of state on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded on a street near the border of Afghanistan.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
The German supergroups of the 1970s rejoice: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return they appeared records of their great success "Live 1974".
By this time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and first his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, throne in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left of Michael Rother, 57-year-old and with a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius is curved on his console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is added inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen too much themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group is playing again has assured some of Krautrock's amateurs.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys show that, of course, the name is reasoning in the collective memory of pop, but in no case so long as this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the 1970s?
Especially since the so-called "Krautrock" has been more and more pleasant in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded in 2003 the Echo award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, we saw in the room the German pop faces interrogators.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period the impact power felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly set up in Kraftwerk and had finally made himself a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
About 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in a former Weser farm, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Komune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So said there was in the trash a fan of the corral Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many retain Harmony far from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as music sounded, the group suffered material poverty.
The harvest of the dead wood did not serve itself in search of itself.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as well as someone believes to remember.
Rother made him wish at that time to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and made his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (burning hearts).
Cluster relives in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the live album from Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Snow! had already been buried on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the World Culture House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence is set in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Projections of other black and white pictures of bazaar cable tools are used to form the legend.
Before, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by glued microphones to the organ and the battery, to shoot the instruments of the unheard sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built itself.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
The three in large technical fixtures.
At this very moment the choral of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He's never been rocky.
The roots were less searched in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the leak of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who screams "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia is no longer angry now.
But what goes most of its kind will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
It can hit someone's nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Matriterial Peace", two films again address the Balkan War.
But both don't convince.
Either projects rely too much on action and on foolish shooting exchanges or, on the contrary, they are too teary.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: of course war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkans mountains, but it is right there, in the most dismal back country of the war in Bosnia, that actor Richard Gere was then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many nice and rifle roles in films with feelings for women and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism have delighted him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why today's films must be as long and confusing as collective locomotive drivers' conventions?)
He presents a magnificent representation full of eyelashes: at the bottom, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not as benevolent: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, has kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this effort, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Matriterial Peace", which also emerges this week, the endless suite of missed films on the Balkan War.
From "Matriterial Peace" we can quickly make the trial: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar francs, in which one of them falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not presented as the only causes of all the evils, this film as flat as a television film is lost too quickly in action and the exchange of foolish shots.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there has never been a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track the high war criminal "the fox", may have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard and Richard Shepard) at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it was presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must assign him more a romantic adventure with a Bosnian who was killed afterwards.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, within the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages to ensure that NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have not succeeded in five years: trap the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague should be brought before the Court of Crime against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at liberty, and he suspects the Americans and French (where they must exceptionally agree) not to drive the hunt in a rather intensive way because of secret political agreements.
But good intentions and evil are so similar this time that a famous poem from Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "Compatible, I see the veins of the swollen front, clearly: how tired it is to be wicked."
The films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumbling heads, but they imply how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the type of films on the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this paper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
We can add that there have never been any good films on South Africa.
What happens every time: when a star drags on a crisis home or on a field of mines, he then leaves something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grezen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All these conflicts may still be too close over time.
In any case, decades have passed before Hollywood could make a good film on the Holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films still need to mature - those who today are typical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been celebrated unanimously at their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know today also too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatombe comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this delighted the screenwriters with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" have in fact become as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how far the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you should have the sarcastic artistic look and distance from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because some things never change."
"The great cities will always be horrendously dangerous, the men will always be killed in a horrifying way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust picks up the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics met with critical virulents in politics and economy.
Many want to keep fighting for the games on the waterfront.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
The principal director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political and sports momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find it a new longer-term starting point, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday at his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to apply to the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports" Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, about Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time frame that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, says Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A abandonment of the candidacy would be further in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the German Federation's plenary meeting of higher schools in sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg for the 2015 University as being "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of higher schools in sport had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD fraction accused the Senate of not using this valuable time in the construction of homes in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grassbrook has been denied by the Senate for years because it has played the Olympiads card and has excluded the construction of homes," said delegates of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Small Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiads and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "Event Factor".
The candidacy for the Summer Olympics in 2012 would have raised a great deal of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg had, however, broken up against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' boxes.
He who connects Sweden's concepts and wooden caisse, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or what if?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the eighty-ten Brillo-Boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museum of Stockholm today results in a disappointing result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former director of the Pontus Hulten museum gave in 1995 to the Moderna Museum, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international market of art.
The ancient history is closed, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorical productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powder soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - of hundreds of boxes made of cardboard: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather of models, of exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered law into the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the term "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached auction sales of more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum wrongly claimed that about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would have subsequently yielded him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén caisses were produced only in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the curator-in-chief of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other private Swedish collections, among which two were made at Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and engraved, then applied with a paint brush with white oil.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the painting has been applied directly without background on laminated panels, using a paint roll - moreover, it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic painting.
"These caisses have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brilliant Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come another decision, the Moderna Museum will classify the six caisses in its collection as copies/exposure material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "trouble accusations" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap crates.
But since we've had an inexorable silence there.
The rebel soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandoned the same ones who had retreated to a hotel in Manila and had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to power had recently taken assault on the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday due to an attempt to putsch missed in 2003 - including Trillanes.

They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal forces in power closed the area around the hotel respectable.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemns the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had command before the Scouts Ranger elite unit, said that other units of the army soon wanted to join the march.
The criticisms of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded by corruption complaints for months.
The Finance District of Manila has already been the theatre of the attempted mutiny of approximately 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts at puttingsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
