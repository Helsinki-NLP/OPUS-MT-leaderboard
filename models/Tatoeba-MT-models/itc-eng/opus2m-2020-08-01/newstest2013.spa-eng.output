A Republican Strategy to Obstacle Obama’s Reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth and states that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what is happening in Canada, the US is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of the American governments enacted new laws, starting in 2009, which made the process of registration or voting difficult.
This phenomenon has spread following the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 which restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, those laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the polling and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit a photographed identity document.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana law.
The Republican authorities therefore hurriedly extended this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photographed identity document.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photographed identity document issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But often obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
In this way, new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photographed identity document.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who vote most for democratic candidates cannot use the photographed identity document issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote on Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of three Spanish voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported certain laws in 2011 that abolished the registration of voters on the same day of the polling in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the general elections of 2004, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters dropping in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states favoring the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the voters in the state.
In the case of Hispanics it was exactly the same.
These represent only 11 per cent of the electors, equivalent to 24 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, white people, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Prosecutor's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, it was possible to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photographed identity document.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, since it is clear that they intend to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that have adopted those laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to affirm with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system scale will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this respect, measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Do you test or not do it?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant of themselves, doubt whether or not detection tests should be done.
Do you take the test or not?
We asked for advice from two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, a large number of infections among sample groups were detected, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain mortality difference between the patients who had been detected and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up to 12 years of age, also demonstrated that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are painless.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his or her cancer. He or she should be given all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not attack life in the long term, in which case one should opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since such cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their life.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer you treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be done.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing illness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, healthy habits of life remain the best way to reduce the risk of suffering the disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Society against Cancer.
On the other hand, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It seriously damages people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
One hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
The Weight
Fat and obesity also favor the occurrence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
The power supply
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering from colorectal cancer.
Charcutery products should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat for your smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to CSC, vitamin E studies are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another one what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined either.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about the concerns and family background of each one with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still lacking to be completely safe.
However, we assume that this is Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem few.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that norm and don't try too much, because it will end up harming itself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the principle of Pauli exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" which largely consists of some of its characteristics.
Physicians classify particles in two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called farms, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand there are the bonnies, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which is indeed extraordinary, the boisterous are divided into two groups: the months, of which we will not speak here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These boins, you might stress here, they're not the exotic bugs that we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as an "messeur" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave is born (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the boons "force carriers".
More stable field
It happens the same with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is about another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were an iced pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
That is why a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN (the great Hadron collisionr is a 27 km circle ring!) is needed to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do so, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself stuck at the door of a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do so have a mass, while the rest (like photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what "can they bring" all these investigations?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to examine the differences between observations and predictions of MS.
For their part, many earnestly want to be found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that taps certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of such investigations on our day-to-day lives is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong in saying that you will have none.
To see: in the early 1960 ’ s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would provoke.
They were watching scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was considered rather a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light catcher in 1969 during his optical research.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this catcher now serves as an "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which was worth the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die.
In its Dying Commission in Dignity, Quebec had recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a bill is prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
The Duty has tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year breath.
"They had given me five years of life, but I've been like seven," he relates, made a pass, lying in his bed in the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused you damage: a huge weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on your own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, even smile, talk to strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for me to heal diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man stands up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he observes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made her children discover.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I no longer have any more desires in this life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, one last visit of your son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and help with food.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctorates of the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When dying you are offered mouthwashs with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, your son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the centre Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being equal.
Along with a 94-year-old man who savors his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows while everyone drinks his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age with cancer," said Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care problem
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care centre.
And several agencies, such as Victor-Gadbois and Grand Montréal's home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative deficiency in Quebec's health care that makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the eminence of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to demonstrate his opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," she says, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in emergencies suffering great pain without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get the right care."
And at the same time, many oncologists are obsessed with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s survival hopes were already low when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that she wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she said.
"But she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of the sick who ask to die thank their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in terms of pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the disease will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want relief."
The implementation of this report has been possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from Canada's health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fund raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia count, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", which is part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
A "industry" that went too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It turns out curious how the system sprays once we've hunted the big media," ironic Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the escalation of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation of the misappropriations related to road contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal Prime Minister of that time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts", containing some of its instincts to remain with a proportional portion.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, while hoping to be able to "show the stratagems that exist behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies to its team of government interveners, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of the "Marteau Squad", which, since 2009, have made Montreal's "scarlet cartel" moderate to inflate contracts.
Over the past few weeks, the unit has registered in series allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of an outlying city.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
Repeated bribes are suspected in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Acurso and Lino Zambic, have been formally accused.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambim distributed money to right and left over the years 2000, with more than $88,000 (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for former Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, explained this perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and company bribes from the construction sector for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he had inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30 and 40 per cent in respect of false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his chests with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early in November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected Montreal policies to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to promoters in full estate boom.
70% of electoral campaign money was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she ensures that she pulls "from a thread to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish the culprits."
And he adds that the process is "sick, but positive."
We are cleaning up the wounds but it would require a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert so that questionable practices do not repeat.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of the '"elected politicians in the wake of the stratagem".
Estimate by 70% of the share of dirty money that was destined for funding electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironizes: "I have been told that this is just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to it, "while electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It advocates a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "we cannot fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story violates the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look into the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would I explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
Day after day next to him.
Technical staff have also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not warm.
From my beginnings in the pre-formation center of INF Clairefontaine to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always moved forward in a busy way.
It's going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Anncelotti.
The recruits of this summer are used to fighting very high-level parties.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti has given me a lot about my position.
It is supported by attachments like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in League 1 and it is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He's been working with big players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has removed our position as leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our greatest goals is the Champions League: we have ranked for the eighth finals in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
Let's try to get as far away as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first of our leagues in front of the Port so we can get the eighth round of finals.
Can the PSG become a great short-term European club?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the GSP is being given to its means of implementing this project.
Don't win the drink on League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we're going to invest all our efforts to take that title of champions.
Last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we were faced with the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it'll be good.
Even if large teams like Marseilles, Lyons and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have weapons to carry.
Do you think the media are waiting for more than the PSG?
It is normal for them to wait a lot for us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still find things to reproach us is a little frustrating.
We wonder what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, which, after two seasons, has not managed to qualify for eighths of the final, and they have also invested so much!
In view of the inverted amounts, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be to neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "impelled" by this new PSG.
That proves that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
We better say we have a "Zlatadendependance."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he sets a lot of goals.
He's come to prove he's the star of League 1.
And he's shown on every team he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect man and player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us to make progress.
How did you cope with Eurocopa 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating gambling time.
I saw things over there and I got reinforced.
Today I manage to play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine and that is why we have exemplary behavior today.
What do you see from Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the "bleus"?
It's getting results.
They are well located in the Global Classification Group.
The picker is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to sit the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game throughout my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
This is contrary to current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a convertible virtual currency to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol to the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to.
Some 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as form of payment.
The quote of bitcoin, after reaching the top of $30 (€23) in June 2011, dropped to $25 five months later, before returning to round the ten dollars today (the quotations are recorded on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credit", used to advance in a video game and which can be won by playing or can be purchased (and even occasionally swapping).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositors of accounting books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins changes consist of the public accounts book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers and the winner, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file-cutting, i.e. transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take the new transaction" and add a number before "trace" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the set chain of the other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would want to pay twice with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to 100 million, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network already has its heights.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The fault used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November the "giant rivets" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been changed," rejoiced Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a teaching book on that currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or to a non-contact mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to launch in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", Pierre Noizat says, which ensures that thousands of users are present.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to impose, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if this currency is successful.
We've left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished mainly the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered to be terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they join the Jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbek or Tajik causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which was observed from the top of the hills planted by almonds thanks to the French credits, was made in order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was wrapped in fire and blood because of the fights between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the darkness of their peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old people, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, using government land to sell them as solars for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and children.
Those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to be given work.
All, including armed opposition, are greedy of mobile phones. TV and their Turkish brochures that present a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstitution of the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the position of the prime minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no packaging has been fixed or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to take over them.
No energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, no mining exploitation.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak's copper mines, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig out the vast Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country largely dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "get the hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, which are eager to obtain local labour, have been able to help contain insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, solar protection and increase of crop areas.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in those valleys often located over 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
For them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civil aid, well controlled and to reach them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives it full powers, he decided to play the whole thing for the whole.
He caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And for almost two years, Egypt has used a provisional text, several times changed, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delusion" and continues "treasoning his word" and "strengthening the right".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a step towards bringing an end to the institutional and political crisis and accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organized within the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to give up their draft to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview to the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or vote on my text or keep the powers full", powers that are supposed to end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its great majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not enforce their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did likewise.
In order to achieve the quorum needed, 11 persons, substitute members were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As was expected, the voting articles were unanimously.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, for the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which is the subject of all the views, remains at last identical to the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the norms", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals are hypocritical and consider it to be nothing more than an advertising artimagin.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is made through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who must confirm their conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are further increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be quite less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked in that text are not ulemians but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Bluuet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, for the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might be raised in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to decide above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms concerning the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will claim that there are few compared to those during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
As the military wishes, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Civil prosecutions in military courts will also not be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
These also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they consider to be libertizive.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to go out last night on television, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State manifested themselves on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the world's obligation and a sea of salmon
The promised Earth combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pillar" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the nets filled.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers travel here on the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "See Pain").
It begins in the fortress of Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial took place, and continues along the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Unction and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Obbligation of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As tradition is, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will then become reality.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what was left of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are found in mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by their own means, only those who dedicate themselves to climbing.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
Until there, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On one trip you won't be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israel Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Manuscripts or Qumran Rolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In its exhibition of paintings there are canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha Bathroom, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
The entrance is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they ring the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they are bathed even in the winter months, as the temperature of the water does not lower than 21 degrees and the air is warmed up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that can easily hold up to those who can’t swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salt water, salmur and curative bars and to fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to order their broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
It retains the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it was the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he took a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "mix" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30 per cent of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed to shekels (currently 1-3,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the High City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling in any kind of public transport costs 6 sheqels and for this price you can travel doing transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, on Saturdays the Sabbath is celebrated.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of beef and lamb-based dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, falafel, which are balls of soft garbanzo, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no street dogs.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that "walk to their liking" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the cars parked.
The rodents love the crowded places and do not reject the golosins.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bicycle will take you for 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to visit the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount exceeding 51 per cent at the same rate in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
As MEPs and human rights defenders discuss the implications of the law on compulsory examination, there have already appeared in the country of fearers trading with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
Since 1 December a law enters into force, according to which each labour immigrant must carry out an examination to verify his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be made mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be sufficient to give up the examination of the language, but also the examination of Russian history and the basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are excluded.
The persons who obtained their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will be sponsored by the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of the Friendship of Peoples, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be tested in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centres are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the State Duma Members and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this really bring?
What changes will the mandatory knowledge of the language, for both Russians and immigrants themselves, bring?
First, representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labour immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before its departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
The problems are experienced by immigrants without profession, education, who do not know the language or have medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "paid voyage" on a creepy and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise them something, but upon arrival they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," confirmed the head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be mad, boss!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they want to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don't even have anything to feed their children, because they don't talk about clothes anymore, wear them and buy them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as language law is concerned, rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbid the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not that easy.
The cause lies in bureaucratic obstacles and language difficulties in itself.
Moreover, legalization costs money: twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and by only one thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"They ask us one hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," the journalists told the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Come on, don't be lazy, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was revealed that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed on standard colour printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand roubles.
This is twice and a half more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, converge government officials and rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not have successfully passed the examination the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with recorded weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to implement the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of civil-use weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Shooting shots during wedding celebrations where fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow's lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which To cherish seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining arms licenses from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
In the network an open letter has appeared, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "unreasonable rigurosity" be discontinued.
The percentage of vandalism with the use of recorded weapons is minimal, commented at the service of BBC news from Russia, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lénikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of firearms in internal organs were committed during the six months of 2012, compared with a total of 1168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civil-use arms sector will not be a disadvantage for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, you can find any weapon at low prices in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the Upper Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts requests for weapons
The first one, "the covering of the army or military," that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officials and the same Caucasians," Baranets said.
The following type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here are included stolen weapons from police warehouses and stolen weapons directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are on sale from military arsenals.
There were often explosions in many military arsenals.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the lack," says an ex-Military.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
"They have now proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including that of Moscow," says the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
Many guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," the former military explains.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data of portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the weapons in the black market have arrived there "on account of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent are "illegal archaeology".
The dependent on one of the arms shops, which asked for their surname not to be mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal excavators had not been bought by anyone for a long time because they were too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some alferage, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"It carries the weapon to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," we tell
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan is to be carried out, they make test purchases to illegal arms traders," he adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed that I go to the "Begovaya" platform, where I would be a man who would take me to a "squinita" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store's dependent. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
There are vendors in the markets, but there must also be arrived, let's say "from Mr. Ivanovich, who asked him to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple steel maneuvers through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I'm not going to delay him.
Newmen are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was tested on the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when an article on this subject was available.
The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't "all."
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets' words, does not offer him cat by hare: everything there is can be tested.
I, as a potential client, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa Shop
The search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents or personal encounters.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write on the billboard "Buying a gun or a machine gun."
There users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," ask the user "Iván" (preserved spelling).
"I buy a TT. Moscow gun," he asked his question, "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handed capture of those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia
military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: the website is usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions for you to know where the weapon is hidden," says the NGO press secretary "The Right to Weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one is left without a gun and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handed capture of those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov per $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO “The right to arms”, a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
One and a half months will have to be expected.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the middle-ranking chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, representing 22,900, and the number of cases identified as theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the United States are being attacked.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has been launched in the United States at Walmart Corporation supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and to immerse itself in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the aim of the protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, the pride of bass that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by confrontations.
On that day, some Walmart corporation workers, who employs 2.2 million people in the world, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in the corporate stores, whose products are aimed at people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything, from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why many badly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and output of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because he pays little to his workers.
The latter also complain about the bad working conditions, such as the lack of mountings or hand scanners.
This "Black Friday" event participants demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage up to $12 an hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart places the salary increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will result only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters say satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
"Black Friday" was extended in its shops from 8 a.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day and during that time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their register boxes made the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview to the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they left their job "less than five" employees from Walmart and that the protest had been nothing but "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"Free Box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not precisely the great Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and so for now there is none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and don't pay for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
Nobody wins less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the exhibitors, in part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few viewed this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble upon some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live from this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal magazine forum, there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e., double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits administration from preventing this right and punishing union movement activists with rigors and layoffs.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the most important is the excessive rotation of staff.
Disagreements
Noiseful protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in half the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, particularly the member of the Jumaane Williams City Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example the mayor candidate of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast food sector so they can get fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves."
As described in the New York Times newspaper, this has been the greatest manifestation of this type in American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York worked.
It is still unclear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy"
The theme of increased reality, so popular among modern tech fans, is recently perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Early in the summer, at his annual Google conference, he demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, Microsoft was also known to have submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Cambridge Microsoft laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it became clear that for scientists of that company, glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of your research group's study?
- We are dedicated to the interaction person-computer, but we also try to widen the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with your finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is in our future?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes on 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world must be freed from computer technology to our, to our physicist, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you can't be considered a panacea, it's still pending to resolve the issue of privacy, since you don't always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of computer interaction are good, but each one in his own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project on which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, do you want to force users to adapt to what they can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good in-depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Are you missing resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on the Z axis.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and current 30 fps movements are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects man-machine interaction.
It would be very useful for my work to be an equivalent of such a device, but it would not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And you don't have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "camera", one of which is in fact the infrared transmitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analog of Kinect, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn't presented his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of enhanced reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up an intelligent phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smart phone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in which is your strength (private things you can only see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics usually point out: there is no touch answer!
Your hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- At my conferences I often say that increased reality is the seventh break in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of touch sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibleness to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays aimed at a specific point where the finger is found gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone is blowing it in the thumbs, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, which is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what it seems he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here we hide another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, cheating the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That's what makes work attractive with virtual reality for researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Custom subjective staff instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens ahead, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best there are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, to whom you can find near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are shown.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophosophosists of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of St. Petersburg in the late 1980s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city wakes up in the inhabitants of smiles and lifts all the mood.
Recently, he took into his hands an organ and became the organizer of St. Petersburg, as he has grown up to make such a difficult role, because of his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I'm dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray gives rise to aggressiveness and agitation of ungood properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my work was shown.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who took "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was over.
I went to the theater for clothes, music of all genres, but not for lyrics.
And all of this came together at your Art Clinic... it was important for me to meet at the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the Bohemia of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Van Gogh Ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Lenningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animated of many programs prior to the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Clinica del Arte.
There our employees and regular customers were there.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is uncomfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them are clearly expressed the current and the occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns."
Clowns are an atemporal category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like this is painful and terrifying.
But in the clowns everything is overcome and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothing.
Now one is followed by clothing, oriented externally, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person doesn't owe himself or give his hand, but spit it on his face.
And deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
A cultured city must have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, can commercial art be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touchy.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
People used to gather in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simplones others.
Now everyone has been divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to please everyone.
Now we have to think who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov arrive for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, it all fades away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you've achieved.
When I was young, I made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied money just to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is a concept: culture officer.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When the kings were right, everything was different, the kings may not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are now very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level who properly assess them and open up their way.
It is now flourishing the subjective personal taste.
The same Erata, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Give birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity is asked the main question: How to continue the species in conditions of infertility or on the same planet of replacement?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the chief investigator of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in Venus' orbit... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with flora.
Half a century ago experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of peppers grown in orbit did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the insect breeding in the orbit, small fruit flies, drosophiles.
In 1979 they were sent to the hatching egg space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of pregnancy.
We get as a result a normal pollutant.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chicken has to find support, it must stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they didn't find support, the chickens would turn around at random.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they were just dying.
"And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" they will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, who were sent to space already with fetuses.
At first, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be done," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been travelling in space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our bird flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says the veteran of the Vakhtang Vachnadze aerospace sector.
In June 1964, only after one year of flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told who after long flights everything worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonauts Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation of the flight.
Under null floating conditions, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates infertility.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, yet still hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its birthplace.
The small-amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside its mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for you to get used to water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if infertility is a more natural state for a newborn, it is necessary for women to gravitate, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy the abdominal muscles and pelvis are degrepitated very quickly, the capacity to expel the foetus is reduced.
Well, let's skip that, trusting in the action of labor stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth to a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear in a special suit for training, such as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we're going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will give us cause to bring to Earth a disabled person, a totally inadequate person," says the head of the bioethics committee of the Biomedical Problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships turn to a distant planet that will be home to their children born into space.
Head of NKU: The inspection of the system "švarc" has not given to the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application does not.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (NKU) says in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," he describes the current situation.
Joint controls by the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So, is it banned or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office which has an obligation to carry out such checks or require obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the control commission in the Congress of Deputies, you discussed the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement was compared in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started to perform about two years ago.
In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, this follows the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself.
We have united everything and, although control has not yet completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more stringent and more complete", however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more and more strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a common control of this kind could help to stop investing in the creation of laws, reduction and improvement of limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The savings economy means getting something appropriate at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the award limit means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paper", that those who want to look for faults in the system can do it more easily than if the limits remain as high as they are now.
You speak of our country's problems with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized otherwise?
As for the offices, such as the NKU, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a college too, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
The powers are also rather analogous to some extent, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts are even at this level, and in this respect it is slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled at the Federal Court of Auditors.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to draw up a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be accurately specified in what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of inspectors?
That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make these kind of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, it wouldn't mean any benefit to them working with our office, would it?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean to your Office? Is it in any way manifesting its impact?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post checks, there must be a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool of "non-economic risk detection", by which we have passed nearly 14,000 public tenders, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar.
Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, is an obstacle to the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "strengthened" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous regulations, the persons under control were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each non-compliance with public procurement law meant breach of budgetary discipline.
So does it make sense to tighten the law like this?
I don't think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this road leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to the fact that it is autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system banned or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the Office's performance that has an obligation to carry out such checks and require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say that we will do as if nothing.
In the law on public procurement, legislation is quite strict as to how to act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
On the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
Roads have ice plates, although most of them are transitible
In several locations of the Czech Republic, the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most of the routes are transitible, caution should be extreme in some cases.
Karlovy Vary region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitible, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature descends and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas the snow layer is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metal Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still bad due to fog, according to information from the regional road traffic control centre.
The R6 rapid road and the first-class road in the region are now unrestricted.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface can be frozen and rebaladized.
In addition, all routes of second and third category, including mountain roads, can also be transitable.
However, in some of them there are still sections with ice remnants and pine snow.
Greater attention is needed on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some East Bohemia roads there is danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have been formed on the roads, reports the Road and Highway Directorate on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the mountains roads from Krkonoše to Orlické time.
There is a pine snow layer in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, today the sky will be between clear and partially clouded, without precipitation.
Temperatures will generally range between three low zeros and one positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are transitible today in the morning, although caution must be extreme and adaptation will be necessary in time.
In the early hours of the morning there will be ice, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent decrease in temperatures, some pathways could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will meet with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what comes from the information from the Regional Road Operations Control Centre.
The D5 motorway is nearly unrestricted, although caution is recommended, especially on the way between 80 km and 131 km.
The surface of most of the first-class roads is dry and without ice.
In the area of the road of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany there may be stages with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case it is also warned of steps with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the least transit routes in the area of Šumava.
Olomouc region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will meet with partly waste snow.
After chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators removed the snow during the night; on the road in Šumper some three centimeters of snow were accumulated, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most routes are unrestricted.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, there are remnants of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with half-disposed snow towards Jeseník," confirmed today a operator from the road administration of Šumper to ČTK.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also came to Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the slopes of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the road in Olomouc the roads are unrestricted, on the road in Šternberská the drivers should drive with caution on the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
North Bohemia road operators have reported complications in different stages at first thing in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lowest areas, so the ice and snow obviously remain on the pavement. Instead, in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been recorded for the mment.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Since general roads, unfavourable conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just less than a month, the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to catch.
The Tap Tap music group rather likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-wide benefit that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar set out for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20 at 21 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, along with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the World, Cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it on beneficial concerts?
Of course it is, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The hymns will be connected simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech TV.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video clip, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial events and concerts...
We are fully committed to participating in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will be the purpose of the money collected in concerts against the end of the world?
The equipment for the educational center without barriers Study, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličk.v usedav.
The students at the Jedličkovskyv school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they engage in fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough economic means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličk.v usedatav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert several groups and interpreters act.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will act.
For more detailed information, see www.kpks.cz.
Did you have any other similar "spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will be performing for the first time at the Pražské Jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, so far you have acted in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
So far, however, we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which always surprises me.
Even in Moscow, where we came back recently, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still no frequency that a person travels alone around the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in wheelchairs in elevators, there it is not.
Luckily, a civil association has been created that strives to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we're going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with serious disabilities to move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate actively in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap we go a little ahead!
A respectful society or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes when prominent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will begin to change everything.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we looked a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličk?v used it, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxofon, I joined an amateur group with a workmate.
And over time, as our moderator La Angelovič says, he left us a little bit of his hands (Laughter).
However, popularity has not come up until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us quite well to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that we don't see is as if it didn't exist.
Thanks to the aid from the European Union, we can also allow ourselves to be a teacher of quality, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something else can be done.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in his own way, that all new things are welcomed with caution and it takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who first sees us is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and those of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well with people with disabilities, then it is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole society.
Did you help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe it?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to try, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria leaves them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: La Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has will and will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through video conference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World, Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources necessary to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational centre without STUDEO barriers in Jedličk.v used by Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entry in the pre-sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second member country of the ESA of the former Eastern Europe bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during later years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, the path of Poland towards the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights prior to World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the conference by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the participants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was placed on one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a strip was built in Poland, which was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known, nor are the project outbreaks known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the drain or for its braking.
Information on this web is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the stored material, it is evident that the investigation reached the stage of the practical evidence.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photo-electric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Commitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all draft missile techniques for military use and coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The November 1954 issue of Problemmy magazine refers for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautics Society (PTA) had aspired to become a member of the International Astronautics Federation (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautics Federation.
He ran this post until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna) rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm long and did not reach 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 air tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets were initiated in the Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have an peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were differentiated by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Instituto Aeroeo, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was subsequently built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the CoSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the CoSPAR National Committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social labour law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with one another.
The cause is at the beginning of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of major differences on the labour cost (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this reason "proposes a drop" of the competitor's price in order to be made with most of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
On a large scale, it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where labour prices, compared to other economies, are higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, is not responsible for the unemployment caused by this phenomenon, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
All of this creates the total disinterest of employers in paying taxes and in compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of benefits.
The situation is so universally well known that no specific statistical data is required.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies in which Governments of those countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without taking account of the social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the private capital dictatorship, particularly in respect of wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees in respect of labour rights.
The result is increasing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already about one million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: people employed with such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German Federal Parliament was made public.
The savings measures of almost all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to make a bad living on the limit of society, hoping that one day they will reach the private investor capital country.
Do you have to ask yourself where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty goes from country to country or never arrives, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African continue to work for a small part of a European salary.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media affirm to the satisfaction that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which leads the economy to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by getting involved in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its selfishness in the political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in very powerful and omnipresent practice, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal companies, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is later passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with liberal orientation are quickly in a situation such as that described by Appianos in his work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had been disintegrating and the administrations occupied force."
In exchange for bribes, unlawfully obtained favors and help to fund stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread unhinderedly and people went to the polls with the beat vote beforehand... "there were no people in character who aspired to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be serious that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appianos thought of Pompey, Caesar went to power and turned democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that the present society is based on disregarded preferences of the individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is unable, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as then, a decline of the unprecedented elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next blow.
The real demolition fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Czech Republic government will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete sociopolitical reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That noting comes from violence and nothing ever flowd", Sting in his song Fragile and whose stilt prays "Let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my children wanted no war, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged as always.
One, on Israel's side, argues for the right to self-defence and encapsulates Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide against Palestinian Arabs and stains Israel of a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who benefits from the tensions that have been dragged for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small area of Middle East land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions to which I have come on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on whom or what group of people is the main driving force behind the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity the history of struggles for power is in the front row.
At every time we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if there was someone behind their throne who was guiding their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live at a time that concentrates the wealth of the world on the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but I do not discard): the Rothschilds.
It doesn't write much near them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great gravity. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which always meant strengthening.
They have important participations in almost all the central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, declared or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq they were 5, after the overthrow of Gadafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has sued the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschild Central Bank of America, began during the Session War to print money and was murdered in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was murdered in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
His desire for world power led them during the 1859 - 1871 years to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Albert Pike Mason, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second war wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third war aimed at reducing the population of the land between half a million and a billion people (like slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so much resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary project for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the wealthiest family group operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and they always lead to a worsening of the situation. Otherwise, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis such as that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after that, the First World War was unleashed, they destroyed zarista Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War suddenly ended and unjustified from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end the Czarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the land of the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a conflict situation following the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, creating optimal conditions for the radicalization of impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was sufficient for the Germans to serve the Führer solution, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to culprits, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority to represent and represent as well the role of the fifth column, which caught the flame and caused the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration laid the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks took place in both sides.
World War II broke out: it is hard to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope that international bankers had attached to him in the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for accepting the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and similarly the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers were able to start it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now along with the Arab population or, generally, Muslim of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also internationally. Let us take as an example how Israel’s supporters and detractors are divided in a tacit way.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at first it was the greed of some individuals and their hunger for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their representatives, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Ormuz Strait, where it passes 20 per cent of all world oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light is now shown the words David Rockefeller delivered in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls his whole being.
"And it obliges all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark in the right hand or in the front, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand this: whoever has two fingers in front of him adds the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo Film: If you get raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist students took up the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: throwing the shah on the edge could not be allowed, since, if it did, it jeopardized the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified further with the failed attempt to free hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the U.S., their fate caused a wave of solidarity and animadversion against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck themes an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before taking over the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping them with an extravagant story: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the production of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan presented by the expert on "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, fictional production society even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that turned out well, a deception (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film are combined moods. On the one hand we find well documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits there are emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, Hollywood's typical scenes are somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
Also, scenes from the CIA Central and other institutions: worn men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Friendly, Adios" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it grew up.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed directors of old movies above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran is "ruined" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of verdic events. The introductory sequence of taking the embassy is impressive because of its synoptic capacity which, at the same time, transmits the emotion of the confusion and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect on fictional scenes (the imposter team at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And they are pretty well arranged. Sometimes something adds to the reality: here doesn't come all in such an elegant way (the scene in which the crisis is covered at Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America and the unbridled search after its track become crazy).
The weakness of Argo is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of a dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, evaluate its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes in the 1970s.
But if it breaks down, that'll be hard.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresentity and omniscience of secret services may be, is sufficient.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who presents an annual survey of the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in executive positions in large European companies," explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organizer.
Among the so-called absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Up to now, women had better prices in life insurance because they were objectively at a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
Among the EU’s controversial regulations are, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of lifetime mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of dangerous substance or the dark guideline the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual prohibition of using the term "untar butter" or the removal of the classical bulb of trade has been criticized.
A quality banana must be 14 centimeter long.
The Union apparatus often takes this type of decision under pressure from one or another commercial or industrial lobby whose petitions in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that high-quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curves".
The European Commission argued that this only seeks to harmonise non-homogenised national standards so far, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of edibles.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU prescription of last year that in the inflatable balloons being marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction applies also to the use of maasuegras by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) should be mentioned.
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laiss Doing, nominated, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then surpassed, for example, the volume established for preserved mushrooms, which led to a threat of substantial fines.
The survey organizers were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the grant application.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We call on the European Union to make compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that in our country a lot of grain was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the stores full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was prepared to assist the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). In particular, it is intended to draw up applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
Member States' guidelines are often a target of criticism, EU regulatory efforts and more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve, according to a number of experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that the Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fiber, just as other countries in the Union are fighting for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious of these battles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc's request, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became known as "tuzemak".
Only products produced from sugarcane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected EU designations of origin, together with known feta and gorgonzola cheeses worldwide, the macapan of the German city Lübeck or Parma ham, there are already, for example, the Karlovy Vary cookies, the Pohořelice carp and Třeboň and even the variety of Žatec hops.
As protected maras from the EU, you will be proud of the gingerbread of Pardubice and the boats of Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did it happen to be presented to the elections for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't submit my application.
But I can no longer bear to see how it's stolen in our country in the last twenty years, how the thieves get unpunished, tax increases and retirement age increase.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has arrived, but soon thereafter it has been on its way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted on it?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I needed that if I was elected Senator, I would file my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
This is added to the media, which despise and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I'm said to have bribed journalists what I've been consulting with Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million.
To do so must change the law.
As President, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the leadership to be recognized as self-employment, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, either right or left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential for the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without matching or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be a man of right or left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me, either a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move on.
I don't care if anyone is on the right or on the left, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
He jokes about you being populist.
But you're not proving it by what you say?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or known experts speak of them.
But without the support of the parliament, he has only left orders.
And with this it cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will, for example, get criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other choice.
To persuade politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If he was elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And eventually they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character who points to disputes, pressure can be made on the political scene.
Let us take the direct election of the President, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I claim that I am only a fan, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I have just started in politics and I am trying to get as much support as possible for my programme.
I'm trying to get things straight myself, but in case it doesn't work out well, I'll leave it in six years and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura is saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with a person I don't do anything, so I've visited a number of known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported research journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought out the frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself starting from the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did so voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the untiring past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have any money.
I have no money for the campaign to the presidency, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
This is about property statements, how is it yours?
I love my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have an estimated land worth 25 million, an estimated 10 million floor, another eight million floor, an art collection worth 10 million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued by one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, was fighting evil and injustice.
Does he drive an Aston Martin, his property is valued at 60 million and he doesn't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I owe myself?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that there is not too much interest in my program.
And I don't have to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The costs of the campaign cover essentially what I will receive as Senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 krona a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So you'll continue your business activity so you can live?
Didn't you say before you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, in part I left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in spring.
People wanted me to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I'm still winning.
If I was president, then I'd leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "books mountain"- 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic aspect, and at last there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company near the library, points out: "in addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody likes to go into those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, has the dubious honor of having stood with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute somehow to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was how political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a whole master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings at pairing with cynics, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared at the competition's presentation in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked at perplexing around him and shrugged his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellows:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, the so-called `Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises at the expected location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and town buildings.
In early November, the book mountains were awarded with the second "Best Library of NL 2012" prize.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking history, which so far had nothing but to offer a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white façade one would rather intuit a dairy center, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese pan.
It is true that there is an elevator that carries us right to the center of this mountain mass, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but rather merge with their topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor collected and the elegant headlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
Upon raising the view you can see the park banks, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Usually the book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is we put up the classic spatial configuration and take the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and barandilla at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we met with the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of few millimetres of thickness has been used as a basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library this fabric was first caught in such quantities until it obtained plates of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells of a new car mix and sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of nearly 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the café there is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also you can enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment at the same time that maintains the air humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
"Although it is difficult to believe it given its large crystallized surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," Trouborst says.
The required heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge crystal pyramid, even in the most sunny days the sun shines only for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden circles located cross-sectionally on the glass façade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is about automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker in the Information Technologies sector, has already dared to put his foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Also, Chinese traditional medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul".
The reason is that, on the occasion of the opening that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete file; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has closed down.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows his book is part of the library.
Even though he's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a complete success in this queen discipline, which in the specialized argot is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uneducated it may be.
Finally, a starting point for conforming your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany has abstained from the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in U.S.-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany should be careful.
But at the same time, I do not believe that it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because he is currently reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led by the United States, so to speak, and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not accustomed to doing so.
I think they're still testing what their role will be, but they've already started the road to a "normal" foreign policy.
A similar foreign policy to countries such as France and Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, stands ready to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy has a strong motivation for economic policy, i.e. exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why it must be careful and not alienate from Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it so much importance since it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by refraining from voting in important decisions such as the Palestinian vote?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, German stance has a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think that there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to achieve a certain degree of respect.
After all, all this has done is to show that it is a country that takes seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. internal policy.
I think the Obama government is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I believe that the true disparity of views does not really have the extent to which it is attributed.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it has with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher body, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in future Germany will play a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it maintains with Israel.
This has always been a dangerous issue.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to play a leading role?
Or is it perhaps still hard for him to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to have a more important role to play.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany takes its position as the leading actor, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It is an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Given this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European policy is decreasing, but the EU is not currently covering that gap, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant to them or if it turns them into an even more unpopular people, it's life!

"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-famous brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name is hidden a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection while the true eponymous do not present a demand.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be right.
"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of Taylor Wessing's law firm specializing in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
The copyists simply add a couple of letters to be able to record their brands.
This way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens an archive in which it stores seats from Beijing's trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in that of copying and violating intellectual property rights is still known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are of a different nature. At the expense of its clients, it fights the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a denomination that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or a companion brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears, and the damage that the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year China is, in size, the third market of luxury goods and the one that grows at a higher rate.
However, making registrations of dubious legality in trademark registration is complicated and also a lot of money.
Processes can be extended up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had passed so long that the name subject to the request had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff has bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarism because the process has damaged China's brand," says Pattloch.
This is sometimes the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a complaint against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why today the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, used at first a white and blue logo that reminded BMW of much; the matter was settled in the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitationrs from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 there have been difficulties with the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the work emergency situation returned to normal."
Thus, the number of unprocessed claims has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year the TMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and it means that China leads the list of new inscriptions worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, as the trademark office points out.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been reimbursed for rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese copyist.
While the Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the impersonator has managed to secure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"We have provoked this situation ourselves because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the use of municipalities.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg has been justified, but the opposite side continues to fight today.
We need to be very careful.
The case has now reached the gates of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending resolution.
Wentzler was confident that the issue could be resolved favourably and praised the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to 100 years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered to the opposite side a "six-digit sum in euros" in order to reach a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
"This demonstrates how much we care," says Wentzler.
The dangers they face in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
In particular, if copyists ensure rights on unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long abandoned this trade area, but has been able to prevent registration.
"We must be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and counsel Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious in doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what needs to be done is "to record in China everything that may be susceptible to protection," as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposite part license rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dance, Sing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir and in Swaziland, the orphans of AIDS rejoice.
The story of a bond capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to slowly raise the voices of the singers (contalto, bass, tenor and soprano), retaliating, becoming numb and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes by trying to put order with his strong and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
Fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years of age, have also arrived from human geneticist to homeowner.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and also in a foreign language only known: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Self-help
According to one UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS Programme worldwide has approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already seropositive.
The Voice for Africa association has found in Germany godfathers for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can pair a child.
This contribution will cover the school registration, the uniform and will guarantee you a hot daily meal at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirista".
In this room no one can speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been trying songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers on a straight line from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a people called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40 per cent of the people of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with something over thirty years has become a habit.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this large population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which since then has professionally dealt with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
ETS of bacterial origin include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Ladillas and sarna are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more often given in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute forms part of the basis that at least four out of every five cases of Syphilis registered in Germany are caused by sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, tricomones, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hongus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of Syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
There were approximately 2,700 cases in 2011.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urination disorders, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect?
condoms may reduce the risk of contagion, but do not offer 100 per cent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections due to dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if it is frequently changed as a sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most TSEs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, of the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the Zodwa Dlamini village itself a woman sure of herself and with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogogos", as the older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where to live and take care of children attending school every day and wearing their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for over 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, has built two chickens and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to have many of the people undergoing HIV testing.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is throughout the country, it is not often openly spoken of.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, king Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficial way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless timers who travel the country from one side to another and who take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "anywhere you can get free condoms, but these are only used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin contact against skin."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years south of Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost extreme of the African continent still remember of the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a language of blacks; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent environment and much joy, but has also managed to tear out a couple of tears to some other angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children of the state.
Although this small population barely appears on the maps, in the Ezulweni River Valley is well known.
"Draw near to Esitjeni, there shines the light," the local people say.
And after walking around the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury · Global Voices
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Although it is the planet closest to the sun, there is also iced water, as it emerges from three studies published on Thursday in the specialist magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the zone of the planet that is permanently in the shadow a layer of ice has been formed.
It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably derived from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that in their day clashed with Mercury.
No one connects the finding of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
Temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other life components have reached other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.

This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "born" stars.
This region of star formation, unsavoryly called by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This sunny image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.

Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the Southern European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located several thousand light years in the Sagittario constellation.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), as dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this star formation area into three lobes.
At the Ofiuco constellation, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: at 400 million light years of the Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the fusion process are balanced towards each other to end up crashing irremediablely.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Southern Molinillo.

This star formation area constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Nebula Roseta, new stars are also constantly emerging; at 5,000 light years of Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found mainly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescope Canaries located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is equal to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of Arecibo Radiotelescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.

Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected that you will be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on Mauna Kea's Hawaiian volcano were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a 30-meter mirror diameter.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidates for planets had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers start from the base that there is ice in Mercury's southern pole as well.
However, there is no powerful evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first orbiting Mercury, now scientists are sure that it is.

The trip through the mountain region of Talysh could qualify as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great strept through the sinuous road that passes next to forested hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are located in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of which not much is known, besides that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azeri and that are very long.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city boasts a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit entirely into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometres that separate both urban cores, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth the country enjoys thanks to Caspian oil has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilatea Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the World's Oldest People," says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have been over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of hers died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we consider that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"Born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. It seems he still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Was it wrong then Şirali Müslümov at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunz Valley in Pakistan there are also very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; most of all, when there is no civil record.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a Biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azeri tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of talyshi.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
From a nutritional point of view, however, it does not seem logical that precisely the food rich in calories of talyshi, who love meat, bread and above all milk products and many of which, besides, drink daily a bowl of butter melted, be so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97 he is relatively young for what is spread through these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves tirelessly a huge tin of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's children and one of Mirzayeva's daughters, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play from one side to another two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in typical glasses with an abombed shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long braids of dark red hair that his son finds us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, which is why I've never fallen and kept its color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been shopping at a supermarket all my life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II period.
However, everything came back to its handle when the "beloved father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult that professes to the paternal figure of the nation, which governs its country as a dictator, knows no bounds.
It remained in power until 2003, when the witness handed over to his son Ilham.
At least older people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, a quantity with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son is right: "in our culture the older are very respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression “Human Rights”
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Events that rival each other in Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is sinking.
The future constitution, with the sharia as the basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare himself in patetism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially to Christian Coptics, liberals, illustrated Muslims and seculars.
All of them, who have gone up without remedy so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile because of the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend its powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean as "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that it has been set up, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what suggests a new article added: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be that way, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh repression of the opposition.
Up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons after the dictator's fall.
As set out in the draft, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
This is so inaccurate in legal terms that with the help of this article State institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly is nothing but censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacy.
However, it is unclear what an offense is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits "offense to people"
Is a president's cartoon enough or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Morsi for signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks, the opposition has been closing ranks in front of Islamists' superiority.
Ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir del Cario Square and vowed to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up defeating," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who occupies the third place on the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the cube of the waste of history".
Through Twitter he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy".
"When you call the referendum we will go to your palace and overthrow it," says opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been purified," was mentioned in the Egyptian media to the political opponent Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a countermanifestation; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer across the Nile, to the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it in the cry of: "the people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Morsi to "clean up the country," while proclaiming: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim brothers stated that both those opposed to the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now it would have been time for the people to decide which direction the country should follow.
In this regard, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," regrets a conversation with the newspaper 'Welt am Sonntag'.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers of the State made this lawyer resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Rather than strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolishing it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protestant in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian Rakfisk: the world's most lousy fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has any connection to its greed for an extremely illustrious fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothing.
Leave him there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisiteities.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowing. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is trout in parlor that lets itself ferment in water during, depending on how painful you prefer it, up to a year.
As it darkens and gets colder, the Norwegians come in troupe to a festival that is celebrated here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this food of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"It eats raw and then drinks a glass of a drink aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, fireman of the city who is also known as the "General of the Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking an important amount of drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," says Harvard.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a portion of sushi who has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty hit Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, fish were kept during the fall immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it emerges and, evidently with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is rising rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A current of residents of Sweden, the old rival and not much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential part, although quite ill, of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich costs you 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme right racist who shot and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to shooting as "the event of 22 July".
It is hard for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's present wealth, the growth has grown since the early 1970s of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as she passes rakfisk trays and that, with her long blonde melancholy and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like bragging, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they did not have during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
"While we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carcassed development.
I'm in the snow tailing for something to eat; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a hamburger is definitely something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, that lousy fish returns.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many locals where a rakfisk dinner is celebrated where comers vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nasal pits.
A TV has connected live with a pajarita presenter who is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like Eurovision's competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Harvard."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto Faces a Hard Start · Global Voices
While Mexico's incoming President, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take over his office, BBC correspondent Will Grant, analyzes the challenges to be faced by the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested itself, a circle of steel has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has achieved good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged into a war on drug trafficking that has already been charged about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Department.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before co-operating with the U.S. President, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his birth state, Mexico.
A very populated state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory where he used to move.
A Honest Man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of tourism growth in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which means a huge improvement compared to the paved roads and full of berries that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plates with their name at the entrance of a modern sports club and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust he can make a real and lasting change," says his political friend and ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, Member of the party of Mr Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"Particularly, as far as security and economics are concerned, we expect the interesting and true change that our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was disbanded by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the qualification that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic state man and, above all, he's a person who can hear."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the narrow streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway tracks is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of women killed have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Critics from Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he was unable to address the problem of feminicide while in charge.
The most critical accuse their administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I came home, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned up," recalls Mrs. Buenda.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, next to a cross on which one word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
"The state authorities treated me like an old joke, a bully, a cheesecake.
What they want is for you to just accept what they say and shut up."
"But that can't be so when there have been so many irregularities and neglect," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope it's the same kind of president he was when he was a governor," says PRI Olvera's deputy in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza most fear.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, as prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during his stay in prison
The trial focuses on the Manning period in Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while he was under military arrest.
During the interrogation conducted by the prosecution at Manning in a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits by officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing held following the defence's request to dismiss the case since its imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already assumed sufficient punishment, arrived one day after Manning had testified that he had planned to commit suicide while he was in custody.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers filled out after visits to Manning during their arrest at the military prison in Quantico, where he was imprisoned in maximum prison from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and noted their answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the captors as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about certain issues and that the officers visiting him had talked about those problems and had indicated that they would be addressed, but that they had not left a record of those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidences' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I didn't mention any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council to examine the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was found.
The military said they had placed him under this restrictive regime, which is below the level of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure their protection and safety for others.
"I wanted the older state to know that I was okay and (I wanted to) stop being under injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at sea base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost knowledge because of heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning stated that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a chandelier, some clothes and glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming out pointing to his eyes while he was asleep.
He said that if the captors couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal claim in January 2011 on the treatment he received Manning.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about a claim he had made in his statement on Thursday, according to which, after having been forced one night to sleep naked in his cell of Quantico, he was forced during a morning counting to stand naked in front of the lockers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced by the order given to him by the locker that he should drop the blanket with which he could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his chandeliers to self-injure himself but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed from his cell his underwear, his chandeliers and his glasses.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he spent during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted in the war council, which is expected to start early next year.
The defence stated that it plans to have Manning found guilty of minor crimes and to defend other accusations considered too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention are justified.
The Pentagon has claimed that Manning was retained in accordance with the rules of application for any detainee who is in maximum custody in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully provoking the publication of information on the Internet, filtering of national defence information and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
Affirms that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who have gone; says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had hardly gone down the plain and reached the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicoans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
When I grew up in Central California, all my life I've been called Mexican.
It's ethnic tachograph, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
Later, I decided to become Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, tachographing or scripts were not necessary.
He was just American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have a native's vocabulary level and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as long as the leaders of these two countries meet, there was immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also wishing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment a Mexican is so likely to stay in Mexico like he ventures to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create in North America a trade bloc in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to yield half of its territory to gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think of centuries, not minutes, the elements they remember are everywhere.
So, at a time when a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Moctezuma are on the rise to war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that of more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or any of the grandparents, to whom the door of opportunity was shut in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fits into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are his descendants and are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now be living the American dream, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this rock between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first ones know more strongly who they are and the second thing bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love to hear about the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico you see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I've found out during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and push political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with unequal wages, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna keep them alone with this idea, guys.
Fair enough.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still upset about how their families were treated much less.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who first started, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
Arab spring has left everything that they like or don't like, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional boom.
Maybe this makes your fight even more bloody than it used to be.
However, there are reasons to believe that their lethal dead-point situation could be disintegrated.
A war that won't be lost or won
At first sight, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is maintained, this week's clashes have strengthened the halcons of both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders could conclude that time is playing in his favor.
Since Islamists have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a reborn regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas' joyful members say that the Islamist average moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbula militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populated and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas' cousins and their leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have placed Hamas on their site.
Israel's Iron Summit missile system has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep calmer... for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the United States is more firm than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, partly thanks to the barrier that runs through the West Bank, the main part of an aspirant territory to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite illegal international legislation.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Lukud has joined an even harder line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why pamper those Palestinian twists by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, would they not shoot rockets like their fellow countrymen in Gaza?
Better keep them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they lift their heads.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel too much, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire out is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography makes the situation worse as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that calls for sensible people from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel's assignment of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the cease-fire gives a little more impetus to the people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to stop the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to submit his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to devote his attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light up on boxes of a green off colour, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with a wrapper of an olive green blackout, frightening images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies as children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory from Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small source type.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government states that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating traits that make this habit glamorous.
He trusts in studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from an early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Pibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would foster the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco the counterfeiters will bring from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that your business has benefited from the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for snacks and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been shot almost since zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law at the Australian Supreme Court.
She stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was waiting for more stocks.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws banning advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you sell tobacco and you only have this small window left to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews of brands from "foot-to-foot citizens" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It is worth asking whether it is just a private citizen who actually loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what new regulation implies than on marketing.
Industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plubersek stated that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
"The photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"Take the cigarette and save the pack," says Victor El Hage while buying a pack with the image of a tumor in your mouth.
"To be honest, there's only one reason I'd stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to put them in the shelves.
"It usually took an hour to dissipate a delivery; now late four," says Yu.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it's already, okay, it's over and we close the store," he says as he lifts his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to bore a little
During the Thanksgiving parties this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying suffered from a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
To spend half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting about duty-free stores.
But more and more scholars and children development experts are praising the kindness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in a good spirit?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, it was assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompey there are graffiti in Latin about the boredom that dates back to the first century AD.
We should also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and raising the idea before a discussion group consisting of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting, but not being able to participate in an activity that fills you".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do anything but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly."
Boring can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, boring people tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be their problem.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Uninvolved Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants heard a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the next room a TV program at all volumes that kept no relationship, others listened to it with the low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the low volume program showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, attention disorder can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or doing garabats, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it is to be bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a "strengthening scale to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at West Florida University, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human development and community development at University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which 400 adolescents were contacted and their parents from seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said he was bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when he was not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they would get bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest quotas," largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, returning to my first question: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can make us expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into substance consumption as a method of combating it, as evidenced by research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way your brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to do so," says Professor Fenske.
And "this dosage capacity applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But neither should we be too critical of him.
Rather, our objective should be to feel comfortable from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of looking, we need to get bored more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing desire to relate it to something that deserves it," he says.
It points out that what people really seek is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when noise stops."
Colorado: without instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community and football institute in Southeast Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe that he used to smoke.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, on the plains near Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related articles (minor crimes involving each of them a fine of 100 US dollars) in which he was informed about the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes for drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes due to marijuana possession are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have no longer filed charges against those over 21 years of age for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed themselves to moving forward with the open cases of marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly authorized marijuana shops from being opened in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, right east of Denver.
Those in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacture, distribution and sale licenses; all this before the deadline arrives on 1 December 2013.
They say that for good or bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states regarding regulation of marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colored has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work.
"There is no true precedent that serves as a model," he says.
The law of Washington, I-502, comes into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition on cannabis business on a radio of less than 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal cannabis, a newly created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, the chief of police of Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would cease to file judicial proceedings for mild misconduct due to marijuana possession to persons over 21 years of age and that the police would cease to file charges against such crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the city's regulations regulating marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
At present, 119 people are faced with charges of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal proceedings against those shortcomings that occurred at the time they were a crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, district attorney of the county, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the outstanding cases for possession.
"I don't think he's wasting his time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials in relation to the great environmental experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier with district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the accused for marijuana possession and who is a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on marijuana.
"They've spent so much time taking people to the courts that they can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become testing cases at the national level in terms of the legalization of drugs.
While state lawyers and officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving directions from the federal government, which still envisages the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
The advocates of legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give in.
Despite the fact that some outstanding arrests of marijuana patients and sellers have occurred for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed most of them to sell marijuana for these purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
"Although anti-drug agents are likely not to pull down doors to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow the operation of state-controlled stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a drug policy exaggerator of Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the day of the elections, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted for in favour of what the state voted for."
Many questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I got kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory."
You don't attack university students for your views just now
I don't remember any time in my life when I haven't been dreaming about getting a seat at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to run the history race, I had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard stated that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some college colleagues having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson said he was joking that I had gone because I was forced to drink in uncooked cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because it came from a private school.
They harassed me for only one reason, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration proved intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what that comes to now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-central students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the conservative party was such at Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (group of graduate students) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously, personally attacked and treated as non-grateful people" for their political ideas.
They want to establish a position on the Equal Opportunities Committee of their college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, Bright and Right) on student politics and which presented Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
He showed the graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a staff with the silver handle.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" for the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Nottingham University, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of left-wing in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and history student at Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old and elected president of the OUCA, says that the attitude of JCR members towards people who are in the right center has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
For my first few weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, she was a very shy 18-year-old.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causa" after cuts in the funding of higher education.
The environment would have startled any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness I expected.
I discovered that not only did the professors look fat to the ridicule of conservative university students, but they were willing to participate in it.
The policy of miners strike, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the workshop's wooden rooms.
The first one I attended was to translate 18th-century French texts into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Mr. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Don't say one.
Pitt, a low man with a face who looked like a bizcocho mass, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Are the thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other colleges laughed.
I was burned in the eyes of the tears I was trying to hold.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt said.
I came back to my room like a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner at the university; then I felt a slight slap on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OAUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspicious of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be laborers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardlyly to conceal.
I insisted that you didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" asked one.
"They beat each other, didn't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me only after nightfall?
Should I become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
He was hated not only by the Conservative party, but also by Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered him provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began to travel from Oxford daily to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my relatives and friends of more open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear sleeping needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give her another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
It would break my heart if you let it go."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminary where another professor of history had insinuated, speaking completely seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old."
The truce lasted only a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career in Oxford.
By then my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was in a frenzy of fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed the suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you'll call me weak cry.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party but is now hiding behind a reputation which is not worthy of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this during the inauguration of "Valentine: Master of Costura", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 high seam dresses created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without their distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rabid and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most grenade of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social promotion: of humble modist of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they don't wipe the collars of their drops on your magnificent rug as they do some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to their villa in Gstaad," explains ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, playing a Valentine's Day
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of modisto.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on its floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each guest made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Costuration Week in Paris in 1995.
"It never goes fashion because its designs are works of art," he ends.
Acronyms Show
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions, but of well-represented love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the gateway to contemplate a dream "hearing" that lights Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumer who used Monica Vitti in "The Night", or a wool and skin coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this mannequin audience, names such as those of Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and modisto, 2006
Many of those customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "not able to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," added the former Duchess of Fairy.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and they're "donors" on your face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriptor Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenbergtampo can not forget the first time she saw a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting old and the opportunity to wear one of your night costumes...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with fly skirt, "corsage" flagged and listen to word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her modist party dresses with "maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, it's also the set of memories she wears."
The "king" of fashion
The grand end of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding costume with Pablo from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girlfriends" (as the modist calls to their seams) to develop this ivory silk suit with pearl incrustations, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the high seam of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obnubilated for years with the elite's "being-to-being", Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of its clients' husbands.
"He has always drawn attention to his refinement, his calm, his pure and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time didn't pass to him."
If a princess says so...
The world's hardest trade: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by charging 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another that literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by sucking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, you have to descend every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas that emanates from the Earth’s bowels is solidified by entering into contact with the air.
After booting large sulphur rocks, which in total reach about 70 kilograms, carry them in two bamboo baskets that carry on their shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb by step of turtle, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to swing and fall by the cliff.
They know that any transpire could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who spent years ago for the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro per kilo of sulphur they extract
Once above, they take a step between tourists photographing them as circus monkeys and, charging the heavy baskets fatigue, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has placed a little below, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for each kilo of sulphur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture eyebrows, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As usual it is to load 70 kilograms, we take some 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries three daily doors.
It takes three hours in each and ends up wet, but allows you to add 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what I would gain in the field.
"The miners' newspaper is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2 euros) on the day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros) ", explains the carrier, who previously worked as a masonil on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the bowl was not so hard, but then he returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town close to the volcano, for a weight reason that, in Indonesia, it turns out as loud as sulphur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to become Islam."
Then he has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, then he's been playing the skin on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to pass his bill despite covering his face with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in English more than acceptable.
Punished by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a rough wooden hut with other carriers, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur does not stop eating at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defiing the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater falling with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers carry the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supply any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and thus the weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) of charging per camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (€1.2), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for animals and not for people," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old supplier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Capable of raising up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will endure working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years of age.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulphur burns the throat and chooses the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and sores in the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket over your back, Unainik can now only charge 50 kilos to its 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions take 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat's path between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims opening his mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works carrying sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the world's hardest trades: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and cost of property and education for having no children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an ad of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bowl (boil) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, has the hope that with the advertisement they will get to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform "his national duty".
This is something purely on the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing evenings of quick appointments (speed-dating).
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do our best to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is Singapore's government.
Spending $1.300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and shares tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was over 2 - known as a replacement rate - was 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, says that it is due to a "better education" and "a broader range of career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration to deal with population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia is just disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and not being integrated.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling in the birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved on to control the number of small apartments, known as "box of shoes", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says his "slip boxes" are sold much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units wear out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, to whom they were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center seems to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man about 20 years old.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of property and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government is trying to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to babymaking, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off line is private online
Privacy.
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary it is about the quality of privacy or "the privacy area that is entitled to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply to your daily life and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers to those who are exposed to ventilating situations on the Internet that would probably not share offline?
The Journal interviewed five boys between 10 and 15 years of age, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", in the personal plane, and "in the key and name of the user", when applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not upload them to a post," says ten-year-old Jorge when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been accounting for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everyone," he says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I'm having fun with my acquaintances, too.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or someone who's making the joke," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, of naked persons, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just raise them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
No doubt you would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to anyone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people added on his list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his home or phone number.
"If I was pressured or required simply by the bags of my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A acquaintance of a friend of mine was extorting him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"I never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to José, didn't close the bill.
"He only put her privacy."
Then explain a number of steps to safely configure the account.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
If I do, if I fall bad or you're hungry.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, the purpose of social networks should be to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to seek information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he said.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a teacher in Pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the theme is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on whether or not to disseminate, publish or tell an age that maturity does not give for that."
"Even though they are selective when what they care most about is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents privacy is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you published from a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people to tag them?
And one more, everyone needs to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to let them see that they must act online as they do off-line.
They're the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it should be on social media," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a primary teacher and an educational consultant, says that it is essential for family parents to read social media policies.
By understanding each of the subparagraphs they have solid grounds for talking to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is important to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers".
End the Unasur Summit without making public the Lima Declaration
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Declaration of Lima, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant representatives.
Ef tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Foreign Affairs and Presidency pointed out at an early stage that was to be delivered after the closure, but later stated that it will be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
Access of journalists to the Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information he circulated among the reporters was delivered by press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the appointment, although not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is Humala's pronouncement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the III Summit of Arab South America (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite the urgent demand of the press, neither was the so-called Lima Declaration announced before.
On ASPA's official website, it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure secure transmission systems for all journalists, but limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a decision by the Hague Court to settle a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they would respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations from both sides, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will act and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are taking to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean couple.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," he added Piñera, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the judgements of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua which it seriously considered to be wrong.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will "take important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residency agreements".
He reported that efforts are being made to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-priced Internet access in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphal matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas...using our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian president in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the cross-sectional axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not provide further details.
The outcome document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to re-enter the Union of South American Nations", of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, President Juan Manuel Santos, President of Colombia, said before beginning his participation in the regional appointment he hoped to meet with his partner from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute respectfully after a decision by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will be found Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc defence ministers met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal where "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a country".
In that regard, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship to encourage the Unasur member countries.
"It is necessary to achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also expressed support for the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give a chair never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding," stated Ecuador's founder Julian Assange, in reference to political asylum.
Correa assured him that he is not sorry for this decision because he has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process would not be respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding him to be subjected to interrogation on his territory for a alleged sexual offence when "Swedish law itself allows it to be carried out through videoconferencing, which could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian representative said.
What is there is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate because you are confined to a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"That complicates the health of anyone," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a lifeline that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there has been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is doing a number of procedures in different European instances," he said.
And he said, "If Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this ends."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him via Skype tomorrow this problem is over.
Correa took advantage to reaffirm herself as a press freedom defender and nuanced that what does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect it was welcomed that these journalists are no longer "the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries dominating Ecuador," and it advanced that if they were re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and the coupsm covered by legality" because it actually "destructed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries following the judgement of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, that ruling is not clear.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be processed in a broad way to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime limits that maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and believed that "it is right for Latin America to seek international authorities if the two countries undertake to accept judgement as hard as it is".
With reference to the possibility that he is a candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard."
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement thought it was me who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
Winning would be my last period in the presidency and from there we left public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan vice president Nicolás Maduro and told me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that he was expected to go through the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The head of Ecuadorian State today participated in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if I dropped a bomb," he refers to recalling the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "more smooth", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his birthday 43.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit at Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of his illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least in the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affect to the immune system that patients present at the start of the diagnosis, with a better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that anyone who receives a positive diagnosis of HIV at the age of 25, under these terms "while keeping in control can live without problems up to 75," the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it is worth recalling that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May of this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't had the problem with medication. The problem is that patients get very advanced because they don't know their condition of infection, i.e., in late stages of the disease.
He gave a strong data: "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection, what they have to do to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make early diagnoses and, therefore, they have to offer mass detection tests to all those who require it."
Specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida) agree in their proposal, also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to test a particular laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite his short age, was already in the AIDS phase and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die already, I'd better come back three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, eat me well, exercise, take the drugs.
To date, her parents only know that she had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"Working, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but it's responsible, I care for myself and the other person," Fabrizio said, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISSCO to motivate his testimony to those who today, within the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let the test be done, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone, be responsible.
That, your message, summarizes the battle slogan for AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Great are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a Tapatio journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "there has indeed increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of one hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sweat and value trials of social workers, school guidance workers, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator assured.
I proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only behind the exhibitors and those 100 are found in public bathroom dispatchers of the sites that young people attend.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the scissors and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking him if he would have distributed condoms in his administration.
"So it's not sexuality, it's best to approach condoms to those who already engage in sexual activity," he said.
Jalisco Keys
There are 13,435 cases accumulated (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the contagions correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there are 4 to 5 people in a registered case who do not know.
Ratified by an appeal court in the United States that does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a trade contest in Mexico, the scenario sets a bad precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures for survival of signatures that permit Mexican laws are invalid in the country of bars and stars, as opposed to international conventions.
In the practical field, the follow-up to the judgment issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankingrotas for the northern district of Texas, leaves defenceless to Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of embargo of their properties in coaching the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the United States Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
While the judge in the case points out that creditors must be governed by the Bankruptcy Act of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings is the trade contest processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on Uniform International Trade Law was created, and the American Law Institute was appointed as referee.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the inter-companies vote, recognized in the critical mass of the trade contest the debts held by the Vitro subsidiaries with their parent, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-companies debts supported the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The fact is, moreover, that by withdrawing the votes of the subsidiaries, however, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, i.e. the "good" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The fact is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, this blames Vitro for the difficult situation that he faced since 2008 on the basis of the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, hitting the country's collections.
Soon, the signing of the González Sada family will bring an appeal for reconsideration before the appellate court itself to get the vote to the plenary, that is, the five judges, since they only voted three.
If it does not succeed, the appeal of Cerciorare, which requires the review of the case by a higher instance, will be sought in this case by the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court suspended a document sent by the Government of Mexico as a friend of curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competition Act, noting that it was disenfranchised with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to match it with Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, that is, the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: hit Vitro and hit the country.
General Balance
For several months the complaints placed on the table by Mexican aviation unions against the company's ex-husband, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of the Union of Aviation Pilots already found the bottle neck.
The court headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Values Commission for whom it is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Attorney General's Office on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from Bank's trust F/589 IXE, on behalf of Mexican aviation, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're looking for Dragon Mars.
Meeting on the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members in general civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal center of sale and distribution towards Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with an area of housing to the lime for employees of 150 companies.
The Canacintra had previously managed to unify the governors of the south-east to oppose the monumental thing that swept away with part of protected areas and raised the mother of all the bitters against industry.
ACTA died
Soslayed by the government a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action was given despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex

Integrated by NYCE companies, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in information technology, has just been born a consortium with competitive social reason, whose aim will be the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The basketball has been my life"
Trotamundos del basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years attached to the board sport and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local basketball history as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was a minor player, a national basketball player, seized and leader at the BSN with the Bayamón Vacceros or president of the basketball Federation.
"I put many hats on basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a first hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball was my life."
Kings does not exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive trajectory, thus attesting to him.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, those who cherish with the greatest emotion are those who remember their passage through the Vaccines from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years of age acting as a co-powered or taken over from franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the chance to be a part of eight cowboy championships since 1967, whether as a takeover, a co-powered or a leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, the debut year of Jerome Mincy at the BSN.
From then on he took charge of "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had headed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong player, 6"7" height.
Do you want it?"
And that was Mincy's principle, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended to sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The cowboys' championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already in the distance, for by 1988 it was already a more federative mandarin.
For that time I preferred to enjoy their executions and those of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the pre-olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived fourth place and it must have been bronze not to be by that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is this 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a toast to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze in the world.
This team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, to the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been in the 90s because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995 Preolympian in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Snows, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner to replace the players suspended by the mess of the Silver Sea Pan American, we win gold against all predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt that was Piculin Ortiz.
Its numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that without telling his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who's been the best bouricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
It had been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What did you have to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, Ponce boys only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the island in national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessary.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, officers and arbitrators.
That's nice of me.
What are you doing now?
What I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who's always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world-famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, best known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a man of business without scruples, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family release provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., home producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked the most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her publicity officer Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
It was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss you very much.
"He was an original person and lived his life to the fullest," Gray said in a communiqué.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it he interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
She was also the protagonist of two comedies that were short-timed in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included papers well received by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his highest starry.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in betting houses.
He also helped give the series a record of the audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million television viewers tuned it and converted to "Dallas" in the second most visible entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with cheating as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a devious businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s stone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone "heavy, inside and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and one sixth was in process, reported the chain.
There was immediately no pronouncement by Warner or TNT on how the lost Hagman will handle the series.
Born from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who stared classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage with counsel Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck in New York theatres early in the 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought I was going to hurt someone or affect them somehow," said the Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation he became a organ donor and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a little while, but you're gonna be okay."
He was also an activist against the habit of smoking and participated in several campaigns.
They start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor in religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible anchor: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have held themselves as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he was expecting in the next couple of months: Hurricane Cataclysmic Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "dedermagedón" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of the times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been," Charmé said this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, assistant professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Mediums, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vaker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the history professor of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option of giving the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "near ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the same night as the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"He got tired in two hours," Restall said about his course for high average students, who filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a question of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard about a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe on the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and somehow discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior year student at Temple, 21 years old and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he claimed that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back to several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a rise in these speculations.
"On other sides people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about some course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, insinuating an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final trial have been talked about, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to think immediately on the next date" or to imply that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they're going to parties "of the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, 20-year-old communications student.
