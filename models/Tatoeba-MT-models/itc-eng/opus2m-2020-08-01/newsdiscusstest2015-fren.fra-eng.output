UKIP remains who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him whether people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specific arguments, then you discredit them with a barely veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to tail behind the chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-winged, does not exist virtually.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
Mail didn't write the report, he just made it comment.
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should be shot for propagating such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with homophobia charges.
Farage's sentence was very surprising, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to make it happen.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
We speak of it so rarely because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as bad in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes the austerity period, nothing will have been arranged.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland was the ''TIGRE DE L'EUROPE'', which we were proud of a few years ago.
We've known the rest!
This begins to read the article again.
Ireland is a virtuous country and a ''' NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE''' is taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, imposed on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible work path, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients not what '' paving''' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 80s of the 20th century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with Portugal, considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long calm river, it is on sight of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If a report is believed to be issued in 2008 or 2009, it is paid less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has recovered enormously, and there are new (and expensive) cars all around the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, and the recovery is evident in the day-to-day plugs since the return.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon be on fire.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hanging on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of appliances, so some bags and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said I'm stealing with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two once it's gone.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay a supplement to passengers for the additional fear that we were willing to provide?
But without that kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give themselves a great deal of joy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic rate only have to take themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was an error of the airport's air controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your compensation dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and gruels literally of the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (some, most) or for the Salon de la magazine à l'Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With many foreigners who spend .....
Do you think Sunday's opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are opened on Sunday, a world drink with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy on a discount.
Tourism areas lose considerable turnover each year for the same reasons .
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows for lower prices.
Dominal rest is a right which benefits, except for exceptions, employees.
This is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs has the least competence to reform the Labour Code.
As they wrap it up.
What is the use of the law?
To satisfy some of the population and businesses who want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday, I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal bible is opened 4 days a week but not the we!
That is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if her daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay for her estate?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
Surely his estate would like his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And its hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and its fascist ideas as a whole and also add its well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He kept in mind the other government aristos who wanted to discuss a "agreement" with the Nazis and he won very well.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and his energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had for these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to gather the money of inheritance costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the moment of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure yards being by definition unrenewable.
With regard to social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the true evil of France: the mistrust towards dialogue
Return to principal values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest among us not be in need!
Either we assist him, or he has DROIT in exchange for the services he renders or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the tenant who lives income from his property.
There is a need to differentiate the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives on his pensions.
A property to rent or two for a couple on top, it's vice
The little genius of finance is particularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortage in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-teamed.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild decline so brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is screaming: isolation, renewal of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc.
Taxation that promotes high incomes and rents.
Who's in charge?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallop.
Samsung's benefits are undermined by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all those phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's sake.
I believe that it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put in place this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
Besides, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their underlying philosophy and I like design.
Some people attach no value to design, for them options, functionality and price first.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and needs to be encouraged.
This is of our interest to all.
I'm glad you found out exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, are fighting ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Parisian fools) could tell us which author they are fighting ideas about gender and indicate to us the works they understand to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their source is Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're someone who's smart and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato recalling Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I don't have his vibrancy of mind).
Otherwise, in the "back", since you send it back, this subject doesn't interest me, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I was hoping you and your friends could get me out of my arrears, because I'm slow but I understand...
@Jean: recognize that culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, that is.
Who's afraid to ask the World?
But what are we afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us response elements.
The first by invoking Judith from the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic slitter of throat.
You can see how close these studies are to them.
We are obviously no longer in the debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read,Jean,that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To propose to fight ideas from the only exposition that their detractors make (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of Gender Theory or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not on the other hand that he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic slitter of throat, I was content with the "Second Sex" (it was more than my time) which is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I looked at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon showed up briefly when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and made up for some disappointment that sometimes the sight was blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really lock up Victoria and NSW's coast, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will make it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with it, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the rain of the Perseids and for virtually all of the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things get much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on that eclipse.
WHO LOOKS at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he (must) ends up missing?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed with EUX.
Beautiful picture of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is going to hit the Earth!
Nothing on stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing on inequalities between labour income and capital.
Nothing on tax fraud.
Extra liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these claims are not given.
There is no hypertext link to the original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Let us see today on Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miraculous revenues: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece the stock exchange collapses.
However, it seems that there are examples to follow.
Notaries reform would generate a demand for compensation for the EUR 8 billion.
The Department of Economics says that these claims for compensation are not well founded.
What if the Ministry of Economics has made a mistake?
Will decision makers who have made the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
The suite in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL.
@lol No the state is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget because the temporal horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is covered by the life of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered unproductive, they contribute to financing material and immaterial investments in future growth and hence future revenues.
A few responses.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrate: the health of the profits of world pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands linked by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
In fact, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
doctors don't make money with drugs Since Liberals want our health system to look like the United States, you should know how it works.
All over the world doctors are brokered in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
Perhaps it was wrong to blame the tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the profits of businesses and to "research".
So read the few reports on our pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies with other countries.
Compare the world prices of drugs everywhere, as well as the differences between countries on what is on sale or only on orders.
This reinforces it is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the necessary laws and expensive permits.
Although manufacturers of some medicines may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those that are able to produce good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you madam, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on in the backstage for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the flea in the ear of a hospital manager.
We can't keep patents on grass...
If researchers in social sciences did research instead of politics and networking, they could use their "work".
One investigator investigates, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
Comparing is making pedagogy out of research.
We can't say "research is a result it must be applied" and then in the same jet "we have to experiment with everything."
If your research has been completed, why experiment?
If your research has not been completed, why do you ask for them to be applied?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn if they learn how to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the use of building an indicator that informs you of what's going on, self-promotion, deception?
One track to train teachers: to move away from training sophists and ideologists and that practitioners teach practitioners.
manufacturing connects the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most inefficient conservatism: "It is a device that leads primarily to the reproduction of the practices in force, and does not allow to advance the system."
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be desired that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in modern teacher training
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to the theorists of education would ultimately destroy it.
Your analogy is totally bold: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would even like to have myself operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and has learned about the task.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP responsible for combating the violation of copyright by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR thank you.
If I ever begin to feel guilty of violating copyright, I will just read an article like this one.
In an information economy, violation of copyright = theft.
It is the same because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not the same.
Using content without proper license, you deprive artists of their breadwinner.
You can always argue with piling assumptions - but it's stealing.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so true.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start feeling guilty of violating copyright
Obviously you don't mind depriving the artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictional income.
Lesson No. 1 should show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have passed from a click.
Perhaps if they share their mp3 walkers with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export this resource that we're talking about, the ralleur who says everything is wrong....
If it is a PS MP who affirms it, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they're old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France draws people down in the assistants continuously.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What brings France down, these are speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business ever since.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies led by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it's rare.
I'm employed because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the null bosses I often meet.
At ease in my basketballs I fully share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he tells the horrible truth!
@gus, if compared with German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to demand reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises - What do French employers expect to do so ??
Let the state hold their hands?
This state that they accuse of impertinence?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-company couple of business leaders on your side!
Remember me, that you created as a job, as a value added, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who is a bountiful and miner while awaiting permanent state assistance!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removing the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, working 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare claim the reduction of wages or their removal!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep up with the flow rather than to change.
This doesn't mean that the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last takes care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do so, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But, well, the Labour will get us bored, isn't it...
She's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral business and taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all that for the decision to be finally canceled.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, the Labour, as they have repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and believes that workers must all lean across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision;)
Maybe it's because Dutch management is on good tracks while British management isn't.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership, but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that being "beating" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, the intelligence, listening to it, for example, the fact that being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beaters", who are no less dead, I know of palancates.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's start over.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you it's AIDE.
Nothing to do with anything worth...!
When it comes to examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
I'll be right back.
Insinuating, it would be only for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves, everywhere, despite will, despite confidence in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
I am sorry to think otherwise, if, having a strong morale will probably make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who's fighting medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts in medicine..
But if we prefer to return to the "lord" it's something else..
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a piece of shit, a real one, you get rid of yourself to the point of becoming a zombie.
Personally I caught two of them, dirt, big ones, and if I got hit like those psychological ends say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of tightening your teeth, suffering from hell, and beating your fists.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
An unforgettable birthday.
His trial was conducted "fast" and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told back then?
The communist became a nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please question what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MOINDRE rule of international law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he were to defend him, he would be overwhelmed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to separate a part of a sovereign State which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was soon recognized by the Western States that then ultimately lied to the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not call Milosevic Tyran (even if we do not love him).
To my knowledge there is only in Greece a method of predicting earthquakes is going about, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
These types of studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for having us share the results.
A hope, therefore, but caution is placed This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus, which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules," according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine, University of Maryland.
The method to be followed.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat.
Thank you, Past of Sciences, for giving us, often, these experimental prowesses that are realized in the world.
How would animals (In advance) know?
No doubt by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the case of earthquakes.
Like radon, for example.
An a priori odorless gas for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments he has.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has often been observed (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and especially to their modification before an earthquake.
So I'm not scientific, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or is it about these research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious review, and no one despises it.
As soon as we speak of the "signs" given by animals, we encounter in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I don't understand how we can think Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help thinking that this man knows nothing about it and that he always tries to have fun with a joke.
He never answers directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name one point.
He made so many promises to get elected as mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just points out how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been taught the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the lead of the party, the Tories popularity rating will collapse the ceiling I am sure.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one
That's exactly what we used to say about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parboarding, smarter than he
In many respects, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as President.
The French have really and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the trouble to read a few books (there are some books, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomons" and the "scarlet of iron" speak, as sadly as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there in the background since the Battle of Savo) did not want to return there.
We actually went to the island of Savo in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission reaches its end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecological side is a total smoke.
Calculate kerozen consumption to achieve the goal completely discredits the concept..
Just go through the list of sponsors than philanthropists.
An operation of com no more nor has it done or done.
The cow, it gives too much desire!!!
I'm looking forward to the webseries!
Your story makes me look back on, identifying me a little bit in the passage (I also learned to sail with the Crocos of L'Elorn at the White Moulin in Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep making us look back, and proudly show the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red hat that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region of Brittany and the City of Brest.
More seriously it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies should not in any way devote a sum of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as sympathetic as those!
Are there players in the current Serbian training that is of Kosovare origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly in Juventus and now in Fenerbahcze, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
He's Bisevac's defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle of the land or before in the 1970s and 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as an attacker in the great Velez team who, under the guardianship of the legendary Suleman Rebach, finished twice in the second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had scores like Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as long as I know he didn't own it.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
It was apparently the flag of the Great Albania, which encompasses all areas where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called the Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give the country ends to neighbouring countries.
How can one feel "an explosion of joy" by seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and without doubt children are inside?
How?
What disturbs me a little in this "witness", is that the only fact of having been able, it would only be once, to spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, testify to me of a "line border" personality whose "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
No doubt at the short moment of "joy", we would not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
It has just been thought, for a moment, that for once Muslims had been able to do real and apocalyptic harm to the great wicked Satan in his very heart.
Making qqch powerful.
That's great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who have been overcome by their feelings of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfraud.
We doubted it a little bit.
The West "Christian/White/Gaulic" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he contemplates the general poverty, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Muslim Arab world.
I'm talking about Cairo or Algiers, not Dubai towers.
The past splendour, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this evil dark world?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigated the Arab world: the bigot conservatism of the powers in place and the fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (mild or armed) of its critical expression.
What we've figured out before, you don't have to get the Muslims back.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Fall is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the breath in the fall.
Not as much to cut off the breath as the summer green when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Great Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We've had a nice summer this year, don't make your squeaky little clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop any more immunity to the germs outside, it can change, I suppose.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of excruciating odors, with a fever that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snowing and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for parties for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the supervision of child increases , it is the amount charged by the State that comes mainly from Decs 8 to 10 .
But in relation to the number of households that have seen their tax rise as a result of this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Figure 2 .
The removal of half of the share of widows in particular is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is fully assessed: 230M of euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and assumes it is painless.
And he's not ready to make it.
Well, we're not on the straw of course, but dreamers.
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we're not going to cry...
It is clear that those of the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let's continue and you'll encourage these 20% unless you work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I still say it.
Live the Trots and OICs recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you look bad at what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from raising as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once money is spent, money is used only to make money, that is to say, to do the greatest harm.
We're one of the richest 20%.
Probably also 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth of which part is logically redistributed).
Fair taxation should allow these households to enjoy some of their efforts.
Or even lower your arms and live on social minimums, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of the head cutters at the red Khmer have happily lived.
I made two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In either one, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face the slightest anxiety.
Just go to someone's house, sleep in it, store up behind yourself and leave.
Then this will be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need a kind of owner insurance.
Make sure to use a service with the logo!
Oh, 6:00 too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You've just really missed a chance.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change locks, made arrangements to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay a bill and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,000 to a site that I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Supporting the troops," sang the Bu$herie over all the tones...
Inoffensive weapons, then.
I am sure it will please families and close to thousands of Kurds killed in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of saddam hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Furthermore, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: IS IT ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly enhanced if "they" were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At this time, our teachers are currently earning more than engineers.
And we don't believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programs.
But this is not seen because the National Education does not have the means to provide an office to the college/lycée to its teachers, so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay the computer, internet connection or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the board at 17h a week and 4 months of vacation we can't complete the math CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to get caught up in some poorly educated clairvoyants whose parents spit on you while treating you as a handkerchief?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarm jihadites so that the people of Khurde can grow better.
Where the Bush administration is seen to have absolutely everything going through.
My first graduate job was in the sale in London to earn three times nothing and yet it was a job for which he needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, don't worry if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well, or you like to do.
If I had stayed in my graduate jobs, I'd still be paying my student loan.
I don't like business so much, so I hope eventually to go either in the public service or in the academic world.
LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year arrears.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of bison lines like art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is, what is called the diplomas of unemployed people.
I've got one of these degrees and I've finished running production.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the above article says, a good career, starting at school and throughout the university.
True, the starting salary was lower, but the levels are rapidly rising because in the real world what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate on engineering studies / artistic lines has been going on for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, to get to work on time and to interact with people in order to achieve results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bison lines?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about the kind of degree you're studying in the media or whatever the unknown course you're going to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are true lines.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Would it not be better for a real territorial policy to disengage Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the end of Essonne and Val-d'Oise make 80km to go back every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
The intra-mural inhabitants and the small belt already have many other more practical means of transport in common (métro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and locked parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by 2RM.
Incidence, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They also benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well we haven't found a place for a single bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not all right.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other common transport users the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that appear are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these bathrooms, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and get away from the survival of bikes 2/ we take full of pollution in the head For me the cyclable lanes are pis go, it is necessary to reduce the motor traffic (urban congestion-type pedestrian), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the road code by verbalizing systematically (even the bicycles to the nearby bemol that you have to adapt the code of the written road for bathrooms 100 years ago to bicycles), generalize the buffer zones after the closed passages, not before the washrooms and scooters don't act.
The cycle tracks are apartheid, but it is necessary to cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the great Paris?
Not a word on the bike's place in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% veiled travel is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think Anne Hidalgo rolled greens into flour.
In addition to learning what OR reports, EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
It's not safe to love the way the world evolves.
It's like horrible air.
My children are not financial assets.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear him say that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, complaints should be filed first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be dismissed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation that would result.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for airspace security, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been killed earlier, Ukraine had launched air raids against the rebels and any aircraft could, of course, be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the light of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents for airlines to pay the overflight rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their usurper government / Western Ukraine's ultranationalists - and who want to show by the way that Putin shot MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their sky.
The precedent: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the CIA's provision of weapons to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not allow this case to go to the ICJ.
It is funny to think that Abbott means Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-supported rebels.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators have said nothing like this.
Calling Ricardo and being such an eco-friendly boy, it's overwhelming!
Calling Polar is losing the north is happy.
One question: is today's poorer poorer than yesterday's poorer?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize the most virulently the Piketty book have not read it!
It's easy to read, I've spent a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of production-income, capital-income, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term..
It shows that the concentration of today's capital is joined by that of the early 20th before 1914, it shows that it was the 2 world wars that brought down the concentration of capital from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this paddle knowing that the concentration capacity of an individual has a few limits.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is fair, we can discuss it without having read the book of which is essentially to argue in a unique sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you spent reading it?
Is the central thesis of his pavilion summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and that is the one that seems to me to be pure fumistry.
The concept of difference between the rich and the poor is subsidiary.
Has humanity not been enriched globally?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and surely deserves the prize.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden on the girl and that she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that the colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes of happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighbourhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her much freedom but mentioned that if she wasn't where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Is Malala itself not part of these "colored perverts"?
You should not have "année time" on this site.
You, yourself, are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, his father wasn't going to marry her when he was 14.
She was 15 when we shot her.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide on her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, inasmuch as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she was saying is that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at the age of 14, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it in a sufficiently eloquent way for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that, if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Rather disappointed by this fourth-season entry and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a little difficulty finding her figure of Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to the perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the Anachronique Life on Mars of Bowie is simply overwhelming.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last one for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all at once to look at 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is about, apart from Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mainly the risks of staging and mounting that made me sit down.
AHS has an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the asepticization of today's productions.
I'm a little away from seeing you throw your sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to measure the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but you say so well, there are many other things.
It's just not that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside of the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series hangs in writing, it wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them do 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end up like 24 hours what.
But everybody does what they want!
It's by what I say "I won't look later" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less tax increases, please - let's cut into government spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to break into spending failed.
Initiation of relatively small expenditure issues, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to call for their wishes and during all this time certain, in each camp, make it seem that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1 per cent of expenditure.
"Debt" is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government's ownership of a third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to use it for good.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the subsidies for almost unnecessary wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you reach a figure that makes the tax of Labour and Lib-Dem quite ridiculous on the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 per year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 pays around £70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vineyard, and it's before VAT.
Almost 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car vineyard.
I'm paying decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend to believe that money falls from heaven, or that it's not important to know where billions of books of taxes are going.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for work at the door prove it?
At the same time, 20% of the unemployed wouldn't look for, which means 80% are looking for and don't find.
Being unemployed myself, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CV, that increases my chances of that.
I haven't had any news from the Employment Pole for months, which means that the officers are more busy with control operations than really getting job announcements back?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not to the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you have to move away from Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, and in this case we ensure that the unemployed perform their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transport title to users of a means of transport, a head of service or employees of their work, etc.
Nobody shouts at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is worth recalling that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the cases, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
Registration and control is currently taking place, while the Employment Pole is legally close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only employees, who pay the costs.
Politicians and French non-wage workers are granted rights they do not actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance is involved in the exploitation of paid labour.
More than waiting for murder tweets in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then look like the spread of black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacement of populations at that time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban this year the Hadj in Mecca from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
The Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted the smallpox to Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent the sick of Ebola from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was simple sense but apparently those who "know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These countries in West Africa where Ebola is out of control should be placed in tight quarantine.
No one's going out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Only last week have people been contaminated after contact with people in West Africa although they have taken "all necessary precautions".
We can stop the advance of this disease.
It is mainly propagated by airlines.
Let us forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be immediately quarantined.
May he pass the message of the first individual and of the group (including religious) and have deserved the Nobel Peace.
I doubt he is capable of erecting the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the functioning planet.
It's still far from that design.
It's only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given premium of humanity, while religion, coming out of the brain, may lead our actions since Lucy.
What is the interest of becoming an integral Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any way put their feet on the Church, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, removing the concept of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sory the church does not have a limited view of France.
And in the world, it can be that it will affect more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envision it pre-existing to the Christ.
Hillel a century before said to him: "Don't do to others what you don't want to be done, that's all the Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond a mere reciprocity but introduces a·gaʹpe.
Your "progressing justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has upset moral laws by redefines the respect of others.
Christians will then be prepared to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and driven to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not inventing.
I would personally choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The joys of the computer department block all nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% reduction, or does £30 include 20% reduction?
Note though: the PC version is only for DX11.
It caught me by surprise, I bought it, but you can't play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's nothing.
It's time to buy a new video card
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll erase it from your library if they decide to sever against the people who buy it there while they're out of the area.

So, was France in 1940 a "spoilt land"?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Should we love France's 40th, that of "the strange defeat"?
When we see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, we wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano who is already hard to read in French and who describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso only have a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will be able to appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, keep going to Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hail to the terrible.
Since I've been driving one in Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sportage anywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello, Dantra. Still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days' rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cider party.
It was bordélic.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were only fans of CAMRA (not to be confused with the fanatics of the camera).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
On Monday night we went to a buddy's grandfather's house to play the baby card brag.
Thanks to a real chance to beginner I was able to leave with several decent tips.
I hope if I get to 95 years old I'll be as good as him.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of bark on it.
I admire M.
Read some Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you're a little far from the subject.
This famous whole, she prohibits searches for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
She's reporting weapons trafficking.
We either have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It's not keeping our eyes closed that we get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you do a monumental counter-sense: all representative, Muslim or non-Muslim authorities, organizations or associations, having formally condemned the IS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or non-Muslims, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Anyone who doesn't say a word consents.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the Jewish French's approval of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they publicly manifest themselves to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt.
This principle is in my view the refusal of the Republic and can only contribute to the delicacy of French society.
If there is no doubt, so do I.
Who doesn't say a word consent, but consent to what?
It consents to a close relationship with IE or to the condemnation of IE.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house goats and goats.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, during the elections, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has been drawn between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified with the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are those threats?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland since there are no seats.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the losing Labour seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to pour a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads to the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking that he was saving his party but without realizing that he was signing the death arrest of his Scottish deputies.
It is not surprising that some Labour MPs are calling on their leaders to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Sealing 8 per cent pumps at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish Members are no longer able to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists, and she did it.
However, he is still in high school to be prime minister in 2015 and since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, mostly, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is the "Life of the Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon manufactures YOUR book according to YOUR profile and it automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
He's gay like the world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I still read stolen files, public domain books or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without mochard.
Given the price I paid Kobo, it's no regrets.
I am afraid of the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
In your general public bookstore, you will notice systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably ridiculous.
For example, “Finnegans Wake” by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Big Data era, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put the whole literature in the same bag.
The anonymous data collection when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is so, not allowing or identifying readers, nor authors.
But Kobo has all this information, him.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government over the past few days that the country seems to be headed by a class of motherhood full of schizophrenic children under acid.
It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some Erdogan supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot a bullet in the foot unless you win something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it is actually to shoot a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent here a serious warning of reprisals or whether it merely advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what is truly surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
Indian Punchline's reading is strongly recommended to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the c*nneries balanced by traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read keeping in mind the realistic observations / previous warnings from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who seriously combat the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipelines policy pushes the world into the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to "moderate" who do not exist to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than that if you take Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account" Is there any other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial was needed for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it "necessary"?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have the least chance of being alive?
A little late for that, man.
Wouldn't the criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, huh?
Especially concerning the Triumvirate of the CUP that planned and directed genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a crowded place of Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire.
What a delight!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real one.
What clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that even beats in the womb of a mother bear.
Lesbian couples may simply be a desire for children and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterilized hetero couples as well.
As for the children!
How shameful to call them psychologically unbalanced futures.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay for the retirement of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It doesn't date today.
Many women have brought and put into the world children who were not their husbands.
It's still like this, so we're done...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't the same body marketing?!
Anakronik Fareinheit...
Of course it is more elegant to make a good in faraway countries via the internet and Pay Pal than to shoulder his responsibilities and avoid the scandal in another century near home without yelling it at this time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done on behalf of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands, I saw this only a few miles away.
I had to go there the day because I didn't have the right to go there at night!
But if you like that and you listen to music - this music today always touches you as much.
I don't know why there are so many disparaging comments here about what Paul Mason says, perhaps they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football that awaits your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of North England's culture.
No wonder that Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context, he understands things very well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vamped by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can have an ear if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15th at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I thought, too, "always the same story," but this is a little article that was well written and well thought out.
Your criticisms really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped from Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan de Victoria/Exchange and get off to Wallgate.
They're dripping pills.
What the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 min walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of George Gently's Gently Northern Soul Police Series, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business gets more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace since he wants to continue to occupy-colonization (in fact, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative stood up in anger and roared: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not even here at the time!"
The representative of Palestine (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its people have no confidence in the bipolar government of Palestinian authority and will not lower custody ...
That this displaces anti-Israeli is obvious, it is not the aim sought ...
Anti-Zionist : But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it has always been this way since the Policy is globalized ...
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-Colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain that it remains!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What force relationship allowed Israel to be created?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
Do you doubt that ?!! ...
Besides, it's not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian's journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyist billevises written by none other.
That proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a suite of personal attacks and innuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes her, which means it's a matter of immaturity).
A truly vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand tells certain truths, perhaps the truths we prefer not to think about.
Hold on, that feeling's going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand is horrifying some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a populist beginner, but all this not voting story has been completely misinterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather cross their arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and restricting democratic commitment to this is completely unnecessary, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) governing essentially for particular interests, multinational companies and rich ones, At no time does he say simply ignore politics because these parties do not rule on our name: he insists that rather than just vote and disconnect for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, no matter and try to influence politics from this.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active by presenting his requests can go hand in hand with the fact of voting, since politicians are girouettes that will change their opinion if they really risk losing the elections), but it's aghast to see all these condescending answers that this idiot who makes Jesus tell young people not to take the trouble of voting and just hoping that everything will be better because it's really distorting his arguments.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were to discuss what it really says rather than simply label it irresponsible and put aside the concerns of it and a large number of people left on its own.
Yes, thank you.
The matter on the vote was completely distorted.
The need to slip a ballot in a ballot box every 5 years makes me very angry because my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members of Parliament who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's statements are not his own (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own thoughts and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and university students from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "sub-chomskyist billevesées".
I am quite convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head hoceries added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russel but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him into his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "funge" reveals, above all, to me that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDVs of history where trade historians have become minority and where exchanges of specialists have been impoverished for the benefit of pre-condemned type Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take on a culprit, an emissary goat.
They develop both of the very rational reasonings, but this rationality is based on these emissary goats that are the key to the vault of their thoughts.
I believe rather that for Foucault the state was indispensable as guilty.
This is part of a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship with each other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist slope, neo-lib and / or /liberary (in both terms the second marks a tightening of the desire for eradication of the state, the first knowing to go to seek the State's help for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
His thinking is built on the guilt of the State: without this guilt he does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals quoted here.
No other support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of its god of time, Stalin, the small father of peoples.
Oulala, you may have read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apologization of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he's an original and respectable thinker.
See this cabal orchestrated by human sciences researchers on the left who don't support the passing of allegiance to their mantras, is quite ridiculous.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is unlimited.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebellies", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our friends from Australia on that subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think so about the Whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them holding violently anti-Blanc statements.
My father's not happy that his eldest daughter is out with a white guy.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spreads out of big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
I was told that the Russians are mainly prejudiced against temporary workers with no qualifications originating in the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the river Ienissei, Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians' opinions about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, when I met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), didn't keep bad memories, all the people were brave and, in fact, those in London were very nice is the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember whom we meet, all people are brave, how they remember who it was.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Blanches would assault them PHYSICALly.
No measure on the impartiality of justice.
Yet she is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the judicial community is frankly branded right.
When he is at the union of the judiciary, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of bias can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
The observer's political vision as well as the judge's factual interpretation.
Then there remains the required tool of the law to focus the evaluation on fundamentals.
The measure of non-compliance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecution, forces a distinction between the error and the bias of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that acts of justice do not split between these three groups.
The claim and lack of knowledge is not subject to objective analysis.
So if this isn't analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only through statistics revealing implicitly that it is going to be very low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The one from corruption* from the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The area concerned is that of the removal* of heirs committed to the procedure* by successor genealogists commissioned by notaries.
This profession obtains EUR 150 million in good year while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is combined with the so-called statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogist and heirs who are reluctant to become unsolicited, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria not an elaborate form of lie?
Totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to strangle the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these ground tricycles, built to measure its size and weight and it really allowed him to take advantage of the open air as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and brittle tires, could not.
Like we say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like EPIC.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog's crust on a kennel.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all land, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard pendant.
Here are hills that they would like.
Prices look really high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so "you see."
The tricycle all terrain seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, however.
Many of them have insurance at their disposal of a reasonable amount.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can allow themselves to practice high prices for things that they know properly that they are necessary for us.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not expected to make it.
I'M SUPPORTING that the long distance wheelchair does not arrive on the market, because there's apparently no way to drive this thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockades!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation as well, since this blockade inflicts a “collective penalty” on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement into the black market " ...
Ah, it's not the wood tongue, rather in concrete and armed the lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, unacceptable for anyone with a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-kept land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Don't forget that when you lifted it, Morsi restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built against the people who have chosen their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the economy of sharing, not for profit.
Many are looking for only one night's blow on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hope) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this?
"What does it rent on"?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The word "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, if you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have good insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% consistent with all the safety rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers to do a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse).I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that ships can be displaced, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The pennies are so slow that if anyone tried to steal her she would always be near where you left her.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our pennies...
Where are you going to moor him?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one who exposes the facts!
Poverty increases in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth between the wealthiest hands is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to collapse!
High finance, speculation, therefore, plays with our companies our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food, our food, therefore our health care structures, with our debts therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold..
All of this for any hyper-mega-obsessed money.
To the contrary, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was 2012.
In 2014, he appointed an elder from the Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of bankers, solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else competing?
What do you call it, return her jacket, lower her pants?
Primary and populist response
Actually, we don't know much about what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee really "refused" to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British leather in the area.
The sea was ugly at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Likewise, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the photos showing the survivors while being dried, you see a calm sea and in the middle of the day.
Moreover, rescuers knew that at this stage there were no more German fighters in the area.
Hmm, that doesn't really fit what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick research on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two cured cruisers, who had disappeared in the black after stopping the shooting, and a race-purchase began.
Leipzig saw something in the fire, but when he got closer, he saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives the Monmouth, painted and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his spotlights on the ship's flag, the proposal to go was refused and he opened the fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee found that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 22.15 p.m.
Concerned about reports indicating a British leather in the vicinity, he went north.”
So, if this is true, the Germans, in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had flowed, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important leather of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in the confusion they deguerined to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should take a path through many Royal Navy ships.
The sacrifice of Cradock had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
A number of votes were put to the PUM to request that it be included in the law that a finally sentenced election be therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch left-wing electors well on.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSAL FOR INCRITION WITH THE COUNCILS OF MAGISTERS
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated between citizens?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to soften those who will benefit from their immutability to hinder the actions of real policies, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is adequate.
I met them in the subway about noon with their small banners "of bass for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if right-wing unions, or even extreme-right trade unions, designated for the target of its members and led to a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are totally free.
If, at the moment, the right wing defrays the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that are relevant to it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality that has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have paid attention to it have not had any favor treatment.
On the other hand, it should be remembered that the left-wing judiciary union is not the only union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
Let a minister support trade unions with so much commitment show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you are quoting may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at Chancellery, it's not a secret.
We are now wondering whether the "mission" of certain judges is not more coming out than instructing.
@gus - You should be satisfied, SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that magistrates are not civil servants like others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Wassel.
I believe that even the weakest hungry of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of disks or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is in fact one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed with the Eurovision, as well as so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and the rest participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most light entertainment stars on British television.
Of course, some have fallen into the background.
But this is what happens anyway to most stars who do not participate in the competitions.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in making others.
Anyway, most singers/groups can at best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, whatever his name is, has just fans in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical way of rock, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar-smokers who smoke grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a poem primary school will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even go out an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns rather quickly to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present us these people as infinitely superstitious and stones of ritual whisky, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, from practical considerations to everyday life.
Unless you interpret unwisely in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our way is as reminded of seeing the sacred as a sort of object well defined and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article whatever it is.
It's the ephemeral deco to furnish the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred life always lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would lead to the horticultural interpretations not at all scientific that last a mandarin's life, rarely less.
When does a comparative criticism of disciplines make us laugh a little bit?
Because what is true for archaeology is also true for interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is totally unjustified!
It is thanks to them that you constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could deceive themselves.
Today we have such powerful technical and scientific means that the interpreting of searches is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
We are here in the middle (and old) controversy over the shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf. his book "Las lamanas de la prehistoire", particularly the increased re-editation of the scientific controversy, published by La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this highly instructive article
Hetero men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could go.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we go on to three?
This paper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canyon?
No, but we're not against a play up there.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy up there, on the other hand, it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost finished, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, brave, so that they write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and risks.
Rather than sneezing with these dirty ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go on, then.
If these "poor ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this paper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is fully possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at you?
However, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video crash on the net...???
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots it would have removed the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g. decapainator) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that was known to arrive, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (television, pub, money...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I also share that opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM gets the SC in, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the rest of the chance to beat the English that led then...
You are leaving this blog my dear Dayrton.
But it's not bad, I have a little time to dump all your c********ries.
No, just not.
There were lots of plots in F1, but never one that puts Commissioners in danger of death for a distant history of a pilot's chance of victory at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out safe because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In view of amateur images, the lack of image allows the AIF to avoid such awkward questions: How does the Commissioner shake a full-blown green flag and continue to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it's not because the video is considered too violent that the AIF blocks the images of the accident but because one of the Commissioners clearly sees a hit green flag, signs that the race can resume normally and that we are more under yellow flag.
Some comments show a dark ignorance of the F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, from which the green flag shakes.
It's the usual procedure.
The post of Comrades just downstream of the accident (as the case may be, 10 meters as well as 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to take back a normal look.
The sensationalism sells pubs.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that ultimately it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, fear of not having sexual life, pub and media are good for selling things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
The info does exactly the same thing.
Making buzz with information we really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so we can keep controlling them.
"When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear" This should be "derailing," not "sighing."
Given the medical reference, "touching" is much better said in this context than "derailing".
I wonder if all the people who are struggling that Ebola could spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that mocks beautifully and firmly this pseudo-journalism abject.
It made me laugh.
I'm sorry that the media are talking about most of the things with this reverse optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without going into hysteria) so that the government can make us derail when it needs it.
I believe that it is perfectly logical that if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven cases?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises it has invented itself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of being ruled by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be from this world almost 35 years later.
Besides at the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of passing it for years .....
Testimony perfectly useless.
As always when we're talking about science.
Not only do the testimonies serve nothing: taken alone, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot serve as scientific material.
This may be why we refrain from asking psychiatric questions when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) does not serve anything in a scientific approach?
On what basis are you researching, then?
On ghosts?
Are you putting the same level of fantasistic theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the word biden adulated by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take for great psychologists after reading D'ensembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of meaningless buzzwords in the psys.
Cyrulnik hit us with the "resilience".
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have framed a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
So why?
It was a great series and it looks like those who show it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the powerful who can perform miracles.
But how are they gonna get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the humor of the genus pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
UKIP works for Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Always in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if you don't see the children and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although I'm an adult), but I hope it will give the idea of a channel to recast the old ones.
The series almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we have episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 6:00 p.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can always see it at these times.
And in addition the half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old "sad" guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mountain of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades !!!
Radical Zionists have invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all Israeli excavations below and around the Esplanade mosque for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists is elsewhere.
Can it be in Argentine??
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the sprawling of mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, is in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad went up to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham nearly sacrificed his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and unfortunately they are related to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan to 2 states, and has continually tasted it!).
It is also good to show how peaceful the annexation of Jerusalem is.
Will God be able to recognize his own?
The shortest Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
In order to boast of tourism in Israel, we are often shown young girls who are half-wintered, English on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as we can see from the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary though.
And this picture is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
It is unfortunate that the photographer of Reuters did not take the photographs of the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to enter the Mount of the Temple and who prefer to cascade the Jewish faithful in contrabas, praying to the Wall for lamentation.
@Mat, If this picture bothers you, it's right, it's neither the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that it must be condemned.
This system is not tenable and will end up crying.
The only way to put an end to this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to have gone wild, large businesses have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given increasingly important remuneration to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of laughing and moaning when someone else is making the strike, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that we don't mess with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
All of this can't end well.
It's because we're in democracy that it took.
Have you voted for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Partnership for Trade and Investment (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people in short-circuiting national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that is exactly what the mechanism for settling disputes between investors and states (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and try to alert people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
This is what makes excellent results, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman was right, at 18th there were unions in all regiments
In the very Catholic French armed, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave there (finally, his officers, the others, no one knows anything) to believe the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, briefly: the dissolution of the idea of the Nation, having this little relic, it is comforting.
Even though for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
They still miss the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know anything yet
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm syndicating myself.
You've been warned, it's your fault.
In order to defend the interests of the categories, there are already enough protected professions with trade unions, which has created a break-up of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of the risk on the part of an employee.
We can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
No disaster assured.
And with the carts that prepare, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here commented...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and business management."
This is absolutely essential with the disruption of the information power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review".?????
Wait, the section was here, all empty.
I thought we needed to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I've been watching, and I can tell you that some of them have been well-seasoned.
In Joffrey's wedding episode we have one of the best moments (who is misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in line that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; no one has made the "boom, here my fucking cake now eat it and bow before your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure of friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears last week.
I like cooking, but I can't imagine I'm doing this.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us a super entertainment and motivate us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015 !
I agree, the last challenge of last year, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually spend days doing them and they had to brick one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to break down, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
In Luis, the only real fault they could have found was the rather dry base (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice-cream on Richard's mill didn't give any desire, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time spent.
There is also cancer that looks, with solar wind blows.
It's decided that everything is going to work for us right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is primarily blocked by the ozone layer that is precisely formed by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field were weakening, there would not be enough solar wind to "extend" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), heat us (less than infrared), modulate our immune system and, apparently, improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVC and lets the UVA and most UVB pass.
Do you know that you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a remaining when you post a comment?
Especially for minor precision which was implied in the comment, which he himself intends to demonstrate teaching.
Without saying that I'm a melanoma habit, UV makes it only ACCELATE its development.
They don't provoke him.
For evidence: not all bronzed persons do not necessarily have melanomas.
Either, when a tubib tells you that you must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a basement, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for all humans.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we bend it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
Or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied and the strength of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use it is intended for.
I think the army would need something more resistant and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a front-line communication material.
But for us others,
There's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We joke about this in every debate.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke on the fold that I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before specific software is installed, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we see bad how it could get back there.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......................................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and which is therefore matched with the installed factory test code.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
Photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or EC logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
ah l article for bobo par par excellence.
We want cheap products and we're surprised that industrialists produce in » industrials' We're putting forward super u but all the brands and even the small business are concerned How to cook good, bio avac 1650€ (medium salary in French)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his priorities where he hears it.
For me, feeding is one.
Go without resentment, I kiss you.
It's called bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It's the total thought-reason breakdown.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferia, joining the left-caviar, of which they are sometimes drawn, for example by condemning CO2 releases while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuferia, too, are not surprised to meet frequently criticisms about them.
Waoh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theorization as well as for all related details (aircraft, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the greens at any moment.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the ecosystems because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front of him.
She's so badly done that she looks vaguely like a naked woman.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth of this work.
But you just don't have any legitimacy to comment because you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really managed to become fabulously rich and famous with no artistic abilities.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That's not really a fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are real dog reproductions that smoke by playing billiards.
Judging art may be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than simply representing the real.
If you're looking for this, a camera will do the business.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to save: riding activities, the number of Republican guards horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
L(honesty obliges France to say that France decreases its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more dramatically, to begin with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operator without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at the time when we observe the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow to the local communities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or even some of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
@edmond: that's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to make savings but especially not at home, at my house it's really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, to look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
May all those who have sided little or enough the military thing dare to say here, the eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
The same potion will be applied to the public service as a whole and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why Defense can be a bit charged!
Well, yes, the savings that everybody agrees on saying they should do, must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at murder when it happens to them, the poor dear ones.
It would have to be done, but above all, it won't fall on me because, in this case, it's a crime, not an economy.
Guignols, come on!
How will closing the Grace Valley weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history is repeated at each closure of post, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is, of course, for savings.
It's weird, a mayor UMP who wants compensation and doesn't appreciate the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is depressing to have her Facebook thread parade and to see that 80% of her friends started their statutes with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie.
He will surely rely on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus by going to work and realize only where his skirt has returned to his pants.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely bullshit.
Not really, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of his return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
No computers.
God, I need to watch this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just demonstrated that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that satirical journalism is!
I'm falling apart!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have enlightenment and discover the incredible brightness and insurmountable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they are neither women nor transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and association initiatives.
Until new order we are confiscating the right to save our planet by states that play truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things into our hands.
With the Commissioner they have grown to energy, all these beautiful recommendations have flown ....
Translate: Eoliennes and solar farms are the round points of tomorrow.
All financed by the taxable person.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully mastered, it is better to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided of course it drastically reduces our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France has nothing to do with it.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other stages.
Electricity from wind renewables or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and above all gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittentness.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PV would run counter to CO2.
Christial I don't insult you I'm a State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 plus I've done nuclear physics research I challenge you to prove otherwise what I said.
As far as I didn't say it is you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany anything in fact you didn't answer what I was saying and like all the people on the right to demolish the interviewer I never do.
I also mention the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a non-profit and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the water vapour of greenhouse gas of less effect than the Co2 it is true to remember the two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear plant starts in water vapor and a little in river water.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "South Asian giant" ...!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindus.
I'm not surprised, most Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your mind.
It would have been the same if they had qualified India as a giant in South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a pandore box full of corruption and mafia.
As for the ISL, today's opening game has been surprisingly interesting, Kolkata's Athletic is imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
Compared to the billions and billions spent in India on the Cricket of the IPL and now on football, how could we ever compete with our "noisy neighbors"...
The low cost runner race pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible lack of design only occurs with too cold helium.
So maybe we're not in a design defect, but implementation...
unlike the arianspace that is a private company, it seems it belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as the state here is its own insurer..
They may be going to pay for satellites in frigates that know..
This is all the more annoying than many media loops the only titles of articles - and many readers only retain these titles.
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
All agreed with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly questions the project while it is only a launch problem.
