What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected members at the capital city hall are apparently going to have to overcome a real language barrier to understand at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The newspaper Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argument that was born in recent years in the mayorate, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were leading in Prague.
The vocabulary coded by Prague's political cream started in the previous era of Mayor Pavel Well describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the new voters did not understand the well-known terms.
At least they say so.
Who's Valdemort?
"I really don't know."
"I am a young man in pragois politics has responded to Lukas Kaucky, the culture-chosen one to test the vocabulary of the "poor".
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golfhole".
"It's the only expression you propose I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the arght.
Of the vocabulary, including the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year prior to the pre-Cectoral Congress of the ODS, the writing chose six examples, primarily those related to the mayorate of Prague.
Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", going to the pastry, "boeuf nerf", "traison of the capital" and "entulling".
Three of the elected members agreed for the quiz, the Fourth Antonin Weinert, who has to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then didn't pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek refused the test.
"I don't care about all these things here and how the representatives of the citizen democracy are amused: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand ourselves in our programs," he responded.
As previously heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not seem to recognize in the above legend, that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he came up with in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky said and immediately added, "but I know about newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," joked he.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who is actually Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "go to the bakery".
"It's about, I think, going into a business," Plachy is ready to guess that it's about the headquarters of the companies in Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he learns about newspapers rather than some vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no lexicon of arght in social democracy.
"I've been consulting with colleagues and it seems that we don't really have anything like this."
"In fact, names are sometimes used as abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socio-Democrat Party, whom the members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called to Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me like that," Karel Brezina said about nicknames.
Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for Party members or the least friendly old, Miroslav Pouche representative, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scams during the party's sponsorship, is referred to as "the little joujou".
Nicknames are also the only ones that admit to employing social democrats within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this pragmatic president.
"Doctor in matraque law" recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title as a doctor in law JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "surgeons", it has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the old generation, they cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "sister" is isolated to avoid threatening the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has this destiny."
"We don't judge young women in good health either because they participate in work and give birth to children," said a sister who works in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of over 100 women who were rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
The case has a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said the daily Die Standard about the inconvenience of written education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Amy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil they had sprinkled on her.
It was the BBC server who sent this information.
Criminals claim it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used in ritual anointings has ignited to the woman's contact.
The oil ignited, it seemed, when the team wanted to "throw out the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "serceres" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human-spirited eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the hunting of witches, the Gambia is not later than the President himself saw last year.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunt for witches who, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have struggled by the black magic to kill the President as well."
"Guinean shamans coming to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and personal custody of the President, men and women randomly selected in the villages of Gambia," the organization "Amnesty International said in a message.
On the farm, imprisoned persons were to drink a plant potion based on hallucinogenic effects, in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
About a thousand people were released on international pressure.
Bakal's tenant: The heated polies, he signed a higher rent.
An old imposing man came out of the door of the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3,500 the son will have to settle from next year for a second category 2+1 apartment 4100 kroner.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel," shows the finger on his son's new contract the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed it anyway," he explained in anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of the apartments BytyOKD.cz who described the new terms of rental as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to it by a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by twisting his eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has for this reason decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, " rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
One pressure and one paper with a number coming out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts to light up on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short time, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance and other events.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio cover mails with new lease contracts in their letter boxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for new rentals has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for about a week, so it's still testing," she answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the client appears as a journalist.
The deregulation and former Bakal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and originating in the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region of the social democrats has reported it in a rather sustained manner before the elections and it now completes the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a putt...n board in the toilets, relief in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mainly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a refund on the new price of rent if they sign now as the RPG promised in a special offer.
This is a reversal of half the amount of rent that will be received by other tenants who will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent it," the employee says at the window.
And yet RPG places both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on rent, the decision will be taken by an independent court.
'These are not threats but only information about the unique and legitimate way of acting legally', says RPG on its website.
"Here no one will go to court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man on the street in front of the client centre is right.
"I have 13,000 retired crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she says.
The settlement of rents ends in the Czech Republic with early 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And today's rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of RPG Byty's residential portfolio, which is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in 4 billion apartments, in four years of 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen attached to the ceiling in front of the crowded chairs of the Havirosvka Street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and affects no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments'.
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per month," says the screen.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns to m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase of rents (see graph) is returned to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on higher rent have priority.
Maternal school is also part of offices that have included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also accommodate a mini school motherhood with all the necessary - colour walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of the employees of Arch. design can go there.
The architectonic project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has envisioned his mini-maternal business school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially from the age of children, and it was important that women architects and project leaders could quickly return to work.
At the same time as low-time employment contracts, the maternal school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this mother school and with the support of management that they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-maternal school is funded through the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
They were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years to provide qualified personnel and the start-up.
After the use of the funding allocation (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini-maternal school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted for one year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to apply for staffing.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a nursery teacher take care of children. Children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are more than three years old for most.
As it is a "mini school motherhood" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more to replace.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is individual care and education, the maternal mini-school program is similar to that for preschool education.
Children do not just play it but they are also guaranteed quality education - from the beginning to the preparation of schools they teach English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and do not have the stress of a delay to go looking for children in a school away from the parent's place of work.
Parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer is created.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Look into Gaudi's interiors.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric sarian, the staircase with a dinosaur spine and the balconies with open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received the nickname of House in bone from the premises.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, façade recalling scales and all over present curves, here is all that is ypic for the New Art by Anthony Gaudius.
The front façade of the house runs its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In a more detailed observation we see geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
Rolling and twisting of shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eye and the blades.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district on Passeig de Gracia market street at number. 43, was born of the construction of an 1877 house by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of old construction and the construction of another new one, but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of unusual reconstruction and better market.
But Casa Battlo's idea as a house with multiple dwellings was not thought of alone by Gaudi.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its project that decorations were born for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
Other artists and creators have also worked for the facade.
The joint work on the plans of Casa Battlo began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises nicknamed the house hot just after it was finished because of its organic forms "the House in the Bone".
Others, in view of the specific window opening mechanism, called it the "house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of construction sculpture contain hidden religious grounds.
Gaudi has thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with air events and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the Gaudi creation, it was absolutely not in line with the construction directives and it was not allowed to be blocked by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained the building permit from the city, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and demanded changes.
For example, he did not like the members of the municipal council that construction pillars are impeding on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal of Josep Battlo asked (and got satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common lounge and in the third there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented with jewelry.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you can access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also works on the modern concept of space linkage.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the hall doors and high society can communicate comfortably or limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two floors in addition.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the interior courtyard is decorated and with light wells.
The two-color game gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the dark that instead absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and they expanded the field of visits to the common spaces and the barn, including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a friend among the residents of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a summary: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for sleeping, so the mattress and the summit give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During choice several things are decisive: weight, size, age, state of health and the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which you will place the mattress and the top is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where latex mattresses are not continuously asleep are not appropriate because they "heat up" slowly.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. The mould can also form.
The habit is also decisive in choice.
One who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a softening layer will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all hockeyists who come back from NHL complain they can't sleep there."
"For their weary shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a lattice layer of lazy mousse."
"These mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore take ill "information" from joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in stuffed furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with a lazy mousse conquered hockeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses for example.
You don't need to be a NHL guy in order to enjoy a lazy mousse.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't come back in the night like after a tough match.
You're just sleeping better.
The lazy mousse also works as a protection against the squares.
For the choice of mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, approximately 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm in full 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of the Bourreliers-Matelassiers and decorators who have spent many years on the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaching in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs his own top and mattresses, so pay attention however during the basket to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only be able to climb the top at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the layer of shape and aeration at least three centimeters.
"To touch or sit on the mattress you should not feel the springs," says Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of addition.
The bed summary, when the mattress and the summary are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; we must not wash it, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to remember a large (and closed) tamis.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make a 25-year life claim for a mattress or life assurance.
But it's all his own.
And for this, an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make coatings with sliding closure for the whole, that is, after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when you remove them a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have in your bed a rigid plank instead of a floor?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there is no) with air holes and use spring mattresses with a minimum height of 15cm with spring spring springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of air.
A polyurethane mattress must not be part of such a bed.
For single-position laminate summaries with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconuts) are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are folded in the bottom of the kidneys and so it is possible to regulate its rigidity.
For mattresses with multiple positions it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
In addition to the rigidity adjustment of the blades you can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special link of the blades that allows pressure or even tilt the blade to make the sleeping shoulder "integrate" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", it's really important.
This is already considered by the mattress manufacturers who for the "male" began to use a rambling area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips level.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or platelet summaries with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and diinuates the tension.
But of course, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and soak, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the ear must support the head and its ends must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the earring should level up (with the shoulder cradle of the top or the area that crumbles in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something common with the first straw and grass base.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"The Bio Qualification for Matellas means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While extracting from bubble plants so that the mattress coating absorbs the heat and cools the body, "cool" the man, the coatings "heating" the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
The current favorites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with thus disrupted cell structure than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of the cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for mattress and summary is not easy.
From time to time, there may be in special actions by manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
Like the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam Memory sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempor material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This started as a material for NASA because astronauts had to start huge load factors.
The Tempor shrinks in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes it optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against sleeplessness and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve legs and vein system.
Czech manufacturers use e.g. EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
The devices to monitor people are increasingly being requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear of their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases as illustrated by that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has stirred up a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even though the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We strive to tell everyone that this is not espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know the purpose of using the box and how to use it in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to carry something like this on him, he will get rid of it.
'And even the youngest can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don't want to be under control.'
"The mobile phones, which can be cut off like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very questionable.
"If it's a pre-arranged rapture, the author will do everything to ensure that the child has no electronic device that can locate him."
"Now it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
It also confesses that such devices can help in an attack not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, he claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is on a regular basis after a specified period of time."
"In case the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is in an extended position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, smartphone phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after being trained with a special software.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to the ones that are worn in the pendant of the size of a box of lighters or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Macro Weil's Pilina, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracer."
"Or he'll figure it out after a while, which gave the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used as self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating strings that it could tour the Czech Republic with, but it can only hold for two years.
The army bought for 445 km of strings used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the strings is not more than two to four years.
The army bought detonating strings at the anonymous STV Group company for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for a huge amount of MF DNES detonating strings that soldiers use 60 km a year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnicians, MF DNES has contacted, it follows that even the generals, officers with a command, secretary or household personnel should have an annual exercise in explosives.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vladimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of 60 km of detonating strings by the army.
At this distance there are 25,000 explosions.
And even if that was true, the military reserves could sustain it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient to provide more than 2 m of detonating strings, as the experts say, that the army with its new purchase has also ensured - with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the mentioned 225 years.
However, the troops of the rapid intervention squad recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their fist weapons and that the shooting sessions were limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body linen we don't talk about.
"And I don't take my head off if they buy us such a lot of detonating strings."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good customer that we strive to be content merchants," says STV Group Jan Decky's business director.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating strings will be ordered by the army to have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reported only four years of life of detonating strings and police and military pyrotechnics only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in deposits, it can even go up to four years," said one who does not want his name published in the light of the army's criticism.
The length of time passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a discount due to the amount for 445 km of detonating strings.
"They cost us 60 per cent less than last year's delivery of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek, who is the interpreter of the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating strings of police pyrotechnics that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always command only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for reasons of safety of pyrotechnicians and in addition to being able to obtain more flexible types of more modern and more reliable detonating strings.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems in neutralizing tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army was preparing to move, heading towards the Rhine.
What this Czech army has been waiting for in a few years is that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of miles of old detonating strings that it buys today "at a cheap price".
So far I benefit from contacts that I have obtained through the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition of the best individual entrepreneur for last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments to half-demolition.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region gave me a desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
It reinvests the profit in the building it converts into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open 4 guesthouses in Liberia, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars Pytloun hotel design.
This year he had another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other Pytloun hotels franchise candidates showed up", number 1 of previous entrepreneurs.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel victory in the contest of the contractor of the year has served well," added Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known to Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he uses his contacts and knowledge to date that he could not have gotten otherwise.
"With those I met thanks to the competition I started to maintain business relationships regularly.
According to him, the reputation for success also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I observe in them especially the loyalty and pride of engaging in something that has generally been recognized."
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of good work for all of us.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has been repetitive replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the goal of winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to find the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place in the competition for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it turned a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million kroner.
'I can say that the reward has not only encouraged my employees and increased our self-confidence to fight competition," said the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the communists, he did not hesitate long ago, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in his father's surroundings for the manufacture of plastic bathers.
Not long after they started specializing in vegetable oil presses.
He became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe after eighteen years.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after successful competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers begin to really know the Farmet brand but also foreign partners who began to realize that they were working with a society that has achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not go to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the 2008 and 2009 economic results.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have of course not escaped this situation."
"Business figures fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even fire," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained beneficial results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We built a training and research centre with the endowments, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky said.
We all believe that the crisis is behind them.
The number of affidavits increases with them the number of employees as well.
"To the new winner I want this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that eliminates foolish regulations.
The survey on the absurdity of the year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
The little glorious winner of this year's Absurdity Survey of the Year was the obligation to bring to the offices the documents that staff can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor could obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the Trade Register for Insurance Payment Controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesman of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must complete in the Czech Republic and remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this year's absurdity competition.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters showed up, at least 4000 voted this year.
And it's not surprising, in our country there are the most diverse legal obligations that only keep the company from working, and, more and more.
"Perhaps we are in the number of documents to be completed for tax returns at the top of the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneur activity becomes a widespread goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74th place in terms of the company's conditions, i.e. 8 more places than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first established in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone who can report each year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April at the end of September, last time before the end of the competition.
To report on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the competition organizer selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and lets the public vote during October on www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the largest number of votes is declared victorious.
Until last year's survey, it was about one hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs, but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, there is an obligation among the nominees, for example, to pay tolls for motorway and fast track maintenance vehicles, or even for contractors with twenty employees, to repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always starts in early November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of a meeting that regularly participates in political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts beats in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this reason my goal is to delete at least three dozen paragraphs every year that today only complicate the company," said Martin Kocorek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd crests is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what did not please people was the obligation of contractors to report three days before the office for the individual company where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most plebiscite obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was deleted with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is okay until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sport projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has existed for 5 years, is the category called the 2010 Firm Responsible.
The only objective of this competition is to support the fair and reasonable enterprise.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their company on the environment and carry out socially responsible activities," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the Vodaphone firm, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the firm's 2010 competition, organized by Vodaphone, companies that do not have any success with a single long-term goal for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the object of their business is different from one another, their support and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns the persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic is no example of the company of pragois and Netera software that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor for 17 years to the endowment fund sponsoring children with disabilities.
With regard to employees with health problems, the old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant which employs more than 70 per cent has been awarded the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohemian Region and which has moved third in the region to the firm of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for having introduced flexible working hours and even reduced up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, reducing wages.
The jury also awarded the title because it gives priority to Czech manufacturers, supports a dittoyen activity in the close environment and is concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment," says Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of society.
the company responsible IT Logit de l'Region de Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has established for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The Man in the Shadow that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of the society.
At the latest level, for its activities, there is also a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonus over standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, increased qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Czasch construction company, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the corporate category Responsible, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year of Competition, who had responded to the accompanying questionnaires of the registration document and sent it to the organizer before 15 August.
The incomplete or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in high school had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the company Responsible but were not disqualified from the competition "principal" the Signature of Vodaphone Year."
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Signature of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison&Rose Organizing Agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local contractor and trading in real estate Lubos. G.
The latter had endeavoured to handle correctly a call for public tenders for the settlement of an application for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for initiation in connection with a call for tenders and a public contest." said Pravo, the head of Plzen Antonie Zelena's Public Prosecutor's Office, knowing that more explanations are forbidden because the investigation is under way.
The police released this 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To know how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate with regard to so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that police officers had actually arrested Plzen in a separate workplace and that in the course of the public competition.
"He acted as a client and in no case did an employee, she specified.
The public competition according to Cerna has the real name "Call for rights to transfer land under the Land Act" and is set up when several legal candidates show up.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their reciting rights which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of the buyers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's spokesperson.
Lubos G. had, of course, the information concerning the persons who had applied for the appeal and as he himself is also a beneficiary because having bought a large number of restitution rights, he had offered candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably in the process of withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his inquiry.
Lubos G. had contacts largely above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
He was included in the case of the former chief of FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for the criminal prosecution for publishing land for which the decision to establish a construction had already been edited.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where access artery to the industrial area of Borske Pole had to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the mayorate for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The mayor's office was obliged to accept it because otherwise it might put construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about 100 crowns monthly for housing.
From January households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
The families will therefore have to remove from their wallet from January up to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to one tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should be around 100 crowns annually for households in apartments more than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices due to the development that is sensitive to encouraging the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
They are mainly the largest municipalities planning the increase in prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the people of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If rents do not change pests they will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemian, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
Regular rentals paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
The Czech children are feasting on rum and hay. Beer is no longer fashionable and is acting gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
They are drinks that most often bring those who feast, who are not yet 15 years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from hospitals' children's departments.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
'The trend is really strong alcohols', says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemian.
"When they manage to crack a bottle of papa in the cupboard, it's sometimes wisky but it's the fernat and vodka that prevails."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and don't feel it," says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for Motol Hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or Fernet."
"Today is alcohol in fashion, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, he acted as a Slavic who brought them back from the house," said Jurinova.
According to the head of the department of Pelikan, seeing drunk children aged from thirteen to fourteen years of age at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol, where he had just ten years of pediatrics where ambulances brought students from large areas completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times.
"She began her twelve-year-old career when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with plus a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their tolerance out of the ordinary because their rejections are due to the drinking that are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"In terms of alcohol, we hear a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result in alcohol, but we don't find it in children."
"In those who use repeat alcohol, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," said the Chief of Department of Pelikan.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, approximately forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic at Motol.
Only cases with severe poisoning requiring hospitalization are integrated into statistics.
Drinking children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, he existed according to Pélikan three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of the witches, the saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Whether they drink in spite of bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course I lived on the day of the witches an admission of seven drunk children at once," Pélikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffers the day after the "wood mouth".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients needed by the body.
"They are for this better lotis as they spend an excellent evening then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised at where they are," says Pélikan, aware that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can reach tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drink cost and that they could spend the entire summer working seasonally to repay one evening," Pélikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover care-related expenses from parents, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 planes are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft in all, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport planes, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer sits.
This is the first time that such devices become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration thefts.
These are the two-place versions of the L-159T1 that have so far been in service in the Czech army and were in flight.
The remaining three devices are single-season versions of L-159.
They are currently staying at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the Omnipol firm - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody planes is for the moment unknown.
'The L-159 single-seaters for the exchange have been taken on long-stocked aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The two places L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He noted that the army will not remain without biplace since in May 2009 the department signed with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million kroner for the transformation of four L-159 monoplaces unused into two.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the one who takes L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and will be used for training pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to do this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched an invitation to tender and has contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that trade ensures future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army purchased 72 aircraft from Aéro Vodochody and only used 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes is likely to have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because aircraft should have been selected as part of a European call for tenders and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the ring is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have the longest index than the ring are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple risk test for prostate cancer, especially for men before 60 years old," proclaimed co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo prostate cancer test, including by combining genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right hand index shorter than the ring.
For them as for the 19% of those with fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the ring, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years the risk decrease reached 87 per cent.
The length of the two fingers cited - trained during the prenatal period - indicates, inter alia, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less than testosterone is a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but does not seem to him to think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is in the snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czech as most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time of compact snow, the shredders worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 road in Brno towards Prague is the same fate.
The Dispatcher of the Central Car Club (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st km of a truck was injured, at the 93th two heavy weights struck, the accident injured.
Several cars also found themselves in the pit.
The problems are also on the highway D1 to 185th km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter the 182 km in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers formed in this place.
Also on Highway D11, there is an accident and, that, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow of several centimeters of thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, rows of cars are created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tramways take a delay, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, Prague's chief crisis officer still needs to meet.
Railways and airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to delete because of the 7 quick links.
Lines such as Prague in Kralupy or Prague in Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. at night until 5 p.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but redoubled with vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impracticable, on the road to Brno it begins to be in places of snowflakes and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain channels of communication in the places above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
To date the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snow mowers and strawberries.
We can't estimate for now when they're rolling.
On the road to Hodonin caution is strict in the white Carpathians region.
On roads that are, in view of the protection of nature, maintained only by the sprinkling of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In Chechnya, it fell between two and 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemian, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow was gradually disappearing in Chechnya.
Americans have a new "intelligent weapon"
The U.S. Army sent to Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon, known only as code XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and will "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its shells are guided by laser with precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm-calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly destructive explosive, actually works as small grenades.
Munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
Nor is it protected from above and when he falls upon a deadly rain of steel bursts, it can also put him out of combat.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, obtains a specific point of focus, according to which he corrects his targeted site and supports the relaxation.
"Let's say you've targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the relaxation, the weapon loads and shoots at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 job relocations
The Fujitsu group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace that is currently located in the office building of Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates his branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the giant specialized in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, so far located on the Marienbader Square of Bad Homburg City, will be transferred to Astro Park, the huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, the group should bring together 100 other jobs still scattered to date in the region.
The offer of rental was extremely attractive. Also, Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the working methods of employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that connection to the airport is precisely of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region yesterday caused the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the city of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "planetary actor" had been thus conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of establishment".
Fujitsu suits the city and its implementation is an important momentum for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have proposed our assistance to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relationships could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in the face of the owner of the Marienbader Place building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now about avoiding a place so exceptional that it remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and dancer of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville building, used so far by Fujitsu and the neighbouring "small vertical" company, as well as the rest of the Marienbad Square buildings, was part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance of the city was created between the station and the city hotel. It provoked many criticisms, not only because of the impressive design of the areas that used to be used in parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company for rating and investment advice, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer still associated with Siemens, moved to the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt Immobilien-Chancen purchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu along with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. One year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group with its headquarters in Tokyo considers itself the third largest provider of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
His branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu definitely has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This old 20-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses among others the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electronic Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing increasing difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may conceal political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, appears to be staying in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is attacked with increasing force.
The cyber-activist group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, probably lives in Great Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom" indicated on Wednesday (local time) cyber activists at the origin of revelations via the Twitter social network.
Earlier, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Following the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to achieve the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television channel, cited by Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation of Senator Joe Lieberman's employees.
The president of the Senate Committee on Territorial Protection had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I wish Amazon would take this action earlier in view of the previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," the honourable senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner. In doing so, it puts our national security at risk and endangers life all over the world," said an independent senator's statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, appears on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information from the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has constantly described as orchestrated intrigues by his detractors the prosecutions brought against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats were reported against the site.
"Calls have even been issued for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Chief of Government Counsel Mr. Stephen Harper stated ironically on television that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for American President Barack Obama, described the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we should deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," said Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government now completely passes to the test bench the protection of its databases.
According to a statement by the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Centre for Counter-Terrorism, was appointed to deal with the leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "the necessary structural reforms" made essential after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify how all administrations exchange and protect information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists so that they were ever threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything to get in touch with them," said the spokesperson of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Glace
At Bologna's "Gelato" University, ice confiscators are being prepared at the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracting visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does the whole ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, that is, in German the slightly outdated ice confectioner, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, we don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cannot avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbets founded the ice university in 2003 to ensure that ice creams out of its machines meet the high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracting visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extended over several days. Also, practical sessions are organized in private glaciers.
In the middle of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others are simply at risk of achieving their burning desire for smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, art teacher from California is proud of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a quality European product in the future in the country of industrial ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business manager and, after a few years, she wants to draw a few things out of this challenging profession for nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
Not only is good taste decisive, but also silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees by means of an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it produces a pasteurized base white cream, based on all kinds of milk ice.
The trainer is immediately called into question: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabilizers?
How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of time.
Those who only speak of ice "manufactured from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, e.g. guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
Of course it is possible to manufacture ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will crochet nothing but ice granules.
Some changes in the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients purchased in the fruit or confectionery ray of the supermarket.
In addition, there is dust and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to refill you with dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Be in the fruits sorbet recipes with fresh sugar and fresh fruit.
Both in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it becomes yellow cream and constitutes, when added to cocoa powder, the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and walnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more pure fruit: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The hazelnut ice does not necessarily contain the taste of the walnut, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly reflects the taste of an ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation exercise: if we use fishing powder with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the vines use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as it used to be.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the mixture of ice is simultaneously beaten to make it unctuous and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, small panels are not excluded.
Brazil's Gustavo is a fruit-purity barbeque from head to foot and thus slaps his fellow students when the control of the colossal bowl blender escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that an "accident such as this may occur in each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experimentes with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has drowned the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now made by the group of Testbiotech experts who is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Munich M. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper worked decisively to develop the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements developed are in accordance with the Ilysi pressure group's position and thus bear the trade mark of the industry which, in substance, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A senior head of the Ephesus recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without condition or transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
A short time ago, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the control authority of the European Union and the industrial lobby, which aroused both the suspicions of the German Federal Environment Agency and of Members of the European Parliament.
However, Ephesus does not admit any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he was working for the International Life Sciences Institute (Illi) based in the United States.
This body is considered to be a neutral forum involving experts from, among other things, science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being the result of lobbying.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feed test and the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know, for example, what the impacts of genetically modified maize cause to the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plants, which do not allow reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we find them?" asked Mr. Then about an accuser.
That is also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region and in the United States, as well as in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are hardly any other researchers who are not related to companies.
In the company's view, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls security research".
The stone trail
Uli Gsell searched for it, approximately 400 kilograms.
Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was something wrong.
He was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish much of the northern wing.
Stuttgart's world was no longer the same: several thousand people showed against project S21, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was ruined when demonstrations led to the cessation of construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and rough pavement not built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He's been looking for a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claims that in cutting it to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with that fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
the traces of Stuttgart's stones lead to a former deposit of French army munitions in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition that occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were defeated or disappeared in the dump," he said in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He said he was insulted and threatened when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything to oppose demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to keep using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone umbrellas weighing an average of 80 kilograms, the value of which is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep him as a memory at all, hoping he could also make him at a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscaped gardeners, Particuliers.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could enter the safe and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long turned into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass strips.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"in the summer this political component."
He enters his car all over the land, turns his vast 20 acres empire.
He did law studies that he had abandoned. Later, he began studying biology before he subsequently became interested in computer science and finally became a career.
And a stone lover.
The stock is 40000 tons.
He grew treasure all over Germany.
He claims he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's coming back.
Sand stones carved with art are placed on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that climbs through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: Red sandstone, before, part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Goli travertin."
The parallelepid was once part of the Neckarstadion rostrum of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the red granite from the cathedral of Saint Blasien, the tuft from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that once the stones were carved by hand and moved using simple shovels and carts drawn by oxen, he became quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put in place."
He hasn't become rich, even less rich.
But today this career employs 14 people. Moreover, stone keepers, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We're working hard, but it's gratifying," says the waste recycling company.
Soon, he must go to Cologne.
There too, there are stones to save.
Battle of talent to conquer high potentials
The counter has a strong flow.
16 students huddle to buy small salmon breads, tomato sauces and white-foods.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the automotive manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a sort of contest of ideas, they need to talk trade about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to identify better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multi-form cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most skilled graduates as far as possible in amphitheatres before they arrive on the employment market and are not brokered by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about their students' performances, they try to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig the car group loves talent.
A young staff lady shares the styles, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs for young talents; she shows them the ways to access the group's center.
Nico Selle of the technical university of Braunschweig is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industry and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who enter online as a collaborator."
According to Mr Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive with which we try to attract students.
"In the past, the emphasis was rather on the professional project," says Mr.Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much worse.
In sector goods, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a kyriella of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all broker the highly qualified workforce.
These are mainly the graduates from the engineering lines who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI's forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will expand further.
Roman Dykta goes to talent hunting on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting expertise and counseling.
It organizes costly events to recruit talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a sort of rally-paper where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel this way to the United States.
Participants can visit KPMG subsidiaries and know the company.
The participant shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the resources used to search for high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For Mr. Dykta's talent hunter, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have been in contact with all those who took part last year in similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct softness carried out on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises work in a very classic way by participating in the professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We're trying to reach the graduates by participating in the trade fairs."
"For example, at the Solar Technology Fair," said Ms. Sitha Stübe, director of human resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company installed in Bonn employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is aware of the problem of resurgence.
Currently, 35 posts are being awarded on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacant positions."
"That costs money and takes a lot of time," does he make sure?
Another way to establish contact is to go through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with different higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional internships or to write his final study project at home."
Onerous advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to make its advertising by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"A large group often can't do that," said Stübe, chief of staff.
Money has long lost its main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good promotion opportunities are the other key factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual board of honour of German employers.
To this end, he asked employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and their context while looking at employee framework conditions.
The Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hoped that this investment would enhance the company's image with job seekers.
"I think the candidates are referring mainly to external evaluations of a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first of all taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When they treat their employees well and identify with the company, they only advertise their employer to their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," said Mr. Kriegler.
Obama brakes the new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, Southeastern United States, over the coming years.
The Government of Washington has issued a ban An equivalent prohibition and thus definitively annulled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains banned for the time being.
Secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform, which is at the root of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this one-off accident and leading to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to allow for new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
In this way, supporters of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries on oil supply.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating black tide in golf is not so far resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims for compensation of several billion, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry established by Obama must present its current conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the ice from the prescribed drilling after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter safety requirements, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently being thoroughly reformed.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that they would remove the tax niches of gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector now publicly warn against the fact that the feed flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" as a result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm prior to the Wednesday drilling ban.
In addition, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to a new order, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
Water flowing in the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to that in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the country Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live on theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
"Don't wear out," launches the environmental activist to the journalists to calm them down: "You're still enough oil mud today in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man stuck in muddled water to the chest, as well as the fat sleigh surrounding it: This scene seems almost beautiful in the burst of water in the color of the rainbow.
It can't be seen that the basement is full of brown crude oil napps.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom said that she was then collecting shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil fell from an oil pipeline that exploded in the immense tide.
Fishermen living in the small town nearby Bodo must now be reduced for six hours to reach the fishy waters: Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the ravages jumps to the eyes as mangrove marshes crossed through watercourses.
Instead of clear water, the motor boat splits a brown crading water. Whoever dips his hand takes away all over oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground as olive trees. The isolated palm trees leave their palms sad.
Bird clouds are sought in vain, as they are usually found in the wetlands: As long as the off-board engine stops, a ghostlike silence falls on this old paradise that looks like a service station by the smell it releases.
"What happens here is war on the environment," said Mr. Celestine Akpobari with a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where Ogoni live has been a battleground for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. the latter was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous to its employees.
Today, the return to Ogoni country is prohibited: while more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the Ogoni country's oil fields are not exploited because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All of the few hundred meters stand in the water of steel truces as strange sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are rubbed by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks down from time to time in pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have been spent on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to the amount that has flowed into the sea during the accident of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution?The answer to this question divides the actors.
For Shell, oil pipeline sabotage and syphoning are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider drilling heads explosions and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell group of applying essentially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of conduct is "even higher than ally".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of camouflage and installed in the open air: they are completely naked and covered with cambouis up to the neck.
A sparklight under one of the many tons that are sometimes connected to pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the tonne for several hours, Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline penetrates into a container through pipes, then at the end of the conduct of kerosene droplets fall and eventually obtain diesel.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre Diesel barrels daily: "This reports us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta people are benefiting from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low 40 cents Euro per litre of Diesel: Because they buy their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the oil pipeline network in perce throughout the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very insignificant small part of the provisionally stored raw material is unlawfully purified: Organized crime networks that also have high-ranking politicians and military members, charge the lion's share in tankers and raid it on the world market.
Activist Akpobari believes that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the mode of lax production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the life of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relations, especially with regard to Shell, have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of withdrawing the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, may be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time for you to detach" announces the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them pots of wine.
Even mostly soldiers from the north of the country intend to take advantage of the raw material like all Nigerians.
"In any case, this piece of shit has dropped our country very low," says Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in the A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
By examining an aircraft that carried out an emergency landing, investigators have discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
Early in November, Airbus passengers belonging to the Quantas company were visibly more likely: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of certain A380 devices presented a serious security problem, and it cautioned against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could result in serious consequences: It can cause fatigue and leaks in connection with oil conduct, it is indicated in a position published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
She could have led to a "catastrophic failure of reactors".
The reactors produced by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft of the A380 series are concerned.
The Airbus of the Quantas company, which had to land urgently on November 4 in Singapore, is one of them.
The Australian airline has now initiated judicial proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against society.
The director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damages in respect of the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that causes damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced around the world.
Australian investigators announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with relevant reactors.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, the spokesperson for ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, the Quantas airline had immobilized its entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilised three of its eleven A380.
The company Lufthansa replaced, by a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest line plane in the world.
Snowfall across the territory causes chaos in transport
All-white-covered Germany: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
In the winter, Germany is rocking: By freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 National in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they were unable to end the snow that continued to accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects this to take place on the Baltic Coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowmas on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the weather alert plant Meteomedia announced the level of violet alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
By places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars stayed stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxon-Anhalt land, the police authorities announced serious road disturbances.
On Highway A2, snow and wind caused a disruption of traffic and caused plugs.
In Thuringe, snowfalls hit motorways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disturbances in rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees falling on the railways, catenary or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, we had to interrupt interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its trip.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply 165 train passengers with blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfalls have resulted in many flight cancellations at the main airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesman and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, although only 400 beds have been made available.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
At night in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was stopped there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a ton on a sliding pavement in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and dusty, but it will cloud in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to at least 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her twin tours.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to news reports, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could account for up to EUR 500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just beautified the group's headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business Quarter have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
The financial group then clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as written in the newspaper "Finance Times Deutschland", quoting a spokesman.
This spokesperson did not state the reasons for the planned sale.
He said, "We'll check if it's more interesting to take care of the buildings ourselves or sell them, and rent them again later."
This is how Germany's largest financial institution has already surrendered its headquarters shortly thereafter.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of EUR 272 million from the holders of own funds and then re-assigned them.
Energy optimization transformations have included, according to some indications, around EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the tours, renamed in the meantime "Green Tour", at about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people cry to the minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the underprivileged minors who were declared dead following several explosions in a mine.
We haven't been able to climb the bodies yet because the security situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 minors between 17 and 62 years of age had been buried below the ground.
A probe had been introduced into the damaged well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no relief team could descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors were no longer in a position to survive.
Until now the bodies could not be raised.
Today, parents and friends have organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a sun exploding in Greymouth south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 underage minors, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothes and surfing boards, also had their place.
The flags were put in front of all the public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative festival that New Zealand had nurtured the hope that minors would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits said he could not resign to accept his son's death until he had seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats took part in the memorial celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South island of New Zealand.
Police prefect Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas masses are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine are beginning to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic from the fighter.
To which audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think well by shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) having only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his burrow and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents after each other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of a bloody action, just because our hero uses methods of brutal murder. When he is in bad mood, he pulls out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the burg said no words on its real name. Even other characters let escape, at most, from one or two sentences a few frightening cry of agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and feast in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the setting of the Vikings universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travels.
When a film targets several target groups, it is unfortunate that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher", his trilogy related to the drug dealer, full of style, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the cinema of art and trial.
Most art cinema sympathizers have to experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and through the intestines.
Lovers of action films die from boredom, when the burgundy departs, for reasons that can be interpreted freely, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to shut up.
It is not surprising then that "Wallalla Rising" found no film distributor in Germany and that there is only DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of poverty that have merited some attention, but also because the image of a palpitating film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is ambience, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The spectator can't escape it.
Refn gives him hardly a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a lubricated soundtrack, but especially with an insatiable hatred that springs from the heart of the characters.
Only a blond boy, who loyally stands by the side of the border, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are excited by anger.
More than anything else, the fierce hero whose furniture is never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by becoming a warrior, may be sending out of the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, nothing but for those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims to disturb, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious terrace work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a stand on this issue, even less subject to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building in Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the largest town nearby is 30 km: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is found in IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepid, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing of United States intelligence services, the CIA, dated late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring town, el-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a presentation video with blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant that represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building nearby, even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information than at the time, and even in time, the mystery has grown thicker and thicker.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built an El-Kibar reactor, but had little evidence showing that country developed "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumed reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation "opportunity".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as IAEA.
Questioned about how he is making sure that he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a laconical response in the summer, stating that IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly hastily removed the debris of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical approach to the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in El-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial providers through a Member State showing the moment that followed the attack directly. It appears that they are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damas argues that uranium found on the site comes from Israel's weapons.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analysis of particles by calling it a reliably intractable.
Since then, ladies have refused any discussion on this matter, as have satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refuses access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
This is how the investigation into this case has been delayed since June 2008 without a result and that it "is becoming increasingly a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, is ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that in order to achieve progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other installations which must have "functional relation" with the alleged reactor.
To date, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are here for, or what their function or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known in the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also as neighbouring cities.
Washington's Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for International Science and Security) identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone umbrella to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "be used for fuel production".
It would have "no indications concerning sensitive activities", such as the enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there is strong plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental questions: from where uranium should have come and where plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether engravings, which could hide high-value traces, were stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of land trucks have disappeared, no one will have information on the place of storage of engravings.
For IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined the al-Tibni salt mine in 1998 only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
By analyzing recent photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley established a link between them and the reactor in question.
However, photos taken by satellite show that Syria has undertaken landslide work on the three suspicious and displaced large containers when IAEA begins to demand access to these places.
It may be a coincidence, but this has not helped to dispel suspicions.
In the diplomatic circles, it is said that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out. This plan was to enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only time spent shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, for example, says Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been referring to special inspections for a few months, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA Director, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, certainly has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation of escalation.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought to: "It would be useful if they did not find anything at all"
Love in Wartime
It's bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in summer as a director.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but that's enough to cause illness.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian ass during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Federations of Bosnian Women protested immediately. In response, certain shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved in the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still taking place in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war has sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she has demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is a good-willed ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she proposed to these women to have a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says enough about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner that he withdraw his capacity as a good-willed ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of Jolie scenario did she write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, has granted some hesitations a shooting permit to Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not then come despite this authorization.
The young author herself ensures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she has been aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all stakeholders the opportunity to express herself.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the war began. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
What is still a big difference with the version "a victim of rape is muttered by his ass."
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, as Jolie expresses herself, is "unjust and based on incorrect information".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: By illegally placing this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, it's all going well again with the Irish.
no trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overdoes visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy at the bottom of strong music, they trample their feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in southern Ireland vibrates because the players are launching and succeed in dropping table tennis balls at a distance of three metres in beer goblets from the opposing team.
This weird show is called "beer-pong". The winner buys 500 Euros plus an airplane ticket to go to the World Cup in Las Vegas in January.
Cyan Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the computerist reserved, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the tender question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"But I feel a strange feeling," he says.
"The home country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she took her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are fulfilled, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, sorrow now takes all the place.
The economic crisis, however, is particularly affecting well-trained young Irish people, who have only experienced moments of happiness so far.
Loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
In the meantime, however, three people in ten less than thirty years of age are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes widely the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes towards drift."
"There should be a rise against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the potential to do so leaves and our country so a whole generation."
"The last one to leave turns out the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a darker future because the government only throws dust in the eyes and offers no future prospects for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades crumble from a practical internship not paid to another.
She states that it is her greatest concern to migrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to address this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" exhibition, which offers full support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," he says.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gall, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just came out of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hanover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, so that he can finish paying back the credit he has contracted to build his home in his home country.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't live nearly anymore."
He burst out of a embarrassed laugh through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-maintained front gardens, expensive cars of large brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, funded 100 percent by credit.
"It was times of madness, no doubt, money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan is thinking for a moment, reserts hot tea and says: "I don't have kids to entertain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer does not like the regrets he has heard in recent times.
"No one must suffer from hunger, but our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," he said.
"Working for a while abroad is not what can happen worse, maybe that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his bookcase, He already has a few years of work in London. That is why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that concerns him well in the last few days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a farewell night.
"Only not a lot of emotions," he said by drinking a long beer throat.
"A good-bye, it seems still worrying."
"Let's call it a good-bye evening, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does the support for private enterprise.
Crime has become more of a concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows changes in the attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey in September and early October.
The first is the quite sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has grown from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has improved after a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, thus reducing the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of the region's respondents expressed satisfaction with how their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Figure 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but they were up high compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America have shaken support for democracy.
While this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have experienced only a brief recession and have experienced a great recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty has increased only slightly in 2009 and has again fallen to 32 per cent this year.)
But mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
About 31% say that they or someone close to them have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure has fallen from 38% last year and has been the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuela's respondents are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest lead in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and in most Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country suffered and plunged into fear.
Voting boxes and new ballots, ballot papers scattered in the gutters, sacked polling offices and intimidations were presented
The polling stations would open late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who had been displaced following the January earthquake, would be in the vicinity to find out where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, have denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community prudently stated that they did not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they were, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are liable to René Préval, an unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no perceptible support in the electorate, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tower to reach the second round.
With an outbreak of cholera that rages, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake that still live in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
The weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, has received a wave of public sympathy that has improved her approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term during an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, visibly in mourning, according to which she would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And in that regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income on will.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has subsided in the disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, leaving the President even more room for manoeuvre to spend on will.
The economy overheats widely: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage claims, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, gave priority to growth and poverty reduction rather than to inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now adjust these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation has eroded the growth rate after a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government entered into an agreement with the obligors who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández looks to be edging targets an agreement with creditors governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it is worth $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of the Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which resembles a prelude to the sanitation of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is no longer on her side.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which the kirchnerism is very good.
When the Argentines returned from their summer vacation in Mars, the wave of sympathy for her would have flown.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to repudiate or not, without noise, many policies of her husband.
Half an hour for China
Taiwanese voters are heading towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What do Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters presented themselves on November 27, 70% of eligible people, to elect municipal mayors and councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for feelings vis-à-vis the continent, having developed innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the greatest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. My test was successful, but just right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayorates, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressive Party (DPP), which focused on Taiwan's full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including bullying trucks and mass gathering flags with girls who danced in minimum.
An attempt at mandatory mysterious murder has also been carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary KMT president, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters towards the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid stopping its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from activating the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed a confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to attract Taiwan, back to the port.
China has not lost time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start with the beginning.
Better wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has been reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, it was wrong: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison following charges of corruption.
He was a challenger for explicit independence from 2000 to 2008.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Mrs Tsai and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a candidate for the DPP in the Chair, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented an "alternative worthy of trust" with respect to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr Chen seems to be overwhelmed by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic one, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
The KMT must have an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's evaluations were low; despite vertigious economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between the rich and the poor.
A spokesperson from KMT said his cabinet and local antennas would be remodeled.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for reconciliation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
To do so at the request of a president, and people are required to become aware of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer picked up by President Obama by hand to take place during his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of Grammy Awards this year with a major appointment in the category of the "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, "Esperanza", the appointment remains somewhat mysterious but is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards that an artist should not go out more than three albums before recording; which "set the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skilled hands of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to Norah Jones' lightning success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards voters, taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
In other cases, Grammy Awards voters have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "toolal album" category, a shift on a reinvigorating frisson from a record that was one of the prime favorites last year.
Among these I Yesterday, "Moody 4B" by Veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favored by the raucous voice of New Orleans and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme", was honored in the category of contemporary jazz; which is also strongly inclined towards a certain fusion with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin's and Jeff Lorber's.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the great class; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Together and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic appointments for the 53rd Grammy Annual Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations, we mention Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
Classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 by Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "God Ex Macina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Dashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - l'art des Castrati" featured various artists; and the "Requiem" by Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" of Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choeur of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoe" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had its first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of approximately 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was appointed for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he soon wrote the work of 15 minutes especially for the performer at the Avi Avivital Mandoline, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and many ranges and rhythms from North Africa," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received an appointment in the category of orchestra benefits, for having led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organizer Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalists-solists; here are Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for his recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula mosque project is approved by the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Criticism has taken place in the project by claiming that it is promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the Commissioners decided Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahaïs, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I am proud of it, as an American citizen."
"She shows that justice takes her."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very loud voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, at the speaking time approximately also distributed, according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no more America," wrote one speaker.
"It's another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The Islamic planning centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, where the attacks of 11 September 2001 took place in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmush denounced the violence in Temecula Valley.
Its congregation of 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse it rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque with Mediterranean style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents may still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can be developed either with phosphorus, or with arsenic."
"That is why it is very special, even though it is far from being a truly "foreign" way of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing the phosphorus with the arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other global environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felicia Wolfe-Simon, NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that one microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is mainly toxic because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work exactly like the phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow erases the work of our biochemical machine," explained Anbar.
Researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with the phosphorus but the fact that it can live with the arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using the arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Deputy Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, that the arsenic could be replaced by the phosphorus, was not new; but nothing ever showed that this could work.
The arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth's existence, she said; thus, researchers have made the assumption that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not only the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two exposure dogs on four thefts outside of a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of Los Angeles County announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening Wednesday, said to Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the Los Angeles county sheriff's department.
"The good news is that dogs are doing well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't mean it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in Downey County.
The sheriff's deputies found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and safe, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, had disappeared until their discovery Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National Long Beach "AKC/Eukauba" championship, where they were planning to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other tests planned in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC/Eukauba", Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and keep their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a parson Russell terrier and a Breton spagnal - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left Akitas and the corgis in thicker fur in the van where it would be fresher.
They opened the windows a little, so the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the corgis, with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward has been awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to roar again, the restructuring of MGM no longer waits for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start again at zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially leased Thursday the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that about $5 billion of the debt would be cleared; opening the way for the entertainment company, having 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television shows.
With the decision of Thursday, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no further legal obstacles remain before MGM to float under the supervision of founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become directors general of what will be an alleged studio.
The staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility to finance new operations and productions of MGM.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio restructuring process began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was initiated to advise management on how to place its finances because it did not have the means to pay interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and to meet more than 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company on sale at the end of 2009.
However, auction sales attracted few bidders among whom none of them were willing to pay the additional 2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again when the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreement and debate, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially quit bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already obtained $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have collected $375,000 a month for their management services of the company, will receive a "primary of success" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch the production of MGM, which released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio has to make a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which Peter Jackson has to make.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to carry out a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not reach an agreement.
Tech toys to maintain your balanced gift budget
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jumping strings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget balanced.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technology toy is likely to have more strength; while at the same price or a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known ones, Webkins and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And buttons toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable toys.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise specified.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are toys of the size of an Indian pig who sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several of them, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays around role games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have missed the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you will remember Alpha, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a back bag filled with questionnaire playing cards designed to transform a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve classifier.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes type system to offer electronic games and books and has a SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and over) is a set of just five blocks larger than a box of lighters, each having its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impumptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkins and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 years) which includes a marked piece of a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credit from Club Penguin for two items at your choice.
It can be wheelchair skates or a pet toy Puffle.
slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the last micro-robots to stack button.
The false beast moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a smoother side to order maintenance in China
Tang Shenbin was climbing a place in the city like an urban sergeant at training by seriously inspecting his nerve charges, casting low orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chegguan - leaders of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and thought of violence - to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Stand straight!"
"Be obnoxious!"
Show them, he says, "what do the pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and trousers, looked at your guard.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, in line with the rule.
Four neat hats perfectly ground at the top of hair attached by a knot striped in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with indignation.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
Guangdong Province has exchanged green grey uniforms against a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced them with a strong look: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack trolley by throwing dark eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the Colporteur had packed his business and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to perform a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas of 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, yellow and young.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulty drawing attention to this underground urban brigade in China
And because of that, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media depict news from a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei beat an observer to death after using his mobile phone to film them while spreading a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing, stolen and online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastry worker was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game filled with violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained as street vendors assault.
"Chenguan has marked the government," lamented China Daily last year, a national publication, after an enormous controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real complete cleaning."
The skeptics say that the approach is far from it.
After the District announced in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The District Announcement required female candidates between 18 and 22 years of age to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They must have a size greater than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
The officers said that work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First of all, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; this is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "interior qualities."
The women of Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement regarding the order of the facial features.
That means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabilities should not apply.
"We can't let a person who can box or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has potatoes with a finely curved mouth.
She does not regard the enhancement of her appearance as gender, she says.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for wasted air.
Xu Yang, his colleague at the coffins of 21 years of age, said: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not oppose their mandate being limited, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into the streets where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen travelling merchants who travel quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as much bread or tofu bowls as possible before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you many times!" said Mrs. Xu, while a vendor ran off on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-cart with noodles.
Agents describe their functions rather as monotonous than hard.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that the Cheggan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and police officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were hit or shot.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks of placid houses Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle screamed at the scandal.
A 15-minute-long iron arm followed before the police, in their sinister face, broke a elbowway towards their vehicle and left at full speed with the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the male team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, male coordinators 40 years of age or older are merely supportive.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"We sometimes beat ourselves verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li, "it's a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, the public is starting."
The prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice lifted the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to a former campaign assistant and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the woman's husband, announced on Wednesday the Senator's lawyers.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential until the scandal surrounding his case did not make the major national titles last year and harm his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" by the decision, the result of a one-year survey.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice has refrained from commenting on this issue.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the Senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law for a year from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seemed in contradiction with the so-called lobbying door ban.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the law of the rotating door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to be suspicious of political prosecutions after a number of high-level charges by its section of public integrity, including decisions taken last year to abandon prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens for lack of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the general director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a defence group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Lawyer of Mr. Ensign, stated in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor from Monday's Department of Justice and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against its client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyer team had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as her office reaffirmed in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the public prosecutor's office.
"I am not comfortable entering into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an inquiry following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr.Ensign's parents to Hampton violated federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's head of office, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martelized" the Ministry of the Interior on a dispute issue.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and he asked the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had engaged Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his position as leader in the fourth Republican rank in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to fight a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said that the honourable senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice quickly and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were being tapped away in the courtroom rows.
They sent out horrible testimony reports every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape case trial and children tied to their beds in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three Cheshire members in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence to the court that sketches arguments of appeal, which are likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is causing, is that intense reports on the trial - as well as widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "cirque atmosphere ", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by public passions.
The request could lead the judges of appeal to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms is detrimental to the human rights of a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleu of the Superior Court of State, has laconically rejected the claims in the judgment made last week, claiming that the media were "scrutinously controlled" and there was no evidence that the jury would have been excited by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the matter.
The appeal courses have recognized for decades that media coverage of well-known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgement dated, the U.S. Supreme Court annulled the conviction of an osteopath from Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for his wife's murder, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere to the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers stated that the appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication of the hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue asserts that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from courtrooms might allow more fair trials.
Twitter is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, who may be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre pictures of criminal scenes when selecting the jury.
Some of the jurors reported being horrified by photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge has unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who has been criticized before the prosecutors, and that he has improperly put pressure on a verdict by taking the unusual decision to lead the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors have not been kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a dispute against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for the position of Governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media did not cease to trigger the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily riot of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "they didn't look like anything that had been seen here before, in New Haven, and maybe even at the national level."
Their focus on coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion, that the new snapshots were more incendiary than the more slow releases, was a ludistic view that would weaken the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeals were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966 which had overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote, representing that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civilization bring the cleavage closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a foreword to true bipartisan cooperation forward or from an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not result in any breakthrough on the major issues to be addressed during the session of the "boxy duck".
But clearly, there was at least a polite discussion on the differences between the two parties and on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points. void of partisan point notation.
The Committee's Wednesday public meeting on the President's deficit was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap; but that still divides members.
It is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of testing and testing each other to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain within miles of distance.
Yet, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed over the tone," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now next to the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
Elections give rise to partisan passions, and then they collapse.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "boxy duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or whole, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is envisaged on the extension of unemployment allowances, which would only be because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for rich people, while refusing unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is planned on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "boxy duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warned that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame Duck" session would not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress would meet in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once the things that must be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadowboxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the Chamber and to the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
But Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are now clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, reversing retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their own opinion, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the Commission, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected members; this suggests that there is little reason or will to compromise on tax matters, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fights between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, given that the Republicans are challenging Obama's budget, taxes and health care; and then followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause change?
Public opinion.
It is widely demonstrated that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged to be lost will have to change his mind and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the militants of both parties saw 2010 as a simple prelude to a larger election in 2012.
In view of this reality, this week's civilization could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a ground for understanding on the issues that still divide them.
Disseminated American documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes to the Kremlin some of the pots of wine and the money of protection it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical power" - takes its part while the money walks up the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been excommunicated.
It was written while Yuuri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he was largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but since then there have been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a leading construction company, have always denied the charges of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamatory trials on these charges.
In September, he said what follows on a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to a overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy report; and it is unusual to think that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the government of the city of Moscow and crime led some people to call it "disfunctional" and to claim that the government acted more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the embassy's note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (the term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means "top" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB holds the money of the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to obtain protection from MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note points out that although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business close on one pretext or another.
Medvedev mentioned several times the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy's note conveys reports of men bringing bags, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev is dependent on bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's "think tank Indem".
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the costs of corruption would amount to more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy's note, which was only realized yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly remove discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may, to some extent, be blamed for Moscow's failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that the problem is being resolved.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin issued the assumption that WikiLeaks' documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the statements that U.S. diplomats had disclosed to him by calling him Batman and approaching Robin's Medvedev.
"The problem is based on the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in that country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Veterans of the Red Khmers forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with low-quality deciduous concrete walls, the manager of the high school in Anlong Veng mentioned the man who built it, the last leader of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Red Khmers northwestern Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former troops of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers went to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally challenged to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, taught the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly headed with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, at 35 years in prison, the former head of the sad famous Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this development, anxiety has increased with the veterans of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to re-enter Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Reds but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overbeing.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the Pol Pot-U.S. government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements arrived in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas of their base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to undermine the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had taken the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the old Khmer Red veterans have suffocated in black poverty, common to the rural regions of Cambodia; and many of them remain nostalgic to the movement.
Although some Khmer-Red elite officers have kept their positions as local leaders in exchange for depositing the weapons, they are unskilled farmers at low grade and low grade.
"These people have received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation that organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibed with the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a business environment is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer red as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"It's Mok feeding everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to support our own needs."
The current Khmer Red Court has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court is expected to begin the judgement of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer minister in red.
The court's mandate is to judge senior leaders and the principal perpetrators of crimes, but he did not say whether he continued beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears of Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64 years old, former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Red Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers were reportedly killed.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work to the field located near his wooden house on pilots, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she said she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is in peace and stable," she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who disefited the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians contest this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past, he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he said.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Red Khmer, "A history of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history manuals, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the high school in Anlong Veng, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, says Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he says.
However, the red Khmers retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by weeds and spread out of plastic bags, leads up to a rectangle of black silk, covered with a rusty roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, a mobile phone vendor on the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants will go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and, later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last place of rest where she would leave a bunch of mature bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its military quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it was going to abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué published after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials said in Washington Post that certain classified operations were carried out with Belarus over the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military quality uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way for a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the remainder of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to a staff member who referred to the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Safety Summit, organized on the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit Nuclear Safety Summit."
"It proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton called the agreement "very significant, important step" made by Belarus.
Obama pledged to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries rid themselves of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukachenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have maintained highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military quality uranium and low enriched uranium," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product ... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We'll use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus drew close to the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials indicated.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, said those responsible.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by aircraft, according to those responsible.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization has been implemented with a view to building confidence"; thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a manager of the Department of Energy Specializing in the Reduction of the Global Threat.
According to estimates by the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military quality uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The Government has made no objection to CIA theft
The government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked for the Spanish Executive to be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprising the Zapatero out of play" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence thefts over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid "taking them away," says Aguirre in a cable.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as she was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence capacity".
In January 2007, Public Prosecutor Vicente González, in turn, transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no criminal elements, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after talking to the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the declassified information of CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly among Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the Ambassador of the United States and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, commented to him that "even though the Spanish judges are madly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a ignited rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its overall pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has deliberately tolerated or ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The parricide that passed to the confessions complained in the network of the "suffering" of being mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terreur à la Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was young, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natives of Noia, the village of the Coruña whose origin she was.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear about them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC built with the help of his parents' testimony.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, industrial.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, it was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
He was Alberto, a young man from Lousam, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to sweat the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyllic fractured, they separated.
In March 2008, she is in Minorque alone and writes: "Alberto is very strange and vigilant because I came to work there."
"When I told him, it was a good thing for him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains: "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I will take it when I return," she says.
In May, she says about the return to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'm only going to stay there until 19 because I have to come to a job to not lose it."
She explains that if everything was okay, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him with another person if this person is not my mother," he said, in doubting intent, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there is another post.
When she taps it, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, was allegedly murdered on the 10th of that month, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not."
"On the one hand he's with me and this place he likes a little, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) at a few hours of summer and so I save some money from the baby sitter."
17 salutations and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos on the e-mail, you see, when he wants to, he finds me, shit."
On 30th, another: "The child is well, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "I'm moving forward with money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the now blocked MySpace universe, where her name was "Muki the liberator of the prison."
"Terreur a la galicienne (epigraphe) ".
The last man who lived with her, vigilante, declares her regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened so she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial prison in Palma yesterday, from the judicial detention centre in Minorque.
The Office's lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts had happened, "and she did not intend to hurt the minor."
Before she had confessed to having drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited her body in a suitcase.
The defence and prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
Members of the People's Party would earn 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats in Congress.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and Members recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, whether progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training gets in these comedians usually doubles the one it receives in Catalans.
For example, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in general in 2008, while at the 2006 autonomy, they had obtained 316,222 votes in general.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, a desire for a diversion of PCS votes and the loyalty of the PP electorate, the analysts of this training have calculated that, if there were general elections, the PCC could pass from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CIU would also win four (now 10) and PSC would lose neither more nor less than 9 MPs (at 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a member - he has three of them now - while ICV would keep a member or earn one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal committees, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relay to the head of the Barcelona General Council, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populars agree with the fact that CSP could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get the majority either the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fantastic if this training lost its representation in the City Hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, including the mayor, Ángel Ros, maintaining very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven prisoners in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three of them.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerians detained by officials of the General Police Information Commissioner of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of Bombay's attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, so as to ensure that with "Operation Kampai" has "stained" Al Qaida's counterfeiting device at international level and therefore "its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, within two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that included the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why the investigations took part, apart from Thai services, in other European police units, in the territory of the European Union, in the following days, similar to the one recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained in Thailand, another took place, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who were leading the cell implanted in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - a part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connects prisoners in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it must be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia we sent through a transfer agency a few miles of dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the integrations of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police seized a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
PPC leader Alicia Sánchez-Camacho had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Arthur Mas's conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and who resolves to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address in half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples arrived at the meeting with Arthur Mas with the security that gave the 18 Members of Parliament at the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the CiU candidate requires at least one of the opposition formations to abstain in the vote of the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the time being, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are becoming Catalan.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereignist and independentist speeches should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes even to submit to the referendum.
The two leaders are in common to undermine the political apparatus of a highly over-exhausted self-government and the elimination of taxes applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the Mas investment negotiation will take care of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICRC) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrics claim that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot Centre do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The managers of the Geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmaé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly persons whose responsibility he had been in the meantime.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with counsel from the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to bring charges against the responsible person" for the dead but "legality and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect in time the criminal activities of the infirmary at night, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmaé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected in many cases that no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality was done by telephone.
Through her director, Caritat categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an index of imprudence on the part of anyone but the accused."
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by injecting an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a sedative pill mix.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the staff of the centre to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to relieve the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila is not lying by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the range 12-17 October.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of convicted assassins, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being larger and justify their attitude by the various versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in how to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB Threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to the threat of Trichet yesterday that warned that "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity".
The differentials of the devices closed to force and the actions of the European banks suffered more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to deceive ourselves, and the euro has hardly recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but is motivated by short and very speculative closures.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" will be extended and will maintain the sale of unlimited access to quarterly auctions at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of markets yesterday and if they continue blind to withdraw liquidity measures, may God help us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered purchasing bonds and that they had collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday's one-year trade auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basic points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change of market sentiment after Trichet's words.
The figures for Allied and Bank of Ireland were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and have up to February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, figures are acceptable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it was necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in self-employed communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors' ears like the four Vivaldi seasons.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchange.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve with a strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to apply for a Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has over 40,000 million cash available, triple compared to March, very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "aside from being, to appear."
Brave, we can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will challenge Vega Sicilia's council requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "null de droit", El Enebro's judicial council on the 16th, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take advantage of the management bodies of the firm owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to give up in his dispute to be present in the El Enebro governing bodies.
From his Board of Directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting on January 18 this year whose dispute is registered in the Register of Commerce and Corporations.
El Enebro's judicial council for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, reopened the tuna box within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism which guarantees the assembly's convening.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is called by David Álvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants' five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly violating the Law and by abusing the law, validating and correcting the assembly radically null than January 18, according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the argument that, once the assembly takes place, it should be contested considering that it is "nothing of all right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a quiet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group calls for 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request for a complaint for which there is not yet a stated date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered Formula 1 world in 2004, his story in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all waged on the Ferrari de Fernando Alonso triumph.
The German Sebastien Vette, also the Renault engine's ability to drive its car, in the Formula 1 world we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
In reality, it is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with far-reaching goals from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains for manufacturing factories around the world, power stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to create and execute "in a short time, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-quality professionals are working, equipped with powerful computer equipment that analyze and project all sorts of changes on the bowl.
Siemens' leader explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull's bowl except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can shift from virtual reality from simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As a single limitation of this technological development madness, there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its buds in a town 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty have 580 people, including two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 Red Bull, probably, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy beverage brand has put in the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and null fame.
The factory technology manager, Steve Nevey, says five years ago, it could be said that R & D's progress in racing cars was 50% of the win and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive shop in Barcelona in collaboration with his associate Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 businesses between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will register this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain Vice President Helena Herrero gave as an example the renovated shop located on the Gran Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to implement 200 trademarks in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones opened were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one in Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for store deployment will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of exclusive furniture for stores (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe will have the same picture.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trading network claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connected with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bet on 'flying' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's managing director Jaime Guardiola thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it provides for a collapse of the margins of interest, which will try to compensate partly with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years one million private customers, his task to do.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new master plan that will be valid for three years.
The aim, apart from surviving without needing to make use of FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share through the capture of one million new customers - 700,000 if those who can get out of the bank are deducted, its great task to be accomplished, because so far this bank has damaged more SMEs and companies than the particular customer.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or the same thing, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as a goal, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all the plans of the world banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will complete this year its Master Plan Optima, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for an additional fiscal year.
Customers who let their savings banks escape will be their main goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war on liabilities - which penalises margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums paid by banks and cash companies for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving at the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't lock the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincinoDías on November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the banking sector's trend now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will seek larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he assured.
He claims that the capital needs "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fund-raising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it has reduced the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He pointed out that the issue could not be issued, but rather what happened in June, short-term funding could be obtained through rest, thereby mitigating the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the banks
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the Spanish savings bank concentration trial began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they remained for the second phase.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Caisses d'Epargnes (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been realized, it can't be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Cívica Bank group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most have been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 13 or 14, all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Banque d'Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is carried out "at the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the time frame set in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The passage of 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to be in conformity with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain makes is to remember that the deadline must be met before the end of the year".
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that started a process of "very important" concentration and "go as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector drew a good deal from the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin chose to remain in the euro, but it laid down the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of 426 euros of aid to unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, from the management of airports in Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the Lotteries in the state.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to her responsibility for highlighting the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what must be its future, which conflicts with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany begins to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
Second, Mark's recovery, although now it looks like science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, is about 50% of the population.
The third is a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and an extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission encouraged deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (tax rigour plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow in the Central European country was when Merkel had hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
At this point she was strongly criticized, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the publication were against Greece's recovery.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to enable a country to recover and at the same time obliging private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because it rushed the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should be attending the Union reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she doesn't think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date on the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries that break the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare themselves in cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear part of the costs.
Germany tells us that we must follow a strict growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
This is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asked for is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater peace of mind.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity we have given us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard him in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with large companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, we have opened the way to the the thesis that we must put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And one of the possibilities we are looking at is that we cannot exclude the one to abandon an over-burdened monetary zone of less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she warned us.
Sport and law fraud
The russians similar to Alonso and Ramos versus Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
In principle, the bold expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League caused a lot of ink to shed on the anti-sports character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team already won clearly), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will carry out the regulatory penalty during the next game of the dam match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Discipline Committee sanctioned the team's coach José Mourinho with two games and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the football world.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case related is due to the fact that this has been the protagonist of a team of the Real Madrid entity (who in his anthem shows nobility and honor and who, on previous occasions, has sentenced his players to a fine for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode more to his dilated history of his hystrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is expressly prohibited by the rules contradicting the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is a fraud of law with these actions; because they are indeed respectful actions with the sport regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause in the sport spirit.
One of the assets that understands the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, something that has not been jeopardized with these actions, i.e. there has been no violent game.
Another of these assets that we refer to with the right game is to prevent the team from benefiting from the opposing team in an unfair way, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid's players is that it does not suit the normal character of cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in secret to try to avoid punishment, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and willingly accepted the penalty.
Another question is the kind of advantage that offenders gain from the intentional errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that we do not put ourselves in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and we do not gain an advantage in the same match either, because of course the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course the advantage is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players perform a penalty match and pass to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So, gravitating the steps, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sport spirit, which is still part of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of law fraud), otherwise they chose rather the moment when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without playing the penalty or fleeing the penalty.
Although the boundary between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, I think, appears due to two factors: because there were two self-exjections and because of the way in which the directive is to be transmitted to provoke them.
The evil caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to collect Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tour and the lottery, when December arrives also the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ball for the restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincided with the businessmen and associations of the interviewed sector.
To finish complicating accounting, this year's calendar (such as St. Sylvestre's night falls Friday) concentrated the applications on the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the situation is, they all ask for battle prizes, confirm the president of Gremi de Restoracio de Barcelona, Gaità Farres.
The employer's representative is now unable to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to get out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he said.
The case will be "for those who give quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to fall one stage with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
In a survey in various institutions in the centre, there is the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic demand boom for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the environment, with complete formulae of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the particularity of the calendar has assumed more anticipated reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they say.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after having detected an increase in billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate parties in advance.
At their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine manufactured according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the Patronate Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Fun in Barcelona), its Vice-President, Enric Gomà, trusts the possibility of beginning to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that overall bookings are "animated", even though customers "negotiate at most".
True, the hope of holidays has not fallen, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme brings great concern to the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a "faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American Embassy of Pakistan and the Department of State of the United States filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details of the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but they are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
This is how the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report prior to the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under attack Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials including short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and a reason for maintaining custody.
"Pakistan employs staff with strong religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A statement from the Embassy in May, which described communication as "frustrating" with Pakistan, supports the following: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups".
In the hunt of the chef of Wikileaks
Obama will count on a high-ranking counter-terrorism officer to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and track Assange's movements".
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but dated November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents in the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse faced by the Australian in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator lawyer Mark Stephens says "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
The 20 International Police Corps based in Lyon, France, issued Sweden's order on request, but did not make it public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have been indicated to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red call a free route for arrest -- which the national police body must realize -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be located.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, was willing to respond by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained the permit to leave Sweden of his case, compared to the famous Lavrentity Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin security.
"That seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missile denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence -- Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he was not silent.
On Monday he gave indeterminate interviews to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If one can show that she has been responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates that they are warning the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the application as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he said for CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a high-ranking anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the Department of State to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute any person providing contributions or assistance to them".
Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has to come back to his statements after saying that Assange should be "murdered".
"Obama should transform it into an objective and use a crewless plane or something similar."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"He who is in the government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and whatever is not an execution would be too kind punishment," said Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with eyes on the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for solving the internal revolt within ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party's president is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and that it cannot absolutely give him headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eyelashes that allow him to freeze until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by hand.
If the carodists want to send a certain penalty vote to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified by half one more of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod require the president a little more than to make his position available for the militia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the convention for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The leader of the ERC has acknowledged that the "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to make the organization once and for all capable of washing its family room linen.
In this line, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered Puigcercós, the holder of Innovation thought that the leader's ratification of "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of which he pointed out.
The first, to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., to include new figures coming from the eligible carod sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that the liquid ERC once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the holding of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, was an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, who has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 convulsive conclave commissioned the management to revise the assembly model at a specific convention for the reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors to the outpost, the time could be good for taking it back and closing it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO of Mexico State, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November 23 people were executed in Mexico State, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO in Mexico State.
Among the murders are these three women and the discovery of two bodies cut out in the Mexico Valley.
During the previous month of the year 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of firearm and the blow of thanks to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of a vehicle abandoned on the street Mixtecs in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan municipality.
Very early on Thursday morning, on the fourth, the owners of shared land found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots of fire when he left his house to initiate the collection of garbage.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a head shot impact in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the front, a man's body was found on a lonely path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body a shot struck with a 25 caliber firearm was found.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies have carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they have not been found.
Tepotzotlán residents warned about the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorada, the hands attached behind and the eyes banded.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot in the neck.
In the middle of the month the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the city of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, while two death warning messages were discovered with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony we found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th cover, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning they located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, we found the lifeless body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin we found tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with his image.
By the end of the month, a man's dead body was found on the side of a car in the Municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three ball impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with the undercover head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with his hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the San Agustín Colony Justice Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to them; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristle with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of the country in COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the coal footprint and had detailed that he maintained his offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the Sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei ensured that its country has made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and to re-convert its industry.
In fact, he explained that over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy savings targets, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, it stated, there are various multi-year plans in progress or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Effective Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received United Nations (UN) investments, government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another one for the change of filament lamps by savings lamps and another one for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific advisor to the government of that country with regard to climate change, ensured that China's efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he explained that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make it another similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP national leader explained that the former bread leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former bread leader had the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that, in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission d'Ordre de Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to make a complaint to the National Council Order Commission, where appropriate, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he made it clear that it is not time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal," he said.
The bread leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, "we taste it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council would probably be able to elect the best leader that National Action needs for the next three years, so it would give rise "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He planned that the party's revival in the elections of 4 July will be reflected on the next debate, although "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that come from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made ourselves "many hopes for them, and I am sure that Gabino will be up to expectations."
When asked about PRI's criticism against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the prisoners to reflect on the six years of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Groutari.
"If the PRI thinks that the Zedillo y Salinas governments were better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of 'armour," he said.
He stated that the Federal Executive may make expressions such as those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no badge, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter for students without papers
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," tweeted the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today met at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, please call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said Twitter Obama.
Its short message maintains a cyber-link with a wider document that calls on the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the Bush period's tax reductions and government funding were extended.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved by the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The Leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "vote to close the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize students without papers could be voted on from Thursday next in the Senate, even though it would be most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, remained in that country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the project are involved in an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most brokered Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's term of office.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they were not going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree with the fact that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of language pleasure was a walk in which participants spread the narrative
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect of me?" asked the invited writer Luisa Valenzuela to open the second stage of the Language Pleasures, a cycle that celebrates the Spanish literature and this time used the title of his question (while another forum the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the plaie "... put us in a trance", slowly launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young, who had met at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "plaie" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she is convinced: "patience is not my strong, she may be my wound".
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually opened, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighs relieved and concludes: "I could only know that it is actually open and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a fascinating narrative he called "Eloge à l'invention", where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at a given time is discovered.
With touch of magic realism, he spoke of a famous sordid who touched the clouds, turned people who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a story that turns to speak later to America, the great news that had its own chroniclers and quoted at Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the stories of the conquerors.
"Those who invented us all (the writers) have mocked false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that even lacked the powder."
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "the madmen and liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It's thanks to his legacy that we're talking about."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table He owes it to the plaie.
The Cuban-Portuguese has placed itself on the great scourge of social violence that its country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that the good literature, the good poetry the good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premature," she said, after quoting that the reality of the literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "this must be on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "late every assertion there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times putting our finger on the plague and bothering people who feel very comfortable thinking about cartoons, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting people to regain the sense of writing.
Romano in the hunting of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, which find among them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series, even though he has so far not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentinian finally consoled himself with the underchampion medal, remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The holyist strategy arrived at its first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament when it held the reins of Morelia with which it lost with a overall result of 4-2 versus Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure it also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournoi Bicentenaire 2010, again against the Devils, Rubén again suffered a reverse, because his team made a 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his opponent at the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same fate, he tries to separate himself from the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the headline when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can hold back is that until the referee whistles the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to shoot us we were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we cannot celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we just have to prepare, the previous tournament has been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or anxiety to hold the title in our hands, he has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we will not get back in that situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a subchampion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
People must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011 the visa processing procedure at the Embassy and Consulates of the United States will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview with the Consular Section.
CSA staff will receive the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will bring some benefits to the aspirants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, there will no longer be a need to make a payment for an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The bidder will make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visas will not have to engage in an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only introduce themselves to the nearest AUC where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CSA, applicants who wish a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, please visit http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of alien life
The United States Space Agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, science studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that we thought was too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
Anyway, the creature uses the arsenic as a way of living and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of discoveries at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will participate in the geobiology Pamela Conrad, which studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the biggest satellite in Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and Opposing Block Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Congress Act, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th was just settled when the Congress appeared to be an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of the 'bipartistry' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, de PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, de PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonn' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, did they repeat, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Director chaired by the PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms institutionally, we constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme from political will and if they do not, they would be served again by the two parties and thus the opposite coalition will end.
"So far as this has happened (the opposite coalition), this is what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot afford, he went on, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"This is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartisanism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to increase their numbers, the Convergent has abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, by PT, explained that now the Congress has turned into a 'butin' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patron Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the MP, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"Let's not leave them with cupular agreements outside the 5th Congress that will probably be Members, now with the five Members we see, separated in different fractions, we decided to join in order to find a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform that they did, that they decided, we're outside and we don't agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán City Hall pays another check to the interrogated owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the mayorate.
With it, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the Municipal Transparency Page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of account suppliers".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what he owes, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "repaired" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the latter on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25, Northwest had published a review of the cheques issued by the City Council to its suppliers, revealing that in the period of March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a crossroads of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourism sector of Mazatlán has asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Dorada Zone Trades, recalled that they have repeatedly demanded that the image of the destination be taken care of and new activities should replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists have come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid close trades.
"Politics only know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune we lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without adequate planning."
Host José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Mayor.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so, so through a preventive interview and not only doing the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live in it and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it is not only dependent on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given them the attention that is needed and this kind of fact emphasizes something that is known to all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that need to get in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Herourly Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned up and put on line to make them attractive to add them to the inventory we have to make the promotion of this destination."
IP requests results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges facing them.
Mazatlán's business sector calls for a dignified and free labour legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsing and facing major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was set up by seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are clean and committed to management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges facing them.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties because the custom is that they make covenants to secure their own interests and they become a carnival mask for governors and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certify their commitment to establish the necessary bridges for the current Governor to make progress.
"We will ensure that they are doing a decent job and especially committed to society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their confidence vote in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, has considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they grow economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance of the Government budget in order to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is inconsistent as an important economic activity that generates currency and investment and competes directly with agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources need to be classified into detonating tourism projects that help to give certainty to the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation has not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a magician king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their homes are formed by neither more nor less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo long aspires to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothes of size for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I said to him, 'We'll see my son', because he was very dear', they remember with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, shoes the size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, shoes the size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, shoes the size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream come true of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the Encherche Roi Mage campaign, giving a toy or money at the reception of Northwest.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and will face various charges.
The search took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschich, money and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
Arrested persons were to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession with the aim of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to carry out these arrests," said Mr.Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Regie participated in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservative Bill that, according to the Government, should address the problem of ships carrying clandestine migrants is obviously being fought while the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they cannot support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would hold up to one year any person from a vessel identified as a carrier of illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Chief of Bloc québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because he took the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticisms of his party's party about illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative Bill because it takes refugees and imprisons children for at least one year," explained Ms. Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians say massively to Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a clown."
"They expect Canada to take strong action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections in spite of its rejection.
However, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each member of Parliament who would oppose would then explain himself to his electors.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil argued that this idea did not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January.
Metropole has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Nor was it necessary for the Pakistani public security critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a brick solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil replied to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it, just say it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"More Mr. Charest refuses not to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give the Auditor General a special mandate to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent scout is not the only project in the Charest government cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments to this file.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which hit motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adequate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
High-supervised rivers
Several watercourses remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has been in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slide would have taken place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell over several regions, ranging from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
More than 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
The areas north of the river and the Outaouai Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of total rain.
As these precipitations must be added to the source of the already accumulated snow in some sectors, there are fears that several streams of water will overflow.
Warnings of flood alert were issued Wednesday night by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in St.Jerôme, in the Laurentides, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood watch and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall led to the overflow of certain lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated on a preventive basis.
In Outaouais, the overrun of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-and-Pontefract.
Civil security remains on the alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, Security Counsellor.
On Wednesday, Quebec's Crusader Forecast Centre has issued warnings of strong crusae for several rivers, including Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partially Blamed Dupont
The Radio Animater of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has undergone a partial reversal before the Canadian Council of Radiotelevision Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its crude language in waves.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI team 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and the coarse language which did not suit the broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CNRC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Quebec Common Front of Social Assistance.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the broadcast were incorrect.
Animators need to provide solid information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, animated Stéphane Dupont found that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
The majority of members of the Committee concluded that the vehicle message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont the noon" addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame has therefore been taken for it.
The last dispute focused on statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then turned to a media face-to-face that had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI entertainer said he had not made any donations to help Haitians because we could not know with certainty that people in need would really receive money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the host.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of vulgar language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during hours of wide listening within three days.
A King of the kung-fu in Montreal
The Montrealers of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and boxing Thai climbs on the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve with professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for some combat everywhere, since for those who don't like the game on the ground present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and as commission for the UPS has just issued bad news to its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur World Championship (WKA) from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the category full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing, he explained."
"Now I'm getting ready to go to China for the San Shu World Cup."
"The fighters who finished out of the first four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the fifth tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've progressed to every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punching and kicking, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
The duels are originally held on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has to hold only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most noted and most prestigious in China, explained the sympathetic Gaillard."
"It's a bit the equivalent of Limpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, half-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face their category in the final."
"Then the winners of each category face to crown one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor companies, which has obtained the most important, that of project management, for an amount of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called Energy Management, was formed in 2004 in a manner consistent with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Management Consortium found the lucrative contract without any public tenders.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"It's the new way of collusion and defeating competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it in an open way," said Pakistani MP Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he was hard to see how the public could be used in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau replied in the afternoon, denying forcefully that there was a collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she insisted, claiming that the QP had been "bad" and had "lacked rigour."
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a limited alliance over time that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The construction site is in progress and is due to be phased up to 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiation.
Therefore, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devour, the consortium formula in the engineering council sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of Quebec's business register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortiums, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back one and the same moral person, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory has responded to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a special way since the 1970s."
The major boss of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project's management contract was granted on a voluntary basis.
"If you go on calls for bids and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the competence of people," said Mr.Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consulting contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has increased 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting his participation in Energy management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Administration contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known in the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau let it come to the conclusion that the PQ is also linked to those companies that "finance" him, before stating that he was rather his leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - Green label inspires no confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair brands and eco-certifications to guide his choices.
Pis, even if he bathes in a media universe where messages for more responsible consumption pull, he deplores a lack of credible information, lack that he even qualifies as a brake on his commitment, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, the first reading of which was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, however, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University Consumer Observatory.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be co-responsible, indicates the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' speech on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, responsible consumer information seems to be crucial to boosting this consumption bread currently animated by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the vacuum and the doubtful nature of the information would calm the burning of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
On the other hand, one third of Quebecers are equally suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that they seek to get into their hands.
On another note, consumers were about half in 2010 to change their habit and above all to change the brand of one or more products to meet their convictions.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from traders in their neighbourhoods and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumer index has reached 64 out of 100 for this year - the Homo consumer of Quebec likes to appear as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used common transport or recommended co-vehicles to defend their green interests.
The walk and bike were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just taken its first click.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who was asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but with only one loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallele, who hoped for a grant of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy to Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving him his full cinematic vocation, do not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to involve itself in the file, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources of state offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been reviewed downwards.
A proposal and action plan was sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris file.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the firm reached the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to answer.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the State's gift must really be dismissed.
Let's remember that the Québec Film and Cinemas Owners' Association was opposed to a direct investment by the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which he did not do for other cinemas.
However, a number of stakeholders in the community, on the contrary, called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, held the author's cinema in his complex premises for ten years after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films was screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to trust his clientele.
The Société Angus and the Parallele, with their head Christian Yaccarini, piloting a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the wheel of acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallele, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February next by projecting the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Duty and we don't know what he and his group think of lower proposals that are made to them.
The sail up on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables divulged by WikiLeaks raise the veil on what the United States considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians towards the Americans, but at the same time betray their sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to get under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, either in the middle of a federal electoral campaign, reports how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations to this situation.
"A nearly inherent Canadian inferiority complex may be conditional upon Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life rather than bringing this election to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it".
The ambassador understands all the less this "surgent silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
" Logically, does he think that the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going to vote."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the early February confidence vote on the federal budget, by which Canada will display its first deficit in more than a decade due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast at CBC refer back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O emissions, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the removals for the CIA's muscular interrogations.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim from Canada."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we note that spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
Mike Huckabee echoed in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday in Cancún, the United Nations proposed a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (GES) which corresponds to nearly one third of the additional reduction to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding commitments to reduce by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emitted on the planet to enlighten humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, large issuer countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to move global GHG emissions from 53 GT to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract another 5 Gt balance in order to stabilize by 2020 the increase in climate at 2 degrees to avoid it becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, produced by light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, this need for energy is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10 000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the United Nations study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats as well as very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have posted reservations for fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and they need to be eliminated as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place requirements.
But the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluocompact bulb, but rather coal thermal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce spent electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it $2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire awaits in nervousness the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the interim results without further delay," said a spokesperson to the United Nations Chief.
"He calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission left the deadline for Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday poll.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the president of the CIS had stated on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied Wednesday worldwide so that the IEC finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudive" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the campaign of intimidation of voters practiced by the NFs in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the President leaving to vote.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are held by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northman who denies any connection with the former rebels, has judged "unacceptable" the delay in announcing the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go until he claimed victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and complains before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (IDB) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan areas (9.7% by counting overseas departments), showing the adjusted data of provisional seasonal variations (SVCs) published Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the population in metropolitan areas and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over one year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has still deteriorated, with a further increase in unemployment rate, to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 point over three months, +0.5 point over one year) and 25% including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed as part of the ILO.
For their part, seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points over three months as well as over one year), 482,000 people aged 50 or older, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of age have experienced unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini examined and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, head of waste treatment companies and brother of P.S. President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and collapsed at the Luynes arrest house, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guerini was examined for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, repression, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and tends to explain all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's another thing to prove them," said AFP's lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the PS's strong man in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, had, through his lawyers, to pass on to the judge before his hearing a memo to explain himself.
One of his close friends, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined Wednesday night and collapsed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but run the discharges he had to handle.
As for the allocation of markets or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never had any knowledge of them, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was examined on Wednesday for the diversion of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on encountering the protagonists of the file.
"My client has been able to provide explanations of the facts that are brought against him."
"The instructor's magistrate has taken it into account by not depriving him of freedom," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday night at Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for the Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is continued for "traffic of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being examined one for "substracting and diversion of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicated diversion of public funds".
Finally, Alexander Guerini's companion Jeannie Peretti was examined for "abuse of social property".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Giard, recently killed in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect their companies that they have served to whitewash money from big banditry.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several judicial information open against X in April 2009 as a result of anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public procurement, particularly in the waste chain.
In particular, the investigation focuses on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne as well as some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spinning", held the opinion in ahaleine in France, put diplomacy on the alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything in the eyes of the diplomats of the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going up to give them advice for the treatment of their own "hate" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not had the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place in a raw light the way in which the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
Elysée's strategic affairs adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is meeting with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to return their own nationals forced into Iran.
"Be made of sound," they say, "throw into the media the words "rights of the fundamental man", "innocency", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more so that the Iranians ask you not to."
For, when attempts to discuss through discreet channels were made, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians were "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail".
He announces that Clotilde Reiss prison release (which will take place on 16 August, on the day she takes refuge at the French Embassy) "will require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros of bail).
And it reveals that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future stop another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains locked up in Iran.
Information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose US claims extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The American Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is behind Iranian clandestine networks in the acquisition of nuclear equipment, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a trade?
The release of Iran from the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier made sure that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he said, has not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but has sought to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the guard of seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision", he observed.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
Elysée's advisor makes up a phone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elysée does not carry out its efforts, through press releases and "outbreaks" organized in the media, to suggest that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that manipulation bears its fruits as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media blitz" of French officials.
On what is the basis of so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the Embassy in Paris is asked.
"Although their statements are full of praise, French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then looks at the reasons why the Elysée had to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggering the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows it's a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"That should at least cause confusion in the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it to Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the release of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a "Cendrillon" law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under 16 years of age, have reported representatives of the Ministries of Culture and the Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and the right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental officer responsible for the bill.
The online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the enforcement of the law, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit their daily access time to these games for young people whose parents are applying for them, the manager added.
It will also make available to people who demand free software to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, compared to 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designates the organizing countries
In the wake of suspicions of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee designates Thursday the World Cup Organizing Countries 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying may take steps on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Fifa queen competition will take place in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's Emir, Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measurement of the economic and political issues of a World Cup.
Backstage treatments are therefore likely to last for the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the Fifa assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations resulting in the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temari and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that only once hosted the World Cup in 1966.
The BBC gave up a layer on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to displease Fifa and embarrass the English leaders, who have embarked on an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the successful coup of his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 obtained the organization of the JO-2012 in London.
Will this intense activity suffice to re-worship the British flag to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack any assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could daunt their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, becoming an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its file (city, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "a unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a mere veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appeared as the logical favorites.
The first world economic power, the seat of Fifa's main sponsors, seems to have a long run on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the World-2026 to China, which the Fifa would desire, would in fact bring down Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which came out of the big game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certain ones.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (due to the time shift) by European countries, the war on Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not had the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than them.
One mandate to Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence is not a good household with the part of a mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then we have to act as if doubt still existed.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even if not believed, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "someone takes part in the fall of 2011".
Let him mention in front of UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening in Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sown a bit of fever.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way off.
The President simply pointed out that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five years to two.
He made a note, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the president, on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"To the worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His previous remarks do not make him more candidate than the previous day; they do not make him less.
If they give comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the PS candidacy race, on the one hand.
But this isn't the Segolène Royal high school that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to unveil himself.
On the contrary, it is because his application in 2012 is clear that many of the PS are calling for an early battle order.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer François Filon's candidacy to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP above", immediately and prudently reacted to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of State securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for the exit of the crisis or, at least, to announce the closure of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that must be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt requires, the Frankfurt issuing institute will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory as it is to worsen a situation than it is today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the state debt crisis in Europe.
She did not wish to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...)".
On the previous day in Brussels, at its hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more dissert as to his intentions, simply saying that the programme of purchasing State securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main governing rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historic level since May 2009.
In fact, Treasury bond purchases by the ECB doubled last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the anticipated continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists do not expect any significant change either.
If lending operations at more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she changes her program in a significant way."
" otherwise it would be to take the risk of causing new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to its interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to encourage an Atone Market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign euro area debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is necessary to replace the lack of investors in the market at any cost and to act in such a way as to prevent the packaging of the returns paid by the most fragile states," a major mandatory manager said yesterday.
For if interest rates evolve, States will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, or stabilize it.
The safeguard of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government turns round
After a worrisome start of the week for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday, with the reflux of compulsory rates at 10 years.
A return to the precarious calm.
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the presidents of the region said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "unbreakable" and expect a "unforeseen" weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had fluctuated at 263 points, leading to a certain influx in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared himself "strongly concerned" by "the turbulence of the markets" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she is like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the tone of tax revenues that goes with, making the state at risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate is about 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget group that could be set up after the parties, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," says Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," says Arigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, neither in the short nor in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are less than those requested in other countries," said Pier Carlo Paduan, a leading OECD economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
It would then open up a period which would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde again hammered it yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe, have still demonstrated it on Sundays and at nights, are of course solid, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European State bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we can't talk about a start of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's notation agency announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which particularly weighs on banking systems," said economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and its dangers, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also for the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings of the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market picker (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a round in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the extreme-eastern investors of the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first EDF securities issues are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative told Reuters agency that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries which are on the front line, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are in addition to more effective austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both are at any cost to avoid asking for international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that are necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors look at the options available to accelerate the process of standardisation of sovereign bonds markets.
By way of passage to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first advance of the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand it over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading actor in the European sovereign debt market, feel that a stretch of about 100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with up to now EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions were to worsen.
Neige et verglas: 24 departments en vigante orange
The snowy episodes still create traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now under orange supervision due to the risk of snow and ice.
Eure, Eure and Loir, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna, joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and the Charentes and it is weakly snowing on Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are remarkable enough to create traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, predicts Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several department departments were banned from heavy weights of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes that recommend taking his vehicle only if necessary and the circulation of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy weights.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% to Orly due to future snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France has been on its way to full, the billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro must be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then enable the GSP to borrow part of the financing of its double loop on the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Amending Finance Act 2010, which was considered in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special capital tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is numbered: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a realignment of a tax on offices that already exist "in order to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Grand Paris Society".
How much would that report?
Mystery.
It is not numbered in the text.
We're far from four billion.
"It is stated that these tax resources are added to the €4 billion of the capital allocation that will be mobilised by the state and brought to the Society of the Grand Paris as a measure of the project", it can be read in the explanatory statement.
At the SGP, we don't find this system shocking.
"From the time of the creation of revenue (the two taxes, ndlr), one can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion afterwards, it is explained."
"This will be included in the budget and taken into account."
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised are still for absentee subscribers, is likely to trigger a somewhat agitated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers revengers and spies in due course
WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears only as a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" U.S. revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's caricature sinister profile was for a long time for skitch cabaret artists.
The rule that secret records should be composed only new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (he doesn't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who go to occultism believe only in what they already know, and who confirms what they have already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Same for secret files.
The informer is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the chief of secret services (unless it could be, I know, editor at Libération), which retains only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as the newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since Heads of State can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have become centres of espionage.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it's only through hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy under bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the state department.
So the scandal does not put as many victims as the "burreaux" in crisis.
But let us come to the deep nature of what has happened.
So, in Orwell's time, we could conceive all power like a Big Brother who was controlling every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy has been fully proven since, in order to control each movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the borrowed highway and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the power eye.
But when it is demonstrated, as now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the revenger of the citizen - may know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means taking all power away from him.
WikiLeaks did nothing wrong with Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this highly powerful injury?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put on-line any information reserved - that would be published on a poster stuck around the street.
But it is as obvious as with current technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential relationships by telephone.
Nothing easier than discovering whether and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that for the moment, my forecast is science fiction and is therefore Romanesque, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who travel discreetly in diligence to uncontrollable itineraries, bearing only messages learned by heart or, at the very least, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in key closed drawers: at the bottom, Watergate's spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now advanced in crabs, that is to say back.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized the communications, the Internet restored a wire telegraph (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogics) had enabled cinema researchers to explore a step-by-step film, going forward and backwards and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (numerics) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroporations.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, and the travels it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that communication policy and techniques return to the horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was being done in the secret of the embassies.
The embassies are now requesting confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France Bidouille Promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review compliance with the fast-disbursed financing promises (such fast-start or early funding) made by developed countries.
And the big French biduillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU came out of the great game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, brochure distribution...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated for its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same level of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010 €2.2 billion has been released, which puts it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose proceedings have been blocked by France.
Today, each one chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years to fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" of the year 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or to the overall level of Public Development Assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element, the distribution between gifts and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that €1 lent is equal to €1 given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission mitigation based on more efficient technologies), it is not possible to present a euro that will be recovered as an equivalent to a euro given... At the very least, it should be counted on under its commitments only the cost of the loan for the lender country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France only makes such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts €1 to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass-and-pass tour!
In short, in its fast start funding, France operates a double fraud: on the one hand on the evolution of action over time and on the other on the reality of financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, she can claim that she spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has achieved arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it was enough to lend?) and in the negotiations as developing countries are not completely of the...
The chapter on early funding is only a relatively short-term issue in relation to all climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year's early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of compliance with its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be of a nature to increase the level of international confidence needed to advance in the discussions.
Warning to child-ingested pesticides
A 10-year-old child becomes pregnant on one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday from the Association Generations Futures (former Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which predicts that its results "have no significant statistical value in relation to the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", bought food generally consumed in four meals and one in a day by a child of a dozen years in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as chills, have been examined by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogenics and five substances classified as carcinogenics, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as certain carcinogenics as well as about 20 residues likely to disrupt the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided for as a sample by the study, presents traces of six chemical substances, of which a fungicide is still prohibited in France.
Same thing for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, tin in box, and even bread wand and chewing gum were truffled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is "probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Greens (EE-LV), on the other hand, proposed "to address the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
