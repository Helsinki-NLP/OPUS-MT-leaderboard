The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned "to be taken by monks"
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM, for the suggestion that they should change their name by MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate has emerged for the plans to change the name of the assembly by the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama are afraid of being ridiculed.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name "remains with Twp and Pwp."
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "pwp" and "pwp" means "cass".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the group's set "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the change of name, but stressed that from MWP to Muppet there is only one little verbal leap.
In this context, the Welsh word "w" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed a great deal of support for the designation Parliament of Wales.
On the issue of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of Parliament Wales or WMP, but MWP's option received most support in a public consultation.
The AM seems to be suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to achieve consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from which he is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the AM's disability rules and the design of the committee's system.
The AM will get the final vote on what should be called when the legislation is debated.
Macedonians join referendum polls to change their country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to the "North Macedonia Republic."
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that has lasted for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a complaint from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the referendum defenders, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the name change is no longer the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent while Harlem's churches are still fighting
"The elders to whom I spoke said that before there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither one thing nor the other."
He said he could understand that the bars were gone.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to."
As for the churches, fear that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they will return where they started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities full of kind of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain shrines.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation changed in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took place with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott at 125th Street stores, a Harlem street that had resisted hiring and climbing black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's frigates made plans to rebuild it, they charged the trolloon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the carillon as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played carillone in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also highlighted that it was the first closet in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the largest charillon in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have occupied St. Martin for the last few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The Parish junta, the body that governs the parish and is made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "will impact costs" on the board, although the latter had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some Frequents complained of the diocese's lack of transparency.
A shark strikes a boy while fishing lobsters in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was fishing for lobsters in California on the first day of that crustacean's season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that it took about half an hour to dive with friends on Saturday morning when he listened to the boy asking for help with screams, when he was born with a group of people to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only exciting to catch a lobster, but then he noticed that he was screaming "I've been worked!
I've been worked for!'
Hammel said he noticed when the boy got here.
"I screamed to everyone who came out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was moved on a helicopter to Rady's child hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press round that they had divided a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined that it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
The officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most of them do not consider themselves dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty corridors similar to the large stores full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion into the UK beauty market, which amounts to Â£2.800 million and which continues to grow as fashionable sales and home products fall, the biggest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 tents across the country, and then they will pass to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty is taking place at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill up the shelves that day occupied TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those you can see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique make-up so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
Besides, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will prove concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, in southern London last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that establishments will increasingly look like malls, because supermarket chains try to compete with discount shops like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced sales points of Argos and Habitat into hundreds of shops, since it bought both chains two years ago. By the way, this has reinforced the sales of edibles and made the purchases profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but partnership came to an end after a dispute about how to share drug revenue in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business formed by 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transform the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff that you can turn to for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "furiously" after Holly Willoughby retired from business of 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, left "furicious" after television host Holly Willoughby had retired from an 11 million-pound business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of household clothes and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrew.
This Morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones sparking off his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "furiously" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at Â£1.5 million, meant that she had no time to dedicate to the brand of household clothes and accessories of both, Truly.
The business came to compare itself with Goop, Gwyneth Patrow's brand, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at Â£11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby went to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was different from one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left astonished all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this Morning's presenter is among Britain's most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, because of the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and textiles to the home, and that could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
Couples were on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter in the ITV I'm program to Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "We shouldn't comment on their business."
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He's had the criticisms that he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not a president's own" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said by putting on his voice as a newscaster.
"I have not yielded anything."
He signaled that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization have been halted.
More than three pesas after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, reported to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the United States to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he highlighted that the United States continues to impose sanctions directed at further exerting pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his rallying speech.
"Things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve Kim's relationships had positive results: ending the missile tests, helping free the hostages and returning the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we'd have about 200 people standing here," said Trump pointing at the crowd that had just ahead.
An earthquake and tsunami devastated an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they would not ask for international help, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutope, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, has ensured that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation at Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the constant earthquake in Indonesia, the country is extremely ill-equipped to deal with the anger of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis were built in Aceh, it's not common to find them on other shores.
Even though a warning had been issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling among many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been highlighted in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around the improvement of Indonesia's damaged infrastructure, and made money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds in the final line at the re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a way of living the more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the draw goal for Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal at minute 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 meters from Chelsea's port with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball with his left leg before he shot the second stick.
The ball circled over the area as it moved toward the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling over an Arrizabalaga Kepa that was jumping into the air and entering the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position, organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as long as possible, so I tried to win as long as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came up to Kante and I said a touch without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 at rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard had scored at minute 25.
The front of the Blues passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before he turned near the middle of the change and ran into the field of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful pass in depth leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up in the second pole with a left shot that Alisson Becker couldn't stop.
Liverpool faces Naples at the championship group stage League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do its own thing with Videoton in UEFA Europe League Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of fatal victims of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and in the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832, according to the national disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped among the rubble of the buildings that came down with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, as indicated in a press round by the agency's spokesman Sutope Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman had been stabbed to death
A murder investigation opened after a woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gun wounds on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area to see or hear something from that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is at its early stage, but I'd like to make a call to contact us any one who was near John Street at Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I'd also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything from the camera of the control panel to contact us, as they might have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a neighbour of Birkenhead and that it was found inside a property.
This evening, friends who believed to meet the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they're in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what had happened.
Residents just know they can't get back in a few hours.
A police officer has been heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
A woman crying appears on the scene.
Not to mention 'it's awful'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cord watching the block of apartments.
To anyone with information, ask you to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers in phone number 0800 555 111 citing record 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewrite history"
Their prohibition would be poetic justice for their Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by their fanatic and Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society has qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "strike" and "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace became a goal.
The iconoclasty of British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed Cromwell for his predecessor Thomas' actions in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion that existed in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to be still meriting tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith declared to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not that is a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the 17th century mid-century conflict has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a side of division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A pig killer crushes a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a Southwestern China market.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the nickname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered with blood near a courtroom in the Liupanshui market, in Guizhou province.
A piggrower is prepared to put the pigs' vaccines in a stable on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently she traveled with her cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him another adjacent court.
He said there was a big male with blood in his mouth in the courtroom.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he killed him.
"My cousin had his legs bloody and smashed," declared the cousin, named "Wu", to Guiyang Evening News.
Recording the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police had gathered evidence on the scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Even though they're not very common, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-kilometer pig rushed a Welsh farmer against the tractor until he arrived at his wife and frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs don't usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "sparing."
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect," he said.
The remnants of the Rosa hurricane will bring strong, widespread rains to the southwest of the United States.
Forecasts indicate that the Rosa hurricane weakens as it passes over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will take torrential rains north of Mexico and southwest of the United States for the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, east, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to advance north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a wave begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and to move east, towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity toward the north, which will penetrate the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the wave will create abundant and widespread rains in the southwest in the next few days.
At the local level, the rainfall of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The great tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in timely areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially on a large part of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden floods with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We strongly recommend adventure in the desert under tropical rain threat.
The heavy rains could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and the thunderstorms would bring locally torn and dusty winds.
The fence will bring local heavy rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
The total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause the flow of smaller debris and slippery roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet station in the region.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and the first hours of Monday, before the rain spreads at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The abundant rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness great temperature fluctuations in the US due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes involves major temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic differences in temperature in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country a warm October start is expected, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows high probability of temperatures above average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the trial in Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual schedule for a new last-minute Friday: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona, Jeff Flake, for the FBI to conduct an investigation into a week's charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it's 100 percent safe that Kavanaugh played them while he was drunk and tried to take his clothes off at a party in high school.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was totally certain that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that over 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other strings that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To get an idea, it's like an audience like a football end or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, who largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement indicating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, it was captured by chambers of the CNN and the CBS on Friday morning being stabbed by protesters while trying to enter an elevator on the way to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He looked low for several minutes while he was being rebuked, TVned live on CNN.
"I'm here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
They said, "You have power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said that his office made a statement, before the elevator was closed, he added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable channels broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment before the full Senate to submit the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI were investigating the allegations against the nominee next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations she had with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the tariffs on the other side was "totally absurd."
Wayde Sims murdered: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect from shooting the lives of Wayde Sims, a 20-year basketball player at LSU (State University of Louisiana).
According to Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder.
The officers broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the scene and claimed that they contained Simpson's DNA, according to reports CBS affiliate channel WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said they admitted to being the perpetrator of the shot that killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he had a bail of $350,000.
The Office of the Forensics of the Eastern Baton Rouge parish issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the refugee unit of the state police in Louisiana, the state police criminalist workshop, the Southern University police are the neighbours for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked local law enforcement for his "delicency and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01-year-old was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball trainer, Will Wade, declared that the team was "thrown down" and "s Thrilled" by Wayde's death.
"This is what concerns us all the time," Wade said.
Volcano skyscraper about Mexico City
The ashes that throw the Popocatepetl volcano came to the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano on Saturday after they had detected crater activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several thunders and tremors.
The images of social networks showed thin layers of gray in the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
The geophysicals detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southwest of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 had shaken the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflict between the police and the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after Pro-Independence protesters faced the riot police and while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the Catalonian secession.
A group of masked proseparatists contained in the antidisturbing police threw eggs at them and painted in powder that created dark dust clouds in the streets that tend to be full of tourists.
There were also subsequent colds that same day with the police, who used the poops to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independentist groups that co-created "Ni oblivion or forgiveness", faced unionist protesters who shouted "Long Life to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for mild wounds received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues the flower of skin in the independence region one year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters have opted a great deal for independence, although participation has been low and the opposite of secession has boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place equally, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who came to the independentist demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had hope that Catalonia would achieve independence.
Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I've seen my parents cry for joy when they can vote, but now we're all set," he said.
Despite gaining an adjusted victory, though decisive, in the regional elections of last December, this year the Catalan pro-independentist parties fought to maintain the momentum, with many of their leaders most known in self-imposed exile or detained in waiting for trial for their participation in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his cell phone, said the conflict had been fueled by the politicians of both sides.
"Every time there's more tension," she said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that the following year would be presented for election to the European Parliament.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: They arrest a man after a car shot at a house
three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car had shot several times against a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred at Ballenagaard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings declared the grid and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible that a beast against the car might have been fired at some point.
The Menga goal gives Livingston the 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The ascendant Livingston surprised the Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Hebox club.
The goal of Dolly Menga was decisive for Gary Holt's team to go up a level and put it after Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year at the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, Hearts, from which they separate eight points.
But first the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to be invincible in division by sixth consecutive party; the main coach, Holt, still doesn't know the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler with me.
Livingston escapes opportunities from weakened visitors
Holt's team must have moved ahead long before the moment they scored, because with their control they caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but his cross-fire did not cross the threshold of the door; then Alan Lithgow's shot went out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the door.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger the visitors in the ball games.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
Rangers granted a free shot and Livingston made a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix the Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated possession, but he was confronted with an impenetrable defense that prevented much work from the Liam Kelly ranger.
That pattern went on in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Ranger's waitress, Allan McGregor took a shot at Scott Pittman with his weight, and Lithgow threw the ball out in another play at Livingston's stopped ball.
Many crossings were made in the Livingston area which were continuously cleared, while two criminal applications were refused: one by hand and one by one by Halkett's entrance to replacement Glenn Middleton.
Livingston's 'feminomenal': analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
And unanimously, they were excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their ascending trajectory.
His game style and players have hardly changed since he returned to the top category, but part of the merit is Holt by the way he pushed the computer since he arrived.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, gave superbly a perfectly organized defense while Menga didn't give them a breath throughout the party to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers have failed inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's orders, on this occasion they did not achieve that level.
They failed the last pass, they only managed to penetrate the host team once, all of a long-term call to Rangers, which is found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which aims to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many matters, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters approached to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when colliding with a car
A cyclist passed away in a collision where he saw a car wrapped in London.
The accident took place near the crossing between the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a street passed by from Deptford, in the south-east of the city, around 10:15 a.m. (winter time in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies on a runaway runoff on Childers Street a little over a mile from Saturday's accident.
The metropolitan police stated that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers are injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security prison riot, according to the prison officer.
The disturbance started at HMP Long Lartin Worcestershire around 09:30 (on Sunday summer time in Britain) and still continues.
A "Tournado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which eight prisoners are involved that are contained in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for mild injuries on their faces.
A spokesperson from the prison service said: "The staff of specially trained prisons have been released to deal with a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between bars."
HMP Long Lartin is home to over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was known that the warden of the penitentiary had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot officers had to go to jail to calm down a riot where the staff was attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by drought could benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it is very likely that it will occur early next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane passes through the Southeast Desert leaving chance of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and to arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service reported in a Twitter post that only ten tropical cyclones had maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-kilometer Phoenix radio since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that stretched on a 64-kilometre radius of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service provide 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 on the edge of Arizona MogollÃ³n.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, such as Central Rocky and Great Conca, could reach up to 25 or 50 litres, with total possible isolated areas of 100 l/m2.
For those who are in danger of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing, for the region is very affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the US Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second largest category," reported weather.com.
First, hurricane Rosa will hit the ground on the low California Mexican peninsula.
Rosa, who will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, winding a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north to 19 km/h.
The storm is running cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason it is expected that it will touch the ground in Mexico with tropical storm force in the evening or the night of Monday.
It could rain very heavily in some parts of Mexico, assuming an important flood risk.
"The total rainfall of between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora is expected, and it is possible to meet up to 250 l/m2," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and will then continue to climb through Arizona and enter the south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of the sound is the heavy precipitation in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the South-West US Desert," the National Furacans Center reported.
These rains are expected to cause sudden streams of water and streams of debris in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder so that they found a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 04:00 (winter time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains stable.
According to Somerset police, during the night they were arrested in the Radstock area three boys 17, 18 and 20 respectively.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a record on the cell phone of the event.
Trump states that Kavanaugh âsuffered the pettyity and angerâ of the Democratic Party
"Voteing by Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in a rally at Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh "suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he denied categorically and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had assaulted her sexually decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified in the trial about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that day the "Americans" were witnesses to Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with an impotent public service record," he said addressing the crowd of admirers of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of Republican results in the elections of half a term.
"It's been five weeks for some of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't have to, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats' mission is to "oppose and hinder."
It is hoped that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place before Friday, as CNN indicated by the Republican Party's assistant.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami causes hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke into the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke down to the luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything at their pace.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"Yesterday when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and didn't run away immediately, so they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a prison round in Jacarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trunks, house, dragged everything he found," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the shore.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
They evacuated around 16,700 people to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs disseminated by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many tents and destroyed buildings, broken and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the end of a long, narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantious" and said thousands of homes, shopping centers and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Doganga and which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "totally paralyzed and there's no information" from Domanga, he added Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross reported in a communiquÃ©, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived the moment the warning was issued.
In a shared amateur recording on social networks, you can hear a man sitting on the top floor of a building screaming frantically warning the people who were on the street about the arrival of a tsunami.
Within minutes the water hits the shore by carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an important shutdown that caused the cutting of communications across the Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already started sending cargo aircraft from Jacarta and other cities, but those evacuated continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the evacuation centers of Palu on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami victim balance exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that World Vision personnel went through to reach the city of Palu, where employees looked back in canvas shelters raised in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba commented.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of starting assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing them from travelling to Palu to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staff from abroad can only flow if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster on the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, an Indonesian Red Cross spokesman.
"As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open ourselves to international aid, but it's not yet here."
When the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Fridays, relatives and friends of the disappeared believed that their loved ones were one of the miracles that lifted the depressing argument of natural disasters."
On Saturday they pulled out a boy from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandage added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were their students.
"As a very experienced person in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon related how, in the hours following the spread of news of the Roa Roa hotel's overthrow among the parapentist community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival
However, messages showed only one gray mark instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he added.
They stole $26,750 while charging a cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker charging a cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
In the press release, researcher officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a drawer in the leisure complex and prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole him a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the scene, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, please contact the Newport police by calling 859-292-3680.
The kidnapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye
The kidnapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The Being formerly known as Kanye West."
For some time now, 41-year-old West has been known as Ye's nickname, which he used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred before it appeared on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled his assistance with "emotional motives", according to the programme creator.
Besides being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had already explained earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," said West that same year as he was talking about his record with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous rapists who changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers it to be called Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, also caught up in the script and took off the script and using capital letters.
AMLO undertakes not to use military forces against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, has committed not to use the military force against civilians again when the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students is approaching.
LÃ³pez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he "would never use the military again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
LÃ³pez Obrador promised to support the Mexican youth by giving monthly help to the boys who study and open more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drags boys to the crime gangs.
The US should double its investment in I.A.
According to AI investor Kai-Fu Lee, former Google, Microsoft and Apple, USA should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government had made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lack a formal strategy about AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be the number 1 innovation in AI in 2030.
"Dupplicating the research budget at AI would be a good start, since the other countries are far behind the US, and we're looking for the next great advance at AI," said Lee.
Double funding could double the probability that the next achievement in AI if it was done in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is general director of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player with a higher score and later he was executive in Microsoft Research at the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology contests such as the Robotic Reterement of the Advanced Defense Research Project Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the future visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government scholarships, says Lee.
"China is not the one leading academic leaders, but the companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university geniuses to work at AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. push their efforts at AI.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors at AI," he said.
The Council of State of China has published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding for people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, says Lee.
Early this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include partners from industry and university, and the White House announced the formation of the selected artificial information committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2,000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, you currently invest over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not registered movement for months.
The Macedonians vote in referendum if they change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "North Macedonia Republic", a movement that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece and have blocked applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a complaint from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of both countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that change would prejudice the ethnic identity of most Slavic people in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the result will achieve the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper was: "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name defenders, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to get admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I've come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of members of parliament said that they would clarify the result of the vote and make it final.
Nine change would require a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The state election commission stated that no irregularities had been recorded at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters deposited their vote.
"I come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of the country's name that would open the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the stores mounted for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We're in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads up and not through the service door," added Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev states that accession to NATO will bring the much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour of it because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entry into the EU and NATO," Zaev commented after depositing their vote.
He said a positive result would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the required.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian television station Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he'd vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since it had gained power in May of the past.
View: Sergio AgÃ¼ero, Manchester City player, crosses the entire Brighton defense and ends up marking a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling accounted for Brighton's defense with Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple to mark the 65th minute goal.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading to the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
A defense was cast before it passed several more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English front used the first touch on the area to return the ball to Aguero, which hit Brighton Mathew Ryan's bodyguard with a shot to the right of the network.
"Aguero is going through some problems on his foot," said the coach of the City, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky you marked it at that time."
But Sterling gave the blues the initial advantage in the battle of the Premier League.
That goal arrived at the 29th.
I agÃ¼ro received the ball in the depth of Brighton's field in that play.
He sent a beautiful pass to the right-hand side of Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite post.
The blues put the ball in the door before they left the camp.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals out of the struggle for elimination, there weren't many reasons to force another title.
But always competitive Scherzer expects to launch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the Rockies disposal, which brings an advantage game to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies have secured at least one position of the wild with victory 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to close their title of first division.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I played this year.
Why won't I want to compete on that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the opener will be on Sunday, but apparently they're inclined to be what Scherzer throws in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom his start number 34 would be, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch on Sunday on his usual rest day.
The right hand of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the elected Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he talks about the importance of the outcome in the elections of half a term.
"We played everything we did in November.
Five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't have to, but I really do, and that's why I'm going on all sides fighting for big candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You've seen this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what's happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, evil, and petty.
They don't care who's hurting, above who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we're never gonna give it to him."
The task of Democrats is to oppose and hinder."
"And you've seen that the past four days," he said, qualifying the Democrats for "annoyances, valvados, disgusting and liars."
He enumerated the Senate Judiciary Committee quoting Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong applause from the public.
"Remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm..ejem, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
He is not tolerant of those who express his opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour Members who are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because he was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, by chance, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday indicated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I've been a Labour Member, the committee's Friday night meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, when fellows who believed to share a similar political vision began to expect me to portray and adopt positions that I would never agree with, whether in terms of national security or the single EU market.
When I speak publicly, and actually of a little equal what I say, there's a tremendous rush and attacks on social networks censoring center politics, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments to me are usually political in nature.
It impresses me the professionalism and determination of fellows who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult were standardized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every "untrust" movement or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower in its eyes.
Over the past few years, I've received a lot of advice that urges me to keep my head down, not to be so frank and that then "everything would be all right for me."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there were 32 still in school, led by the neglect of Thatcher's government that literally dropped my class, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them, both as local concelerator and as government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused with my political stances and that I do not agree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted the Friday motion, all I would say is that while the country is walking towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy by questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invicto Ayr gets in the head
The last two attempts may have somewhat altered the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this fine party of the Lieutenant Premier League.
Now they lead the table and it's the only invict team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk of taking him, the team took him to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far they've put the test on our parties and we're still invicts, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "It must be acknowledged that Ayr took advantage of opportunities better than we do."
The essay at minute 14 by Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put in front of the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the party by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers and Jason Baggot caught a wrong launch.
Climate increased the advantage for Ayr with penaltyti, before he, just in the middle of time, turned a shot into solitary, leaving the marker 17-5 in favor of Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop by the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which abandoned the camp into a padilla and, since the beginning, Ayr has advanced further through a Stafford McDowall essay, transformed by Clima.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with an unconsumed Bruce Colvine essay, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the local team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for plagiarizing Clima when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson marked an essay from the penal line at the back of Ayr's mule.
Climamo marked, as he had done almost since the start, after Kyle Rowe picked up the launch in David Armstrong's area and had sent it to Gregor Henry's third line to get the fifth essay from the local team.
Still Game protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
The star of Still Game, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after finding out that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, writing and co-protagonizing with his old partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final one, and it seems that Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's own restaurant business.
'The sea is ours': interior Bolivia hopes the court will be on its way to the Pacific
The sailors watched a naval thirst covered with apparatus in La Paz.
The public buildings have a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are flooded with the slogan: "The sea is our right.
Retrieve it is a duty."
In Bolivia without a sea, the memory of a lost coastline in Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, just like the desire to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their peak in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see CIX's sentence on giant screens all over the country in the hope that the Hague Court will speak out in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile will be forced to negotiate the granting of Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial reelection battle next year, also has much to do with Monday's sentence.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia the reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to affect Chilean territory, and it has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that CIX's sentence comes only six months after the final arguments we have heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," says Chilean expert in international law Paz ZÃ¡rate.
And far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years could have delayed it.
"The topic of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration," ZÃ¡rate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric threatened Chile's remaining goodwill, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo RodrÃ­guez VeltzÃ©, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court would make an unusually rapid decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile," and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, even one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this subject for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can be trusted in the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong states that his nation will not pursue nuclear disarmament unless he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment occurs at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey seems to be about to restart stagnant nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri claims it's "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korean War can double the North.
In Washington, they refuse to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the shops.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or either cover yourself completely from the sun, stop looking for them.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the gateway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that caught the public in the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers draw their most surprising creations from the gateway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated bead hat adorned with a broad fan imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories there were dried sandstones, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving team, with glasses and the tube, and others a melted ice cone.
And if it's a huge fashion fan, it's lucky.
The fashionable understandings predicted that giant caps could reach the shops.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomb", the straw hat with a 60-inch tab that takes everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks pulled out the gateway another great creation: a ball beach bag almost as large as the model worn with a swimsuit that carries it.
The orange raft bag decorated with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather wing was the highlight of the spring 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera on Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I hope the big hats and beach bags arrive at the shops next summer, for the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for overcrowding accessories'.
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland's private schools maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the highest level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for their chosen career and place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that strikes him in the head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and at the highest approved rates in private schools.
About 68% of students who studied foreign languages got an outstanding one.
Data from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS show that 72% of students received honorary enrollment in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding one.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages are currently considering subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all kinds of school programs.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that, among the lack of language knowledge, 17% of the reasons why employers are at risk of filling vacancies.
So linguistic skills are increasingly needed to prepare for youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more work possibilities that require languages.
Regardless of your chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% didn't speak any foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others focus on languages considered more important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of which their children's interests are, private schools always have several languages to choose from and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may be.
We cannot deny that at the moment, in a global business environment, languages are still of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
We have to do this.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron starts with Lakers or Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the eveningrs who want to see LeBron James playing with Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
The team trainer, like Walton, announced that James will play the initial pre-war game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still up to decide how many minutes he'll play.
"It'll be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After early week training, they asked James about his plans for six Lakers parties.
At this point in my career I don't need pre-time matches to be ready," he said.
Trump's electoral acts arrive in Virginia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump's 5 scheduled hits for the next week, including stops in cities close to him like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation on a pause for your candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump seeks support for the next half-term elections, since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today on Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's rally in West Virginia following via live stream via YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with the subject of the trial held this week for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who keeps the Senate confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of myths is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new impulse.
So these five myths that Trump will give next week are aimed at "damaging volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters says.
"Congress control is so important for your schedule that the president will travel to as many states as possible towards the campaign season," said Reuters to a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be appointed.
The rally tonight, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage of Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate of West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist from West Virginia University to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: USA Team shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive to individual Sunday parties
After three individual sessions, the ant on Saturday afternoon could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse oscillating pendulum is a totally invented sport concept but what sportsmen really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I guess we'll take that as a little boost," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in favor and much to cheer up about, among other things, the Spieth and Justin Thomas technique, which played together all day and each account with three points of four.
Spieth has turned out lethal from tea to green and is preaching with the example.
Those guttural screams became stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie up the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
By getting the putt that made them win the game on the 15th, he screamed similarly, the kind of scream that says he thinks the American team is not yet out.
"Just concentrate and worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to let hit.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of four and they can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way it seems to flow its energy into the crowd and from it, confirms them as the rivals to hit Sunday, and there could not be more popular players to win a victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio GarcÃ­a, the tomorrow furball hero, when he paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended up with Spanish and Swedish in a hole they've never been near to leave.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and ants are so fascinating to see closely the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they give, the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team up to now and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the USA Team has a struggle, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has an advantage of 10-6 the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and the ants with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired two made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to climb four points to the score in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who seeks to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the ants, winning four games, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to earn four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points from the four initial games in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they fit perfectly to defeat an undisclosed Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who fought two parties on Saturday without pain or glory, showed occasional bursts of brightness, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in the modalities of fourballs and foursomes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested at the fourballs in the morning, rejoined his partner Henrik Stenson in the ants by picking up a defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in southwestern Paris.
Three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the point of reference for Americans achieving two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter on fourballs and won back to Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 on foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in the history of Ryder Cup where a team dates up four points in the individual, although as the current trophy holder, Furyk's team just needs to draw to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Colour says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased his mistrust in the United States and that the country would not surrender its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show its goodwill" last year, as to stop nuclear and missile tests, dismantle nuclear testing camps and commit to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the United States," he added.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first."
While Ri resumed the known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual denuclearization" by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, since it did not refuse unilateral denuclearization as it had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump on the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump ensured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long been seeking a formal ending for the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective of coercive action, and even if they oppose "declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the sanctions continue to exacerbate our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the American leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Even so, Ri's tone of speech was radically different from last year's, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after Trump's "wicked President" called Kim "man rocket on a suicide mission."
This year in the UN, Trump, who threatened to " utterly destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for her bravery by taking disarmament action, but said that much work remains to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday Trump said there was no end to it, and that "it's not like it takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, however, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompey, told the UN Security Council that: "The fulfilment of the Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He abandoned Pyongyang in July saying that he had moved forward, just a few hours after North Korea had denounced him for making "mafia-like demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile settlement, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took the "corresponding measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was asking were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the advance towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of machist culture from studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
An academic found out that university students at number one in the world often do not know the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Muller, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact the lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached me and said, 'Why do they only tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said that no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," The Telegraph commented.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The hour course duration involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are informed of how the lack of prolonged sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what health effects they are if we choose to smoke tobacco," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of spending the whole night awake still exists, he says, and he adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students involved in lack of sleep was a growing problem.
To ensure that he sleeps long enough and that he has a good quality sleep must be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he points out. Even avoids fattening, as lack of sleep causes the brain to enter mode of insanity, which makes him constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course across the campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. Even so, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting, which can debalance the circadian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal overthrows Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team of Ibox intended to record their first home win since the 4-1 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team led to Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which he left his team at eight points from Hearts, leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a low-inspired Ranger alignment never gave the feeling that he was betting.
While the Rangers went down to the sixth place, Livingston went up to the third place and was just behind the Hibernian with a difference goal.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had to have dealt with a head wound after the supposed launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that dragged the Ayr into the semi-finals of Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 Livingston who drew a point to Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his joint organization suffocated its opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have marked it in just two minutes when the short pass of the first time of Menga sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's office, but the camper centre wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot from Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Litthgow, only managed to tie him to the second pole.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than conviction about their play in the offensive area.
Alfredo Morelos no doubt felt that they should have pitted penalty at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only fired two shots at the door in the first half, but the old Ibox ranger, Liam Kelly, had hardly any trouble with the end of Lassana Coulibaly's head and the attack by Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingston's opening at minute 34 could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in facing Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher laced the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the blood cold to choose the Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard acted at rest when he changed Coulibly by Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left-wing made a pass to Morelos, but the imponent Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston kept devouring visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long ball after another.
Holt's team might have extended the advantage at the end, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Ranger's substitute, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty by tying with Jacobs, but Thomson made his sights fat again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning German: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTACT... was the day that the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally led him to the device known as Geiger counter.
A piar of science since then, accountant Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Say, it's bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that takes its name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of the treatment
The method implies the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
They can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovaries cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method implies the extraction of a patient's immune cells, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of Bethesda's National Cancer Institute, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "impresses the growth of various types of cancer," including those of breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "tests" to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump using a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance in the program Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result wasn't good.
During a Saturday Night Live program, Kanye West was posted in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's a racist?"
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the program with a satire star played by Matt Damon, where Hollywood's star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on the demands for sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it hasn't been released, Chris Rock has risen the images of West's criticism of social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had had had a bad time behind him because of his hat.
"They passed with me in the backyards.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They bullied me!
And then they said he was going to pick me up," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pick up?", saying that I'm going to "put on my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do."
Try with love."
His comments sparked applause at the audience at least twice and the members of the SNL cast seemed to be ashamed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave the publication: "The whole study was silent at all."
They had been appointed West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, the rapist Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left a lot of people perplexed by an interpretation of the song I love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier water.
West obtained support from the conservative group leader TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for making FRONT TO MAFIA"
However, the presenter of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was just "being who it is and that's completely wonderful."
"So and everything, I chose NOT to reward anyone (purchasing their music or clothing or supporting their "art") who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "the officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name; he follows Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The accused is expected to appear before the Court of Magistrates of Belfast on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its sword handling role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantastic series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a machist hero, saying that said roles on the screen translate into what it seems like young people often have to be hard to respect them.
When talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era (#EuTamen).
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she feels "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can partly be responsible for increasing the toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, clearly, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not do any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, claiming that "sufficient horses and battlefields."
As of November, Kit will lead to a replacement of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considered his encounter with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this program, so somehow she provided me with my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit character Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects over 820,000 people in the country, the health authorities declared.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, internationally, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from the Republican Party senators, "dangerous minds" and "conspirating theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators of the U.S. Republican Party on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators from the ultrarights.
"Mention, lies and more infamous lies," Waters commented in a statement on Twitter.
According to it, the widespread information included the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the United States government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, has not been responsible in any way for the filtration of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie."
Waters' statement immediately sparked online criticism, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This lie has become angry," wrote Fleischer.
"You understand he has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something they haven't done, they mustn't get angry.
You must not be challenging.
You mustn't question the defendant's motives.
You must remain approachable and serene."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing the Waters reaction with the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to unbank Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it were true" he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department warned "the entities responsible for the enforcement of the law and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent accusations.
"We'll make sure we find out the culprits," he continued, "so that they consider themselves legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all of my team members."
Criticism by Johnny English Strikes Again in Action, the helpless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new British films and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and action comedy by Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire become about the matter of the obviously stupid that we are on the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, Johnny English's incompetent hopper-eyed character and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comical creation designed for non-anglophone cinematic territories.
Of course, it's the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of adulation glamorous glamorous, has a bit of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr Bean and a piece of that kind who contributed with a single note on the topic of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It's also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once played on Barclaycard's now forgotten TV commercials, in which he was sowing chaos at his own pace.
There's a couple of good moments at Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor steps make a brief noise against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy jumps to the eye, but it gives the impression that humor is weak and strangely superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious" film, such as 007 and Impossible Mission, already uses comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed at children, instead of adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misfortunes are not as clever or concentrated as Atkinson's film jokes changes by embodies Bean's character.
Now the constantly topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates Britain's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, for the distress of the agent on duty, a unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the big deal for a desperate and desperate prime minister, who has already suffered a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself to this character who almost looks Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisors don't know that as all active spies are engaged, they must take someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but he teaches off-duty about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with their old and suffering companion Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the misdeeds of His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, meeting with the beautiful fatal wife of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is doing dangerously succumb to the charm of the multi-millionaire technological charismatic claiming that it can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough initiate their hatred of ridiculous falcatruades: disguised as waiters, set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; create a riot that illegally puts them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to become familiar with the inside of the home of Volta.
Of course, all arrests come out of this last sequence, but in a kind and shocking way, they seem to be taken out of a child's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies it's designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they're covering for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but cover for five
Supposedly, the party wants entrepreneurs to spend their savings through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would be "fit up" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Trade Union Congress supported four-day shifts a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to balance the economy for the worker, as well as the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
Even so, the Labour Party does not currently support ambition as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesperson said, "A four-day workweek does not enter the party's politics and is not being considered by it."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of the chancellor in the shadow also imply the possibility that current water company shareholders do not recover all of their investment, as a Labour Government could perform "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on business councils and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the private sector shares to employees, who embolish annual dividends of up to Â£500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation about Kavanaugh might make them change their mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh took at least a week behind the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court.
On Sunday, at an interview, the reporter of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charge came out and asked him if he had.
It was firm, determined, rotting."
However, Graham's vote seems unremovable.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive poster of stars that will act and an equally impressive mission, ending world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people come on call to Central Park's Great Lawn area, not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the poverty end event by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen at 12 years of age to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of the so-called cyclicism, people who think it makes a difference when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says he has registered more than 19 million "actions" from his followers, pushing a different set of goals.
He claims that these actions helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that until now guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and executive company that has committed itself to "helping children develop to their maximum potential", with the promise of providing Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, the patients, the national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with interventions on nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered, "It will be a long and difficult path and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way that happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to make a "block" to hinder energy exports from Russia, announced the U.S. Home Secretary
"In case it is necessary," Washington may resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where the legitimate government is operating, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe," he said, as reported.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, along with the navy, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called himself the "power consumer's voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, considering that in practice it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying that he only has a tactic with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream pipeline 2 of 11 billion dollars, which was established to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is argued only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said the Russian Energy Minister, Aleksandr Novak, following the meeting with the U.S. Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, which took place in Moscow in September.
The US stance got Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry's leading organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI, by its German acronym), called on the US to move away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully review her candidacy for the presidency in 2020, Senator of Massachusetts told
On Saturday, the senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said he would carefully examine his candidacy for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the government fracture and that includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency.
Warren thought about President Donald Trump during the public meeting, stating that he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was shown that most Warren voters themselves do not believe that it will be presented by 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said the senator would not file her candidacy, according to the survey by the University of Suffolk's Political Research Center and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the former governor's candidacy, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include the previous Vice-President, Joe Biden, and Senator de Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, he informed the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin quotes the post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) of Track Palin nomin de Donald Trump
Twenty-six-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"With what my own son is going through, with which he's going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of TEPT and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," he explained to the audience at a rally by Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was taboo and that his son and other war veterans "returned different, hardened, wondering whether there was respect for what militia and aviators, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Columbia District are challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a judicial remedy in connection with a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district presented a court friendly report in Washington to support an asylum-seekers who challenge politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff for Grace v. Sessions Prize that the American Civil Liberties Union (U.S. Union for Civil Liberties) filed in August against federal politics did not prove itself.
She said that her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that the U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations that face widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international legislation."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assisted according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle," explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that refuses the entry of immigrants damages the American economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide labor".
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who escape domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said on June 11.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby at the evacuation center of the city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses, collecting their dregs, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of wounded people and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured their backs and shoulders, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he had shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then only silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of abusing "propagandistic announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper begging for the benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, referred to the payment supplement China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of entering the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, marked what the officials of that country coined in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it's normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war as a witness to the leveling of tariffs in their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the USA, China's compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm exporters from states like Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
In an opinion paper written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of Moines Register, it was stated that China "is intensifying this harassment campaign by spreading propaganda advertisements in the free US press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the American tradition of freedom of expression and press when it published a payment announcement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the post of newspapers at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissenting voices and there is no real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese can have on China's worrying economic trajectory, since the media are under the strong thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he states that "one of China's most important journals declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm what it was.
Kavanaugh's disaster loses female Republican vote a few days from half-term elections
Although many of the major Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various accusations of sexual assaults, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially female voters, in the next half-term elections.
The reactions to these accusations were numerous and most Republicans were positioned to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell school at Syracuse University in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that it is doubtful that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation is sufficient to calm the spirits of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget what happened in the near future or in November," pondered Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, in Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, the flu of "Arcase November!", spoke in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, with the control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will surpass any expectation," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It is true that he is already tall,
But it's going to be even more, especially among the indecisive voters in the neighborhoods or those between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the President, don't usually go to the polls."
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to have a violent reaction if Republicans kept on with confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the week on the NBC News channel.
This goes beyond the committee's vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the defendant's bank or not.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing the testimony of Ford or that of Kavanaugh, even though they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents fully or probably believe Ford's testimony, compared to 35% that supports Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is more likely to lie during his testimony than 30% who thinks the same about Ford.
Following the pressure exerted by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of oblivion when she was 17.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a university party when he was studying in Yale in the '80s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee lucky that the intention to hide Inrupt is to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage" or POD.
Contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available on a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has full control over who can access which information.
The company calls this a "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer developers.
From this week on, developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would modify your business models from day to day.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has stood up as an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee is still the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Homage to Bernard Vann, churchman decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous homage in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded September 29, 1918, in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been granted the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were charged with discovering a memorial monument in his honor at a parade in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the feat of his grandfather who deserved the title.
According to the London Gazette publication, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led to his battalion by the Saint-Quentin channel "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gunfire."
Later he hurried to get to the line of fire and, with "great courage," directed the line forward before he rushed with a cannon and without any help, and brought down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson still."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the Brentwood Imperial youth band.
Michael Vann said he felt "my honour to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts MMA fans at the best time
Imagine you've been awake all night to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when the best part comes something prevents you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 combats, six main ones, and was broadcasting live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But at 6:00 in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see their faces, the United Kingdom spectators were puzzled when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many waking hours waiting to see the struggle.
An amateur described the shift to these childish cartoons on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste."
"State regulations refuse that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and that's why it had to change to children's programming," explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Marketing and Bellator's Communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said they would take UK viewers into account in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think of repetition," said Coker.
"But if it's 6:00 a.m. there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will already be Monday to them.
But we're working on finding a solution.
When the change occurred, I started getting lots of messages and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six.

Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic jumper, claims he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Invited by the first broadcast of the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is on sick leave.
As a guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "lower" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked children and girls."
He said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what pushed me and gave me the strength to achieve success."
I wanted to prove it was "someone" so people wouldn't feel disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
Three times a champion of the world said he fell in love with the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so much in so little time" (with only 14 years of age he first participated in the Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who had experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley totally change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are things far more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son to do were tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I haven't been able to tell you that I wouldn't be here to occupy that first row," Daley shared.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was at that precise moment, at the moment of his death, when I realized that he wasn't really invincible," he adds.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that this was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling" confirmed.
The choice of the Proud song by Heather Small is not in vain either, since it is the melody that accompanied you during your preparation for the Olympics and still puts your hair at the top.

A Mickelson in low shape ended up at Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday
American Phil Miccelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must improve his technique so that this doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or in Saturday's ants.
Instead of being the center of action, as many other times to the United States, five times champions spent the day encouraging and working to improve their movements.
Although it was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of their career, at the age of 48 it does not fit in the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the high grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And in case this wasn't enough, Mickelson faced in the ninth Sunday game to the precise Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below the beginning of the 12 individual matches, start with a good foot, Miccelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he could not say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he played today, gave me a slap on my shoulder, put his arm through me and told me that tomorrow he would be ready," Furyk shared.
"I fully trusted myself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end that's the way things are, and so we thought they should be.
Like everybody else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played at Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, a race that never reached the level of his individual palmarÃ©s.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangible to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with genius and he likes to get into people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see how good the younger players have had with him this week.
He's much more with a good player."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup individuals can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danes started in 1997 in a match in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seven Ballesters had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the target line with a minimal advantage winning 141â2-131â2.
"You keep thinking that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won a little bit," Bjorn reflected, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows this hasn't finished yet.
Tomorrow we have to go everywhere.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won't get tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enthralled with the performance of their players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before.
Tomorrow we face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a partner next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then put your ability as a golfer to the test.
That's the message you need to pass on to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for its players to have a better individual performance than with their peers, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides two extremes of those last day turns, being part of the winning team in Brookline, but ending up as a loser after the European miracle in Medinah."
"I remember every damn word," he answered when he was asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players face-to-face on the last day.
"We have 12 important matches, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline's or Medina's.
When you see the impulse going in one direction, there's a lot of pressure in those middle parties.
We prepare our alignment taking this into account and placing the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIllroy in the first party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, at the top half of the ranking.
"I have decided this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn explained about his selection for individuals.
The new German warship postponed once again
The youngest strawberry of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it won't reach at least next year due to faulty systems and increasing cost, they reported local media.
The post in service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the flaming frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will count on a powerful cannon, with different anti-hero and anti-ship missiles, as well as hide technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to spread the younger frigates up to two years off the original ports.
However, as Die Zeit points out well, these ongoing delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was reported last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a boat to a builder after the delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind this return, but the German media talked about "critical defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the 7 thousand-ton Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar class ships that Germans used in World War II.
Besides the faulty hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has reached the amazing amount of 31 billion euros, compared to the 22 billion initials.
The problems of the younger frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is making water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships capable of deploying.
The officer claims that this problem is getting bigger, as old ships have been removed, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
A new research that is being carried out on a Highlands farm in Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as bats Myotis daubentoni and Plecottus auritus in the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An audio analysis performed by experts on all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
Then a Habitat Map will be developed to create a detailed picture of the landscape scale of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to show which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
Populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and the loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and lighting also pose a risk, as well as stick traps for flies, some chemical treatments for building materials and domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't blind.
but because of his night hunting habits, his ears are more useful than his eyes in hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, inspections of children and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reserve of Scotland bats in Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Scotland bats.
David Thompson, state manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Thrave we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to prosper."
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before performing maintenance tasks in the properties, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single infant of maternity can kill up to 400 females and infants, which could exterminate a whole local population.
The bats are a protected species and it's illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There is still much to learn about bats and, in the case of many species, we don't know how they go to their populations."
Ronaldo dismisses the demands for rape and his lawyers prepare to demand the German publication
Christian Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know using his name.
Your lawyers will sue German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these charges.
The head of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rapeing Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's glad the footballer paid the woman $375,000 so he didn't say anything about the incident, published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after his release, 33-year-old Ronaldo has locked up this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
"No, not a thousand times not.
What was said today is false," he said to the camera five times the winner of the Golden Ball.
"People want to get to know each other using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for just saying my name, it's part of my job.
I am a happy and respectable man," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which qualify as "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the area of privacy" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her annually, according to documents presented at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the supposed incident, kneeled down saying he was 99% a knight, but that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that they both maintained sexual relations agreed on by both sides.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that she had photographs of the wounds, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt terrified by reprisals and was worried about the public ridicule.
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to revoke the deal while she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Automobile manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would regret forever losing its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had stated in the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"It is necessary to reach an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that, in the event that Brexit had not reached any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which is responsible for manufacturing the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150 000 vehicles last year, from which 90 % was exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain abandons the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses of how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other United Kingdom car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his Mini plant at Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain if there is no agreement in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very tight, and every 37 minutes, parts of UK and EU suppliers arrive for custom-made cars.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and there could be delays and shortages of pieces.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to keep a normal pace more than a day on Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark states that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid such border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so to enjoy the current success but also to make the most of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota couldn't estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run, added costs would reduce plant competition and even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston's employee for 24 years and United union coordinator, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
One government spokesman said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House claimed that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and Rosenstein's Deputy Secretary of Justice could be delayed for another week due to the struggle by the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, the links between Russia's assistants and Trump, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General or not, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence, he's been fueling the rumors in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein talked about using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among reports that they indicated he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to prevent a shock from the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation to the FBI about allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Before the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied, "There's still no fixed date, it could be this week, or it might take another week, given all that's going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press to be informed."
Some journalists have questioned this claim, since Sanders has since September 10 without holding a press conference.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said that the lack of information session was not due to an aversion to the greatness of reporters, although he added that it will not be she who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president said," he said, although he did not quote any source that had endorsed that data.
They will continue to hold briefings, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that's much better than addressing the questions to her.
You are witnesses of how we've been doing this for the last few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, press conferences alone are scarce.
Maybe the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions before the journalists gathered.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the spirits before Brexit
The Health Secretariat sent a letter to EU workers in the NHS in Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and expressing its wish to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months away from the UK.
The Scottish Government has committed itself to covering the cost of applications for EU citizens working in their decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this fall.
However, the United Kingdom government, for its part, has also intensified its preparations for a possible non-agreement situation.
I know this is a period of anxiety for everyone.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
European Union partners, and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury during the defeat of Saturday (31-27) against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's trainer, informed the journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he passed out when he got to the band line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before he took it on a stretcher to carry out a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, WSMV journalist at Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Even so, he added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when this injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year Red T-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before he left the party, which raised his total of the season to 18th.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp taxes will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money raised will be used to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the streets.
The charge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second houses and purchases for rent, may be up to 3%.
Fairy hopes that the change will be able to collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13% of London's new constructions are sold by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulties accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a cut in farm tax to help new people acquire their first home.
He accused the big builders of maintaining the prices of high housing by buying soil and not using it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate the tax revenue percentages on moderate-priced houses to fix the "vile shame of the housing sector" that lives in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of housing-related reform proposals, including the control of renters and the prohibition of evictions where the lodger is not to blame.
He also wants to grant the municipalities the greatest powers when building new housing.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it's necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
It's not fair, however, that it's just as easy for those people who don't live in the United Kingdom as well as foreign-based businesses to buy housing than for British resident workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity that is supposed to not have a roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland"
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, said his "last ambition" was to become Scotland's picker at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club of the northwest, which currently occupies the third square in the League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that was all," said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a boy, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I'm successful in running a club."
Among Ross's predecessors in the position of Sunderland coach are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims that he felt no concern about the success of those consolidated figures in such a large club after he had previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Will success for me depend at this time if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly owned by a Premier League club," he said.
"It won't be a simple task to arrive, but it's likely that I only thought I was successful here if I could return the club to the Premier."
Ross has only been a coach for three years after an assistant period at Dumbarton and a 15-month period within Hearts' technical staff.
At that time, he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St Mirren back from being about to go down and win the Championship title at the next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he's ever encountered during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Probably found me at a real crossroads," he remembered, about taking over the Halloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because it wasn't bad for me, I made a reasonable living and enjoyed some success.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and pressure from work, but I like training.
I've always liked training and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulties, but put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
Pubs and bars experienced an increase of 2.7 percent during July, but consumption in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent according to figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA trade advisory, in charge of compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's stay in the football world for longer than expected resulted in a pattern similar to that of June, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, even though restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The drop of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants during June has worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in drinks were the best results obtained with increases in consumption above the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specialized in meals also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the pubs and bars controlled consumption of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and that of meals decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an employee of the RSM company of analysis of leisure and hospitality activities, said: "These results imply a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to out-of-home consumption.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent per cent per year will be especially painful if this is added to the continuous increase in costs.
The warm and long summer couldn't have arrived at a worse time for restoration businesses and time will be responsible for saying whether the moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the much needed breath for the sector."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with benefits of more than Â£9 billion and is considered the industry reference point.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children (some only 11 years old) have secret social networks accounts that hide their parents and teachers from a survey
A poll conducted at 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "False Insta"
This news has caused an increase in the fear of sexual content being published
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children (some only 11 years old) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "False Insta" accounts (referred to the social photo exchange network Instagram).
This news has caused an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a "principal" account that was softened to show their parents while they had other privates.
A mother who took on the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked for her to be raped.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between 11 and 18 years old had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's head Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the council of the Scottish athletic federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish athletic federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, the United Kingdom and worldwide, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its incorporation into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said the following: "I have a lot of desire to be a spokesman for athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympic gold and currently working as a usual BBC commentator, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered from a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and until grade.
It was a exhausting job, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and I am currently doing agile exercises.
Thank you for your courage messages."
An announcement from a breast milk extractor in comparison to women with cows divides public opinion on the networks
A breast milk extractor company divided public opinion into networks with an ad compared to breast-feeding mothers with mugging cows.
To announce the launch of the so-called "first silent portable milk extractor from the world," Elvie has published an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new milk extractor to the mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of mud for the cows at the rhythm of a song with lyrics like the following: "Yes, I muse myself, but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not drunk, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on, "Mush, mug, I'm feeding babies, mug, mug, mugging my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among viewers. Many of them said that it made the "horrors" of the dairy sector manifest.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth," wrote one.
Elvie's milk extractor can be discreetly placed into a mother's holding (Elvie/mother)
Another viewer commented the following: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and baby.
But yes, why don't they use it to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What an ad with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the announcement, even one woman said that the song seemed "very funny."
"It seems to me to be a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Getting my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little shot, but I played it like a joke.
I think it's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad directed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like "vacas".
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals they've been dancing with the discreet extractors inserted in their subjects.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can discreetly fit into a motherly bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even get out there while they're extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallelism that exists between women and milk cows, we want to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges that it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining and close manner the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time that Extractor Elvie holds headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children emigrated silently to a camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained emigrants increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly due to rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration made it difficult to assign godparents to children.
Traditionally, most godfathers were also immigrants without papers and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential fathers and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that those data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking U.S. Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified to Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to help minors without company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of the people who are godfathers or who are part of the home of these people are found illegally in the country, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to prosecute children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require any of these to appear in court before the end of a month since their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the refugee workers.
Many will come by video conferencing instead of in person to try to legalize their case against an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can cause violent seizures or escape attempts by the refugees and system reports published in recent months.
The lawyers claimed that these fears increase in centers of greater dimensions than Tornillo, where there is more chance that the symptoms that a child is having a bad time will go unnoticed because of its size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them from the emotional point of view or to say good-bye to friends might lead to a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were illegally found in Syrian soil, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he informed the assembly.
Moulem insisted that the "war on terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleared all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of the refugees, Moualem stated that the right conditions were given for his return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We turn to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement takes place between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last great rebel bastion of Idlib allowed for continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions would be destined for the Jihadists, including soldiers from the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
The envoy of UN Staffan of Mixture is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draw up an outline of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem laid out the conditions for ensuring the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump is going to win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would be able to re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals would put an end to his presidency in an early manner.
In what would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of weariness among observers.
Since 2014, prime-time audiences have multiplied by more than two, up to 1.05 million viewers at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on prime-time, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led the audience rates for cable channels with 3.5 million spectators during the nights where important news occurred.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a drama showrunner for ABC "Designated Survival", who deals with a secretary from the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, he asked her.
"He answered, 'Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There is entertainment inside the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, Washington's plots can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, if emigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Still, suppose something goes beyond being an informed citizen spends six hours watching a panel of experts debate on the use made by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar fur bomber jacket ("a garment full of arrogance," Washington Pos said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s bold descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, a space that deals with the changes in characters and the daily argumental turns of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L., the compliments to Kim Jong-un...).

When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, he was setting sun and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house, on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't stand up while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
"I remember when we were all doing those crazy shows back then and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke species, but it turns out they were right."

External money is enough to finance the House's candidatures for the election of half the legislature
It is no surprise that the 17th Congressional district in Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a Congressional district with two representatives in career functions to occupy the same position.
This district located outside Pittsburg which was recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who obtained his position in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania determined in January that Republicans manipulated the electoral district of the old districts in their favor.
The electoral career in the new 17th congress district triggered a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congress Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after reaching an adjusted victory in the special elections of March to the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a broad follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
The political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States appreciated the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support to China and then they went back
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a nice meeting with Panama's president, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners launched the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to order to return to heads of US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the spokesperson of the department in a statement made this month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against O Salvador was fought, which received approximately $140 million in US aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid.
The sanctions proposed, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration from people to the United States.
But in mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions for O Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to conduct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance that the administration attaches to him, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations always and when participants' anonymity was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was retained.
Study History
The next negative case might be Robert Mueller's Special Adviser's report on the case of possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, of which there are currently abundant evidence in the public archive.
According to the record, Mr. Mueller is also conducting his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump's campaign has conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump must render accounts in that body, just when you have to prepare for the elections, and you may finally have to face a popular jury.
They're many unknowns and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to strike Hitler if the Western front resisted and supported Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killings that occurred later.
The course of history revolves around those turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy accelerates or goes backward.
The Americans are facing several of these inflection points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has carried the water to her neck since this paper reported that, last year, she suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that she was incapable of the charge.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times' information isn't true.
"How shall we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the credible accusations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, above all, will we vote in the half-legislative elections for a Congress that demands Mr Trump's responsibilities?
If we don't pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-lovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which was a known embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to arrest Shabbat's candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that inheritance, how am I not going to be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans player is optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
Rangers receives Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain against Villarreal this month, would put them in a very favourable position to qualify in Group G of Europe League.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from launching this season up to draw 2-2 in front of the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a trap to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, since the Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the party believing that we could get something positive and we reached a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to be able to reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last match, but with the support of our audience, I'm sure we can fight for a positive result.
Last year was tough among all that happened to my injuries and changes on the team, but there's an excellent environment right now.
The team's good, the boys are having a good time and training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget last season and succeed."
Women worry about saving their retirement
Despite the fact that the respondents in the survey were clear how they wanted to be looked after, few people spoke to their family about it.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide stated that they commented with their partners about the cost of extended care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want you to look after a relative, but they're not doing the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Department.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your couple and children, you can't prepare your family for care if you don't express your wishes to them in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to wake up where and how to receive care, since those decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor. Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever money is available.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
It also values the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You'll have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your father or older mother has a medical emergency and he's on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down that information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who care about it?" asked Martin.

Who'll take care of the dog?

A man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after going out at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in his chest, abdomen, and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place about 2:30 a.m. (British summer time) as a random act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His wounds aren't serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Because of the cut-off of communications, rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Domanga region, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
We then provided some key data on Palu and Domanga, on the island of CÃ©lebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central CÃ©lebes, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of CÃ©lebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Domanga is a region that is located along more than 300 km of coast northwest of the island of CÃ©lebes.
This region, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Central CÃ©lebes, especially in the coastal region of Domanga.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of CÃ©lebes.
Palu and Dojaga were hit by tsunamis several times during the last 100 years according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggana.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Dongaga in 1996, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the High Seismic Pacific Cinderella, so it suffers from earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which took place on December 26, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the deaths of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees of magnitude hit the south of Xava, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the deaths of nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees of magnitude occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees of magnitude affected the Mentawai Islands, located opposite Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the region of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people died from the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists shot temporarily.
Arrest Sarah Palin's eldest son for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, natural of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested suspected of a domestic violence crime, of preventing a complaint of domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bond, as informed KTUU.
He stood before the trial on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, of course," when he was asked, he informed the jail.
Palin faces three minor offences of type A, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and get a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor offence of type B, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time there's criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to denounce the alleged attack.
The case is currently in court for war veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of preventing a complaint of domestic violence and of possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress syndrome that she suffered after serving the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia provokes hundreds of deaths
There are at least 384 deaths after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of CÃ©lebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not available, and it is expected that the dead balance will increase with the passing of days.
The earthquake occurred right in front of Central CÃ©lebes, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos through the corporate networks where the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the town of Palu beach when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking to apply a few times the death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfulllo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway Avenue, following the life of the pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way to October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has "intendedly killed" the eight victims and caused serious injuries "intendedly", according to the notification of the intention of a death penalty application filed in the South New York District.
Both crimes imply the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by the prosecutors of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "markable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors declared in describing how Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego's family and friends Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the notice of intent to charge.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade now, the South District of New York has not prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being sentenced by conspiracy to commit spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months after the attack according to court documents.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he had done, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos that he viewed on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He declared himself not guilty of the indictment of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal agents responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting a life imprisonment guilt statement without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A member of parliament tory claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize a "people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that it should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Mr Peter Bone said before the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom "would have left the EU already" if Mr Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her party's divided ranks was evidenced by joining the Tories to stay in the EU for an independent protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain the commitments of his Czechs plan between the attacks of the supporters of Brexit, the opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he kept fighting to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave de Solihull movement that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
He suggested that you should have counted on Mr Farage to assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been given the job, we would be out of the EU by now," he said.
The Parliament member of Wellingborough added the following: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan.'
Showing his opposition to the EU, he stated: "We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone denied the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely false".
The member of the tories and supporters of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also came to the march, since she told the reporters: "The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Czechers' plan does not enjoy popularity among public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Checkers plan and start listening.â
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage stated in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians "feel uncomfortable" if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Today this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we're meeting today to tell them we won't let them leave with theirs."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit's decision, to be uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people from this country who gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become a proud, independent, autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with the message Tories Against Brexit after the group set up this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy free market without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
Â«It is an absolute farce.
The concept of good Brexit doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about presenting himself for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she'd think seriously about her candidacy after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in a Western Massachusetts locality.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is going to re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It focuses on speculations that place it as Trump's successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his electors using the council format since Trump took the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to introduce himself to the president.
Warren replied that it is time that "we women go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that we need a woman in the position of the presidency."
Arrest related to the death shot by Sims, the LSU player
Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in a press conference held at 11:00 (Easter Time).
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help in identifying a man who went out on the images.
Yes, 20-year-old, he was shot near the Southern University campus in the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and finally died as a result of it," reported Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde interfered to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being in the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and put in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2-meter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 headlines last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton comes to world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, who left from the pole, had a good way out and almost left Hamilton only while defending his position during the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into boxing first and let Hamilton run in traffic on the back of the group, which would prove decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxing a while later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton came forward after several wheeled maneuvers that caused Ferrari's driver to become reluctantly free of the inside at risk of being late after a double defensive maneuver in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and went up to the seventh square at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tires to get faster at the end and forward Kimi Raikkonen by fourth position.
He finally went into boxing on the round 44 but couldn't move forward any position on the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen on the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
An Inappropriate Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an event celebrated on Saturday by his insistence that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony to the Senate's Judiciary Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate proved that people were "mersible, repugnant and liar".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate last days, when you see the outrage, when you see the people who are angry and who are miserable, repugnant and liar," he said.
"When you see these publications and filtrations and they say, "Oh, I didn't go.
I didn't go."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you done any filtration?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't go.
Wait a minute.
Did we filter it?...No.", he added imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent her letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied the filtration from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," said Feinstein to the committee the second reported the newspaper The Hill.
"He asked me to keep his confidentiality and did what he asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to suit the president, who commented the following during the Saturday night act: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
He may not have leaked it, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get back to power and control," said President-in-Office of the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered on Friday in Elite League against Belfast Giants winning the game back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early advantage through two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were tied to the local set before Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied up for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat at the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to climb up to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was about the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three victories prior to the Giants'.
Dwyer's initial goal was made at 3:35 p.m. thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, and the second one arrived four minutes later from Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.

The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home in Milton Keynes their next party, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on an aircraft can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after he died to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The balance of dead people is 800 and many disappeared after a major earthquake shook Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and there are many people who are trapped under the debris of the city of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Great, refused to leave his post in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu Airport, which was violently balanced.
He stood at his post to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the exit at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News channel.
We set up a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Your heart is broken when you hear us," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death balance may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Dogalga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The victim's balance is created that it can continue to increase because there are many bodies under the debris and many of them could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesperson.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are transporting help and lives.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the minimarkets.â
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and informed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN informed.
Indonesia has suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims there's a missing one after an airplane accident in a lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there's a missing one after stating previously that the 47 passengers and crew left without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that she was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships from the area helped rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events continues to be unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed the runway from a long distance.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he came in with very little height.
"That's something extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers were able to move through the water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were shouting and frightened, and that he suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working close to the site on a pier's improvement also helped the rescue using an inflatable boat to transfer people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to data from Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
An analyst makes up the night's timeline when a woman was burned alive
The D.A. returned to the test on Saturday in the repetition of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used records of a mobile phone to recompose the motions of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones demonstrating that Telllis was meeting with Chambers on the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When these data showed that your mobile phone was meeting with Chambers during the time you said you were with your friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the street on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was " lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction consisted of Tellis claiming he had known Chambers for about two weeks before he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that a while after Chambers died, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"I've drawn her out of her life," said Hale.
It's scheduled for the defense to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be heard by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception the genre has by filling your music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and struggle against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the fighting hip hop back to be popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a survey in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York child caretaker demands a couple after a "racist" message
A New York child nurse is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that would not be addressed to her from the mother in whom she complained that she was "another black."
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her anguish to discover that Giselle Maurice's nurse was black when she introduced her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOON, OTHER BLACK," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs Maurice twice.
Upon realizing his mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs Maurice, claiming that the caretaker who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job badly and was waiting for a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs Maurice was paid the day she worked and sent home to an Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for a redundancies claim and demands a compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even if there was no contract by means.
"Look, I want to show you that these things don't happen," he told the Post on Friday, to add later, "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by claiming that firing Maurice was the most reasonable one, since they were afraid they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife had sent him a message that I didn't intend to send him.
He's not racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they offended, though it had been due to a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on!
After comparing the demand with an "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to go for a person like that?
That's not very ethical," the investment banker added.
As the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and the logic applied.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear as you can conclude in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented the following about the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we know about Paddington's huge success now."
After claiming that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of his work being refused, he added that the 60th anniversary of publishing the books was "agridose" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to which he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you're proud even if you didn't really do it.
I think I felt the success of Paddington a little like that.
Even though it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye over the phone.
After the landing, his daughter was quickly taken to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save his life.
"Nad regularly called to say that he was very bad, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I got the call from Nad to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
He had already died a while before and now he was shutting down.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to take it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapered, at that moment of mourning for her daughter's loss, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noticing the Calvary she was suffering.
"No one has detected him," he said.
"I had my head down and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive feeling of solidarity by Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Postcards of afflicted women to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are wearing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to which you can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel like I have to feel myself every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up any room."
However, he left work before he died and was "in a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm still concerned about a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people who can come and talk to, even if she's a friend.
Don't be quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"He hasn't told me he was sad or depressed or anything," he remarked.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
The Christmas Day touched the bottom (when the children opened their gifts, he made no visual contact with them or anything)."
He said that his death subjected a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He shattered the family.
They're tearing us apart.
But we have to keep going and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs a thread while the FBI initiates the investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), we might be able to get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that I was afraid the committee would be "drinking out" because of the paralyzing of the partisans.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do the investigation?
Its reticence is due to a matter of deadlines.
Five weeks are missing for the half-legislation elections (November 6). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently occupy 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea drops under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean deserters destined for South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, said that 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, away from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people in charge of crossing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of the deserters in the North finally offered them the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul states that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the largest border truce with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants instead of refugees and often return them.
The relationship between the North and the South (which technically continues to be at war) has improved considerably over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This took place after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, in which they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress ever since.
"If we don't trust the United States, we won't be able to trust our national security and, under these circumstances, there's no possibility of us unilaterally disarmament first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered against the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and says it's not appropriate to access the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and assured him that it was not appropriate for his nature to access the Supreme Court.
So he made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman would ever behave that way, they would call it hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement against the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, on occasion almost screaming and standing talking as he described his family and his school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the committee, cataloging the accusations against him as a "murder of grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by Liberals angry at the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
He claimed that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
So he objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in the post and if Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where you are currently," Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Tribunal.
He added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the law of patient protection and accessible health care or the Roe vs. Wade case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did away with questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to access the court and still above all wait for us to say, look how good!" said Pelosi.
And women need to practice it.
It's a justified diatrics, months and years of fury overflowing, and you can't throw it out without crying.
"We looked when we were angry," Mrs. Steinen told me 45 years later.
"Don't think it's so weird, do you?"
He went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that consisted of that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You better think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he kept going.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories in one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, in which I began to cry with an impossible rage to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of her neck, a distant superior who had always provoked me a slight fear, and led me to the hollow of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidatures.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was taken on an adventure outside of marriage on a ship named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," said I between laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancanoes and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fundraising, so he swore he wouldn't get into the presidency's career unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only contribute $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" he asked.
When he gave his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (thank you to the people who supported him, by frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates and angry with existing sexism) who were left speechless.
"You would think he had suffered a nervous crisis," reminded Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my stone?
"Did you choose?"
In what ways can trade war between the United States and China be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were annoying and, despite the fact that the war is far from over, a gap between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning earlier this year recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs that affect an equivalent of $200 billion, recording half of the articles coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has increasingly counterattacked the most recent rate from five to ten percent to 60 billion dollars in American products.
China has promised to imitate American measures and it seems unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will change in the short term.
To get Washington to step back, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but publicly bending to the United States would be much more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts claim that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favour China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions needed to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research center in Asia at the Center for New American Security, a center of studies.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is requesting help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions are now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their livelihoods.

Europe wins the victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the US team by a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The American star Phil Miccelson, who was the most battle he offered during the tournament, sent the water ball in the 16th pair 3 hole, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shone on all his series, becoming one of the only four players who got a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was implemented in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst ranking player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olsen, from Denmark.
The first ranking in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
One veteran with eight Ryder Cups disputed, Spanish Sergio GarcÃ­a became the European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I don't often cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad I could have helped," said an excited Garcia after European victory.
He gave his witness to his fellow countryman John Ram, who managed to defeat the American legend of the Tiger Woods golf for 2&1 in the individual Sunday party.
"It's incredible how proud I feel today that I could have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, 14 major winner, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems all weekend not to get out of the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf all over the tournament.
The U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning for a moment they made it difficult for the Europeans.
We fought.
I took my hat off before Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go ahead.
I want these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
It's to remove the hat.
They were superior."
