Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
The second reading of the draft amendment to reduce penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently in prison, was rejected by Members of Parliament.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having concluded a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court is to decide on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the judgment of political revenge of the regime and has caused a process of suspicions of bias of the court also to the west.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve.
Libyan victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already won.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winner remains to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but if they are moderate or radical.
The Interim National Council has decreed the usual law of Charia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a theft we cut hands.
Women can forget the emancipation, the potential non-respecters of the faith are liable to the death penalty...
It is the Koran who will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society made up of opposite tribes.
In Libya it will rule such an order as we cannot represent it and as we would certainly not love it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and would probably not benefit Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted help with recognition from unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who directed the strikes of NATO but rather Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every attack.
When it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it
We took part in the shooting, served Islam and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any benefit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not deal militarily with Libya.
So there is no problem for the premises to get rid of "croised".
Without land occupation, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of protection of human rights.
Little by little that we prevent these charia fans from doing so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eye of investors.
A statistical tornado passed on Tuesday over Europe.
Each of the states has published GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czechia and other European countries published their economic development visions earlier for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
The two countries changed data for the second quarter in which Germany was better placed than expected (a rise of 0.3% instead of 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was a matter of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that it is moving towards a gradual decrease in economic growth.
The results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0.5% according to planned and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to what analysts had planned.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2%.
Performance over 10 years is 28.45%
The yields of the obligations of Spain and Italy are rising to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The yields of the Czech bonds remain below 4% while the situation worsens in the region.
Votes were heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the last instance guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super-Cech and the custodian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also defended a good deal of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second part.
Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure up to the second part due to a specific Czech defence.
The vicitms of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of marking a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams found it difficult to mount combinations and the game concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers did not reach the Czech defence which answered precisely the long shots even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human shield
A few hundred students from higher schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in this way in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Ispahan have created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre in Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They have thus openly stated that they would defend their country's nuisance programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iranian nuclear institutions is reported in Israel.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: don't eat breakfast and take the tank for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren will weigh above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have a unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important is the environment in which the human being and the models around it evolve.
On the tables of obese children, for example, there is 50% more carcuterie than in normal weight families.
19% of the obese had dinner fries according to the survey carried out with awareness-raising action "Obey isn't a chance"
In small families sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and attended 900 primary school students in Czechia.
It was the second edition of "Obeyance is not a chance", supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 students from sixth to third have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or obese children is the absence of a proper diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch-eating- dinner, which is a basic principle of good food," says one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and dinner charcuerie
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have healthy development you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czechia, only 23% of students' families eat at the same time.
In most families each takes his breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been raised is that one tenth of the population don't have breakfast at all.
Yet breakfast is the basis of good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in obese children's families, unhealthy fries are more often consumed.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sugar every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children asked make sport regularly, but for parents it's only half, 15%.
Prepare your food.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food on the basis of opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age are far from ideal in terms of healthy diet."
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is in particular a great preference for sweet lemonades," is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch are the pasta that took the first place just in front of the white meat.
Children did not want to be fertilized at all, and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Head of Health
The survey also showed that children are prepared to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a review of a group of participants in the survey who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obviousness is not a coincidence", a determined desire to go to a healthy diet was observed," the results of the survey.
The most significant was for example in relation to sweet lemonades because children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often put white meat and fish on the questionnaire as a main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of breadmeal or potatoes flour).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little upset because there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the dress of the characters and a seminar on what's going on.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we approach final reviews and the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "bought".
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) treated how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, no particular curve, another one of the overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically reduce wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have come to highlight the character beautifully and also not to dress too prominently of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and tight hips and a fine size.
If there is, for example, a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that skirts or trousers do not pass at all, that is worth making it custom.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slides continuously, rolls and does not hold to the waist and so on.
For those who have a male appearance they can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of sewing fabric, or even embroidery.
Of course there are many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that because of what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each trainee received a celebrity to wear for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode and its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, which you may know about Victoria's Secret campaign.
At the bottom of my mind, I am pleased because it is better than to dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred kilos lately (don't take my statement, svp, completely serious) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physics but creates, for example, productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, cloaks, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphicist, has kept us from all this.
But that... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday session, filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka Mode graphicist and Ben Rinc, Mode photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist can work with one dress differently.
The variability is for this primary example.
As for example, this trench-coat that must have been dressed in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with scarves and take it in as a dress.
Or it is enough to go up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with that," he said.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start to contravene," said Jakub.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more clothing variants than those that are photographed.
In other words, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (including a dozen models) I must be ready to "refill" at least a fortnight.
And also, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count on this in the course of a model creation.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In Chechnya, the approach to the use of stylists' services remains frivolous.
And the known faces sometimes consider them useless (it's enough that I know something but what I look like goes to second place).
And if someone gets a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he tells us with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one he actually has.
Then we only have to navigate on the google and make sure that the boulevard info reports the celebrity in question, whether it is thin or big, etc.
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday's heart that it's not enough for the stylist to steer in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he wears and it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not brag, keep their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out his wardrobe and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything out and tell him, My God, what a horror."
"You'll find some things you'll find pretty and he you'll advise on what to wear them," said Mario.
It has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It's the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, depilation rollers or even feeding pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which we close a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not usable because they could break the clothing) or a sewing kit.
So that we were not just people who listen but who tried something in a practical way, they taught us how to resemble shoes properly.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could sink, to forteori outside.
And so we caught and caught.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to get hurt inadvertently.
Skills are therefore really needed.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The counting I'm reporting is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course
I increasingly begin to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run fights across America.
By Way of Review
Originally, a smooth race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
This fills up to a certain extent the ambition of each one, but it doesn't do anything if no one wants to do anything more.
The new sub-titled part The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old race series Need for Speed and get out of some kind of game from playable parts that would not only count on points.
We were therefore curious how the passages added during which the main hero came out of his car and did what he wanted.
As already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different than expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games, but the whole thing pulls down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible pheasantism on the part of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are taken in the adventure whose main hero Jack has character issues and to solve them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the steps planned in different environments that are quite distinct from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for one moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are pretty overcroit although the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
It's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are also approved from time to time with a typical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall upon you.
In addition to this, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There is only a small number but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to overcome the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then you run against the watch (double classic with the chronometer) and then you're still waiting for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make your situation difficult.
Newness is the out-of-vehicle passages.
It's rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by hitting the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are less times of this kind than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is well because this element is not likely to interfere and, in the context described above, is placed in the elements that please the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that at present there is nothing extraordinary, but it cannot be said to be negative.
With regard to realistic simulation, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although we can find the driving model better in concordance, it works very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a certain period of time.
With the difference of the driving model, the collision model is not yet in place.
We do not expect this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have, in a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it is not completely good.
During tight overruns you touch each other sometimes slightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy volts.
Or you'll find yourself in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really bothers you.
The reboot is done so that when you have broken the figure or you have gone out into the decor the game brings you back to the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't go the way it should be, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarts don't help and you need to find the solution by remembering the piece of route in question.
The big part of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be passed in a certain way or that does not happen.
Otherwise you meet on a particular location of "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What angers are the situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in reverse direction and when you arrive, you either need to stand aside and turn them around or hold them off.
It's equal if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes close to your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
All the time of the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without caring about the time, and you still have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This pisses the most at the end of the game when you drive on a long bridge in reverse direction.
The opponent must be in front of you at all costs.
When it passes before you it hides the view of other vehicles in reverse direction and you come into collision many times.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car in the course of the race.
You need to pay attention to gasoline pumps on the routes because you can change there by car however most of the time you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for right highways and super exotic sports cars on very technical roads, for example on laccia roads in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are racing in particular places you know about adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest driver level, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog function that compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (like it) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (like it).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a metro line that sends you the car directly to the scrap metal.
In writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone actually thought about creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What's bothering is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not keep level and in some cases tragically.
This concerns especially accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer useful for you.
The sound part is good and the track is at the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young audience, a new sound track was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could safely say that it is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it is not finished.
The fun is really good but prepare yourself for the mistakes to tap into your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
The Velvet Students in concert with the Choirs of Charles University
The Festa Academica festival offers for the third time festivals that link the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs of high schools and secondary classes.
The festival's nail consists of two concerts organized on November 17.
Charles University has an important part in this festival.
"Among the choirs there is the Choeur of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Humanities, in the festival committee sits the rector Vaclav Hampl", says the head of the team organizing Jakub Calou.
The festival's nail is the concert of the Choeur des lycées et classes, which takes place with free entrance on November 17, starting at 2 p.m. on the space in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening the concert "Students of Velvets" takes place in the premises of the National House in Vinohrady during which the choirs of the upper schools and that of Charles University occur.
The aim of the Festa Academy is not only to celebrate with dignity the International Student Day and to recall the 22nd anniversary of the Velver Revolution, but also to present to the public a choir music of the highest level and develop the creative cooperation of young people.

The program also offers high-level concerts, mystical meetings, student encounters and other activities.
Interested people will find all information on the festival's web pages www.festaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs act like negativists and Euroseptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between institutions"
"I didn't expect such a tough war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," Miléna Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech Ambassador near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different bodies of the EU and their relations in such a understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers at Charles University's Faculty of Law could envy her, she showed how much she took her motto "understanding and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Ms Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning they echoed the criticisms that it is ugly, that it is a round-haired, that it cannot fulfill any mission and I must say that it has cut the breath to everyone because it plays its role in perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of leadership to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?", therefore as an important step towards the unity and greater legibility of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our syrecky (sweet cheese that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also reported on the agenda she has lived, lived and will live in a time close to the European Council.
It qualified the Czech Presidency as a success two years ago.
The Czechs resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It described the fall in governance as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to Mrs. Ambassador, "activism has fought its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself now.
Moreover, the new seventh budget of the Union must be approved, which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and for savings, which sector will be given priority, which countries will help the most, at least, all is to resolve in future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a understandable Europe".
"I really do not like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornichons, bananas differ in size or even if no one has forbidden us to do syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, Czechs have the reputation of being Euroseptics and people who only see things in their negative aspects more than positively.
It is also sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault is, in her view, with several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish came to me, the Magyar, the Slovak, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group of Visegrad doing?"and he is not happy at all."
Mrs Vicenova said that in the near future these are tough new rules on budgetary policy that are awaiting the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at several speeds, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the enhanced cooperation institute."
First of all, it was said that the countries that want it and those who do not want it remain in their place."
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a really two-speed Europe," Mrs. Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis for all themes having an impact on the EU to be discussed among all EU members and not only the members of the eurozone.
History of a trade mark:
Innovator IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as close as possible, the closest one would be "long term".
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been one hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved so little that people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the footprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the company's culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it remains faithful to its core values and yet it was not afraid to change all others around it.
This allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more," the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano announced for the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees such as Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only first American employees to have paid holidays, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commercials.
Similarly IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The society was at the beginning brilliant in the discovery of talent- as one of the first companies to have abolished all forms of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
It has been at IBM for 30 years and is currently in the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years IBM has done what is called jamy, brain-storming online from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the company's internal and external image that provides it with a safe position in the business field.
"Since the beginning of IBM had a rather institutional concept than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard Economics School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems by using its technology," said Georgre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiarly known to the United States with regard to its slogan - in one hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is of course the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, service at server product level up to nanotechnology.
It has numerous patents from all American technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.
His findings include, for example, the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the floppy disk.
IBM met this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it passed away in 1996 Microsoft.

Not all innovations and manufactures were preferred by the client and the time - IBM for example did not succeed in betting on a OS/2 own operating system, the Prodige online service or the PCjr IBM computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the forward movement you cannot emotionally stay stuck on the past," noted Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike for example the Microsoft concomitant that at the base is held and remains under Windows operating system.
A perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a dominant place.
However, in 1990 it was with more than the strongest motivation for participation in hardware.
As of the year 2000, IBM sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of perspective technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its investment volume.
Did IBM now appear to go through the current crisis without being worried?
The IBM share price increased by 120 percent from 2008 onwards, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
For this reason, we can expect this flexible giant to control other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it had initially the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the merger of four companies whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 presided over the Society's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then cast shadow on the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that so far rest the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the kusqu' firm in 1952.
IBM, as his name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - from cheese and meat shearers to registered boxes.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, turnover increased to up to $9 million and the expansion of the firm began in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership his son occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, the people and computers of IBM helped NASA to guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of advice and services with a high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded IBM in the last three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent exploitation of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and management of cities.
In the area of IBM trade, a "Smart Commerce" platform has recently developed which helps commercials manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
She created her branch office in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also the global research and development team that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
Only it could not wait and have established clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova took refuge in Bartosova in the summer, she did not doubt that her couple would not.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving away from Ricany, Pepa did not push back the singer.
And he publicly confessed that he loved him.
Over time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's bond and ended up saying good-bye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separates there will be no wife to welcome her on the steps of the door of the house.
"He's my son's biological father and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my old ass loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova allowed to filter by showing that she has separated herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door isn't a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife has set up a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we're discussing completely normal but we're not sleeping together," Rychtar said for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in knowing where she's going, who and whether she's connected.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take all responsibility on myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Is that also relevant to you?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, like each other, are able to get them out of "their sleeve".
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of female vices that come to pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchases
Does your half make you remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you need to buy at least one clothing a week?
Are you happy to buy and buy packages at the time of the balances?
In your case you can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women believe that they should restrict their passion for buying.
But you will say, which would resist the bottle-drying of clothing stores, to look for pretty clothes for yourself and then try them all in cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he's waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"Would I need to weaken at least five pounds - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Do these phrases not remind you of anything?
Yeah?
You are therefore one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partners are always complaining about their appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and women become poisonous.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite drive.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the soil, make the dust, clear the bathroom - and that twice a week.
You make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children they have dirty the sink, pasted the window of the living room, and that gives you a lot of work?
If you are suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that there is no need to exaggerate and that order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire of cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of the sap
"Put that worn overcoat into the trash."
"Are you going to put those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this work on your partner this way several times a day, you're really going to decompose it.
It is obvious that you do not think badly that you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much sap work...
Defamation, Persifling
Defamation, persiplation, but also insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and are therefore happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us lets escape a little harmless persplexing here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflate, even despise others and are for their surroundings - especially at work in a group of women - especially dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
Hockeyist attacker Jagr twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL Monday game on Caroline's ice and is again leading productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who still made an extra pass and was appointed the best player of the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also recorded two goals during the game.
Jagr after the game told extra-Atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game he'd give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you" explained Jagr after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first Flyers shot.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the pallet and presented it to the composer Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belongs to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," said Jagr.
Caroline did a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a penalty shot she ended with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read hasn't dropped off any other complications that end up in two against one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I took speed and (Read) left to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the final goal of the game from his Voraquek's point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory in the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montréal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out in second grade due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
Candiens did not face an experienced defender their two-button advance lost after a 2:3 penalty shot.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
That's the fact that the back line was sick that mostly bullied the local coach rather than lost fists because they only played the game with 5 defenders.
"It's null."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement over replacement was not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits," he added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender, took part in the thirtieth Winnipeg attack and the victory on Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the jets goals, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
The travel agencies at that time offered trips mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a western inclination and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter or the individual journey was not authorized.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the west, however, it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't yet won.
The agreement for currencies which was the condition for traveling to the west was denied to people "politically incorrect" who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasted until now.
Czech travel has since experienced a great revolution in 1989.
Although until 1989 the holiday in East Germany and Bulgaria was at most, Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world.
The great paradox we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The removal of visas in the 1990s in neighbouring western countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks were not able to travel by plane to the west for a long time that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, in Paris travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our revenues did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at this time to take with itself its own canned food, sausage, etc... to save money.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which finally allowed our tourists after decades of freely buying Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average wage have increased what caused another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel, travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter links that have greatly reduced the costs compared to what was before.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs had visa-free links with virtually most developed countries around the world except the EU which later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year and every year direct air charters have taken Czech tourists to the far hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development arrived in 2008.
on 17 November 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to settle completely in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, also Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for vacation abroad, including attached charges.
The General Assembly must find its President but this could end with a situation without a solution "a bed"
Almost 5 months already the Czech football is without President and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek to the head of the Czech Republic Football Association will not yet be known after a General Assembly to take place in Nymburk on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting rules should be made.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the year after Hasek the football returned backwards to differences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a question of dealing with the way to choose.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only statutory representatives, as well as fully empowered officials.
At this single point, there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the State and Law Bureau as well, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences in the rules for the election continue.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also done nothing to the situation
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nevralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round to avoid falling into the bed.
"The apple of discord lies in the following: whether to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda that represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, the third round of candidates who have received the highest percentage vote in the chamber for which he is a candidate shall be won.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to retire to win the candidate who has received the largest percentage of votes from the two chambers.
And the Czech side is considering the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would cause the idea of two previous rounds to be lost, and this would completely refuse the two-cameral concept," Svoboda admits, which includes the objections of the Moravian side and according to which it would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even if he believes that the settlement of elections based on the most advantageous status Pelta among all candidates.
"I wish to vote as much as possible in accordance with the statutes of the association."
"For there is not yet any dark ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has mainly been defined against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, there will be a new President in Nymburk and he believes that candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification at the European Championship today should calm everyone down."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation" adds Jablonnek's officer who, among the three, has the greatest experience in the management of football both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are trends in changing the design regulations."
"It can cause a blockage again at the General Assembly."
"I hope the healthy reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but which can tell whether the entire course of football will be complete for the game.
The special chartered flight in which they were to travel to Podgorice, among other things, Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take a part of the executive committee on the ground of reprisals.
At the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be crucial.
The Minister for Youth and Sports Education Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parts within the country's strongest sports association and to bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the footballer leader of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly that the profile would have responded to everything he requested for a new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association (AFRT) he would not be put into the campaign for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I don't run into the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik to the Czech Press Agency (CTC).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from gaining access to the head of the AFRT that would be given priority for this election.
Paclik also stresses that in the event of his election, he would hold this post as President only until 2013 as scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would well see in the function an experienced and high-level manager who is not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said to be particularly embarrassing is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of the renowned contravening who is known in the backstages as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to occupy this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-flight merchant, it would be even less favorable to football," proclaimed Paclik.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago while listening to him in an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta got out without any punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes president, I sell Plzen's club."
In the event that Paclik triumphed at Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had finished with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to introduce himself, for example, as head of representation."
"But as an association manager he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew great attention to the cancellation of the Committee of Arbitrators with Ludek Macella that replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to run private companies and he has also been leading Plzen's club since last year, which has celebrated with his support last May his first division triumph.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and bring it a certain culture."
"I would curb the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," said Paclik, who does not seek his antipathy for the head of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose power to lobby with high-level policies would allow more money to be obtained for sport from gambling tax.
"This is one of the key points the new President should deal with."
"If it's about gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current link with Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the President of AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again connected with Jablnek and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"That's not the ideal."
I don't see any reason to pass on my actions from Plzen's club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," said Paclik.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT which should end bed situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the Miroslav Pelta Presidency promised that if he was elected, AFRT would have new statutes that should put an end in the future to complaints about the settlement of elections.
Jablnek's grievor is before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believes that today's success in football performance should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the election of September that did not take place has rightly promised to devote itself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and are waiting for a President to be there on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the lead of the Association," he adds, but it is primarily related to the Jablonec club, worked for many years at the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of the Statutes were approved that were not perfect as everyone noticed."
"If there weren't all these various interpretations, we would have had a President since September," says Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took all the attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take him as a personal mission and am ready to take on all his responsibilities if it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," said Pelta.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He had previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his legal training and that he well knew that his opponent-candida would be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, and instead he keeps criticizing Pelta.
"He's evolved in football for a year and has already had some success."
"But his attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent, but he remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the competitions of the lowest level to the national representation.
It's supposed to be a football vicar.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that begin with the Bohemian one or the result of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for the entire football," the Czech Press Agency told CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment at the head of football would not lead to any change in people.
"I should get to know all employees," he told Strahov where there is a understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for anything.
"If there is only one point of disagreement about how to vote on the third round we will be able to overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and will only get it when there's a new leader in his head," as Pelta optimistically states two days before the day probably decisive for his career as a grievor.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Republic Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday this would not please many people, it seems.
However, Rajchl promises that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a successful youth football."
"But I don't say that I'll do all this alone," said Rajchl in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute skills within the Executive Committee to ensure that each member is in a given area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions for football to take a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticize others," he added.
He said he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth the blow and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in the wheels and put doubts on each of my actions," he explained why he hesitated.
"Many people have told me that I must not give up because they would also give up."
"This trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, we say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the last two years, there has been a great deal of real work and I don't want to let it go."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them.", he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does not return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in a systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him are people who would play football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen."
"We can blame me for a number of things, but certainly not for supporting any one."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to play football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he again confirms that he would be only a President for Czechia.
"And if anyone says otherwise, I'm ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts into one Czech and the other Moravian whose winners would find themselves in the first division."
"There would be no situation like at present with only three mortal teams in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel support from the Czech House that elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be success," said Rajchl, who plans among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, contracts negotiations with televisions and the gaming law.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has what to offer to football.
"No one can question Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he was elected he would surely continue in what has been started by Hasek and would not make any significant change among people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to ruin his success," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.

Omni-optic paddles, beautiful pools of Budapest: Who travels across Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his weary legs rest in gaseous water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Spreaded on her back in the water, she watched the artistically arranged dolls, and swimming against the marbles Putten that waited for her from the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the Art New meticulously restored of these converted pools.
If she enjoyed a indoor swimming pool, she would quickly note all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the historian of Meder architecture and have presented them in his book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The covered municipal swimming pools of Münich, the historic bathroom palaces in the black forest, "concrete buildings Hardcore" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real fervor of bathing culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in sport but he feels attracted to water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swim supporters should simply look at blue tiles and accommodate the javel water pontoon while the players breathe from the scent that smells of spicy forests or can listen to the grazing of the park's joyous birds.
"I wondered one day why the pools must in fact always be so ugly," said the viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful bathrooms."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dip in a pool and volatile sauna oils - a wellness factor in swimming rooms are enormous because all senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically double: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springline.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives a desire to jump into blue.
The Collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Alongside the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (bain of cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a bath of thermal baths with pools filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and found in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zürich bath we have the whole city in his eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can see the animation on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background rises the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the scent of Javel's water does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate from a smell of sulphur, from the Harpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekscsaba emits a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to find in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon binds you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During his search for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool in the open air of Czechoslovakia, she was in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bathroom designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
By taking a look at the new art building window in yellow-white red, she observed the development of weeds among tiles.
It observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; we can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its design in 1844 but also a maori hall in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it originated from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance to melt construction styles if different in such a formidable unit," said Meder.
With such a palace, the dive into the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon speculation about raw materials?
According to SPIEGEEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group leader then wants to draw on the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions to break down this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann points out that the speculation of global raw materials in the stock exchanges, increases prices upwards and that banks share a complicity with global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign concretely aligns itself with the head of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, the majority of experts share the view that betters have seconded themselves from offers and demand - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from U.S. competitors: He promises to investigate the charges and says, "No case is worth jeopardizing the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, as usual.
At the end of January, the Bank's head will indicate the consequences.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
The leader of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how today's banks are damaging to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be especially under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation," said Bode.
"That doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about the hungry people or whether the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may appear at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the group's CEO wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his duties.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is foreseen in the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with a abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And as for possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will care about.
One in two would terminate investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
To date more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which on November 7 and 8, the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just 11 percent found this legitimate because Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many bank clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one out of two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into speculations on raw materials.
43 per cent would advise such a bank around them, 49 per cent replied that they would think about the termination of their account to change bank facilities.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with tops, bottoms and a Happy End: the Austrian Pavilion for the World Exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then collapsed.
Now it is open again and takes place in the exhibition house.
If you are excited about a modern post-war architecture, its clear forms, its glass hangars, its lively and daring looks, and its new building materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to date.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous internationally in 1973.
His flag project as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the station of southern Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
But it has been used so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and become increasingly weak.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, he now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be in the future used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the museum Belvedère opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance at all points of view.
The new departure was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedère.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things, in his youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, she has carried out in particular the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she has obtained public funds and private sponsorship and has established its exploitation.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name were exhibited, a coffee shop and a bookstore are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and sensibly expanded Joseph Olbracht's secession and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his travel to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a gouffre in energy," says Krischanitz.
Glass facade window profiles were changed, glass insulating glass reinforced glass fibers was placed and roof replaced with a particular safety glass.
The thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a light panel slammed between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge led to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but always the light Pavillon Schwanzer.
The exterior doors of origin have remained, the house is painted in a shade against red-brown rust.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision by the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"There are many materials that are good and inexpensive to be found, and which also please the Office of Monumental Protection," said Krischanitz, and he draws attention to a gross ground in the basement.
Despite all constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands the "quarter of the central station" just yet planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance may occur: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art centre, and as it is said, it already negotiates with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a massive winter crisis in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported in advance invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of about 300 million euros would be planned by 2015.
This should also allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snowing of railway facilities and docks should, inter alia, double and increase to 16,000.
The objective is to clear the decks from snow and ice up to the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment required for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Chief of Station Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter, the railway society had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because there was a lack of reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For many years, many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing what it has been doing for years, since it has to have the axles of the ICE trains checked more often at the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE in the central train station in Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is news in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not enough already, the past of this giant in the sector also caught him in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison to $145 million (EUR 106 million), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator brings to large banks a whole series of accusations, and this has encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution in this regard, without the parties initiating proceedings in court," said a contact from Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank did not recognize any errors in comparison.
This is also true for Citigroup, which has committed itself to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy in order to protect customer deposits.
NCAU is trying to repair the damage incurred by several billion dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks aside and in summer he assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents, it is "Death-backed Securities".
Credit homes are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, it is currently blowing a storm wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have resorted to numerous remedies to seek redress or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 large international banks, the two US-owned real estate finnie Mae and Freddie Mac for taking advantage in nature in mortgage business of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file an appeal with FHFA, here are several operations of a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005-2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without quoting a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and declared itself willing to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests colossal amounts in the IT company of IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett has constantly explained that he is investing in IT IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad predictions.
However, he read IBM reports and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier than IBM primarily offers services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
Accordingly, the IT IBM activity is granted the right to now be known as "Mr. IBM".
Car Buffett revealed today at the CNBC economic issue, that he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM never knew anything about this commitment until now.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time put on IT-profit services as a "exploitation of accounting centres".
The computer pioneer, aged over 100, offers both Software and consultation as well as highly performing business calculators.
Buffett has so far avoided technology companies.
He says he invests only in the companies he understands business.
But on the contrary, Buffett attacks rather the railway, lubricant manufacturers or machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares with a wide range of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rück municipality.
In the 1960s, this 81-year-old had resumed the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and set it up as one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money earned him the nickname of "Omaha Oracle".
Following Buffett's investment announcement IBM shares increased by one percent to the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also called IBM, has a stock market value of over 220 billion dollars and has Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would be reborn now.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish people react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks the spectrum that had long been believed to be dead again appeared: since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this extreme right-wing context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been asked.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions of which the dimension is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology", "Tel was the title of the publication on the Internet of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the very right-wing bubbry.
The Turkish community in Germany has rightly reacted: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence in front of Brandenburg's door.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish Berlin community and German and Turkish policies had thought of a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a gif: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of univocal conditions.
"it starts at puer", which is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He stressed that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to Germany's reconstruction through their work.
Police action was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why has it not already come much earlier to the minds of the German authorities to do research in certain suspected extreme right environments, the authors are surprised.
More than one shows itself ready at least to rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the matter continues to be broken, nothing else remains for migrants except self-defence and armament."
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Inland peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What this means if inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after Solingen's fire is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has more clearly shown to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance through acts of violence could result.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes
At one time it was mainly the failure of German politics after attacks by the Turkish press: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of the Turkish State, he was represented at the funerals in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel had at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how much the mistrust of many German-Turks is deep towards the state of local law since that date.
In addition to further clarification and re-evaluation of extreme right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and skating from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After its spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was known in July, that it would occupy an almost as spectacular position in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Great Swiss Bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber has publicly welcomed and welcomed Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently obtained solidity and has made pleasant comments on future colleagues.
"The U.B.S.B. has succeeded in the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, from September on it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities merchant in London had diverted all the Bank's security systems and had ignited about €1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has been considered suffering since - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank as of February 2012.
And he will resume the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economy and President of the bank, and he would certainly need a period of adaptation.
At the same time he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank".
In fact, the UBS is on the one hand - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also rude, had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a very large bank in the area of banking investment.
So the UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later a bank professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken the UBS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, one wonders: how could I have simply been wrong at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something didn't turn around at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising manner, which was so far regarded as a top intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later we heard why he left.
The division of the bank had burned with subprime documents and had to cross billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross over.
For this, she found investors, but which, a short time before, would have rubbed the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian background from Singapore and an Arab background, which was passed under silence, to the extent that his name was never even heard.
But that was only the first time.
In April 2008, this got worse.
The bank was to announce again losses amounting to billions, and the president of the Marcel Ospel board, who was still the second most paid board in Switzerland in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was in the financial crisis prior to bankruptcy and must be saved by the State in view of its investment errors.
The national bank purchased tens of billions of problematic titles from the UBS, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds into shares, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet for UBS 2007 increased to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said the bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second disaster followed.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy clientele, who had cheated the tax maybe with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in reimbursement of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS has published more or less that it has assisted in tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid to tax fraud.
And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as we thought, the UBS would come out of it, it followed from this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single flame market 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something didn't turn around.
And it's published: with risk management in investment bank it still doesn't seem to work.
"In the case of Adobeboli, it was found that the control of risks has not changed too much," said Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the University of Zurich Banking Institute.
So the financial director of a large German bank is sure of this: "the problem of the UBS is that it does not have the control of risks in hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their place, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich is still going to match the strong private Swiss bank cliché - it's just a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its seat at the Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings are here prestigious, shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's, they are found here between Swiss tradition stores as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a great label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other side of the market - or I betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would become too big, is it - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the lives of Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, made high profits and then the breakdown: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of subprime as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"On Wednesday, the small country's government coalition of seven million people has undertaken the greatest rescue operation in their nation's history," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The Fall of the UBS".
With about 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for little Switzerland - and continuously recorded an increase.
What helped was that the two different pre-decessive banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already stronger internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the ascent of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly president of the board of directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has made a way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the head of the Wuffli group always gave the same word: dethroner Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" classifications, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all the U.S.U.S. wanted to go up top.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of currency and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
However, the business advisors, who had responsibility for it, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the bank jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the larger banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS launched into an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
With growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. subprime investments that have invested.
It has become a massive machine that has packaged and sent value documents based on U.S. mortgages - but which has also retained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to go down.
"Even in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was on fire, the U.S.B.S. purchased there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The more euphoria is the greater the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts, it turned out to be harder than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and have so far been bankers.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go so far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as it is clear so far.
Next Thursday the bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Switzerland was only supposed to be transitional when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has been imposed: it must carry out the affairs of the UBS sustainably, the Bank of Zurich reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to progress in the mid-1990s.
He cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has already asked himself.
He says publicly so far only that he was going to look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart horns spread in cities
In many places, brakes are considered "bird problem" but experts claim that these very intelligent animals have not been allowed to chase cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cornelisins have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are multiplied because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first Ostfriesich Symposium on the Cornels, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt the brakes out of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
The nature protectors were also based on the problems of cities on the exodus of specially protected brakes: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional life spaces.
Hunting, setting and slaughtering typical cave trees made life difficult for birds.
The horns are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 couple of coves in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative publicity due to the carnage massacre in the region.
Critics found catching birds in traps and killing them with particularly brutal gourds.
"The normal expulsion, the evidentiary, is useless," noted the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressure water or the trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals go away, the great colonies divide, and they scatter in other places."
The evidence is only imaginable in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of animal embodiment with a reverse conditioning and sticky offers, in order to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "info panels instead of stretchers" in order to establish completely different relationships with the: "We can finally better support a face button with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-roading-educational crows at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing the lives of these very intelligent brakes.
This project was adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There are a great number of communications, these birds have much to say."
The intelligence and ability of animals are legendary: Frews do not only use working instruments to achieve a regal but they themselves manufacture their tools as tools of work.
Ecologists at Cambridge University recently tested four brakes, as far as bird intelligence is concerned.
In an experience, the birds quickly learned that they had to finish a scaffolding with stones in order to reach a larva.
Without much training, they firmly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to break down the platform.
In a second test, the cunning horns were then to solve a more trapping problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds could not reach their goal with their beak.
However, the researchers had put iron wires at their disposal.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four brakes were even successful from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks once remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czechia and Ireland will also participate in the European Championship 2012.
Portugal, Czechia, Croatia and Ireland bought the latest tickets at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and then eliminated Ukraine.
Led by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal moved against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0th of the game, its fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the eliminated return match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) was already an obvious thing.
Nothing was also burning in the zero game 0:0 between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) release against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a hand-held 11-meter penance (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) made a double shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54e).
Bosnia had already failed the World Cup 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free 30-meter hit in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her skills of distance shooting and fired 25 meters away to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to attacker Edin Dzeko.
Ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of the Manchester City English Championship, initiated a headball aimed at the bottom of the cross-bar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33th).
Jiracek drew a goal for Czech
Finally, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian Penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card in Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark granted a penalty of 11 meters played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic likely diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 Europe Vice-Champion succeeded four times and everything became clear.
For Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81th minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had the chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
The goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface just next to the Cech shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the aid of the world class guard of the Czechs already shot down, again, the FC Séoul attacker had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end has finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his seat on the 2002 EM Third Bank, Croats were able to enjoy their fourth round at the end of the European championship.
In the presence of 31000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball for the purpose.
After the time of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62 e Minute, the legionnaires of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM

Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) has equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at higher speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy was given the first chance.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first goal.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of the goal guard Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and will lock the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China

Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and Grief: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that warms your heart.
A tip to start: carefully tear this page down and make your page tag.
You will learn about these people in detail. In this Romanesque story by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a score during these moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here a book out of the ordinary that he accurately described as "an anti-history book."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors or discussions on strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it might look like." There are the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beautiful and sad" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 men and women more or less ordinary, on both sides of the war, from young schoolmen and botanists to escalators, by means of doctors, ambulancemen and salesmen.
Some of them will become heroes.
Others of the prisoners of war. Some will lose members, go crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives waver here like the waxes of a church: while some turn off, new ones come out.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
It makes a lie to the idea that the First World War is summed up only by the terrible war of trenches on the western front.
"Beautiful and sad" describes skillfully other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, the Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the teddy flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina who bears the cordite.
When cannon blows fall away, and you are a mother at home, do you stay or flee?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been permeated by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor from the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are best preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most approach deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere Ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "meat made of cooked rice crushed in the fat of sheep (and finished with a false bone of wood); tobacco made with dried roots and dried skin of potatoes; seeds of wooden footwear."
He states that "837 authorised substitute meat are recorded in sausage production. 511 substitute coffees are also found."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards savagery and says about war: "You feel that after all, it's what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, reading a newspaper or best-seller, and rather than claiming that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your worn shirt and nailed.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we resign to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience," he wrote.
Unfortunately it's rather comparable to "a man convicted secretly."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," wrote Peter Englund, "a war between the factories."
He seizes the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the livestock of the early century: the well-ariculated mass murderer and ideologically convinced, in well-cut clothing, which executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are both basic behaviours and heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a Venetian disease in prostitutes in order to avoid frontal service.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhoea, which soldiers buy and spread over genital organs in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which means a life blindness."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his work of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captured the way in which the war had " triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West nothing new", by Erich Maria Note, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming thing I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come up from his book, grab your hands on this page containing the list of people and burned with a flashlight.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some carrying helmets.
Monday night to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all the exceptions of a few high-ranking officers and others informed from the beginning of an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the department's regulation and generated a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that involve moving a large number of police quickly - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park were reached "at the last minute," said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know and who were called didn't know they would go to Zuccotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones who know they'd go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city has learned to hold a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police wanted to clean up the park, but they were repelled by hundreds of protestors informed of the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood - dozens of officers who were used to special criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going to the park during the day in the way of migrants, so one hour in the morning was a suitable time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The recorded lights and messages of the speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
While community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue windshield, many protesters simply gathered their business and left.
No tent was hit before 1:45 p.m. the Police said, which allowed time for the occupants to assemble their business.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists in the park have been forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson of the chief of police department, said that this measure had been taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention within the park, which was rudely retained by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that TV cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the Police were moving west across the heavy business of protesters, including luggage, plastic grass and sheets filled with clothes, teams of the sanitation department followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services have been called to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 p.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them for "problem in public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most proficient officer to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "he was not running operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were suffering along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We saw the Police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, would have even been seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively actions of the night took place south of the park.
About 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were seen breaking down tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood appeared flying the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The school aid union is pursuing the city for layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school aid lost their jobs last month plans to enter a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schools.
The prosecutions are probably the final weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to get the dismissals canceled.
Six hundred and sixty-two school grants, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the least well-paid in the city, lost their jobs on 7 October. Trade union leaders compared these dismissals to political revenge for not having allowed the city access to a health care fund led by workers' groups, and which would have allowed to close the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this charge.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis Walcott said that the dismissals were part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council replied that the dismissals of school aid were not specified in the budget.
The Council officers of the 37th District stated that they would complete a notice of complaint, warning the education department to be pursued; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions to the Supreme Court of Manhattan State.
Dennis M. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be the defender. The complainants will be represented by eight laid-off workers, all of them of black or Latin American origin, like most of the school aids that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city's legal department, said the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore could not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints from the New York Times, the union sent the number of dismissals in schools in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose most aid due to regular under-financing.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in the institutions of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school grants have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern districts of the Bronx.
Noting the loss of five school grants out of eight employees at Harlem Public School 36, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecutions claim that "This is not a well-off parent district that can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The public school budget 36 has been reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of the additional funding for each underprivileged student enrollment.
The union also claims that school directors may have been misled by certain terms in a memo allowing the dismissal of parents coordinators.
The memo used the term "outside" to describe the action, even though "outside" more generally describes the action of moving a school teacher to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "Six sixty parents coordinators have been fired", and "not just because of overrun".
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on the question of Libya
It would appear that the Republicans and Democrats had finally reached an agreement in the Chapter on the issue of uprising in Libya.
It would have taken a successful uprising, capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Kadhafi as well as the American involvement.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republicain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honour the bravery of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the United States' military role in the NATO mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill has been defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and has never been voted in the Senate.
But on the same day of the failure of the bill, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The American mission therefore remained in the form of legislative purgatory - Congress was sufficiently upset to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under foot.
The indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO's mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations " congratulates the Libyan people on their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and " congratulates the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their partners in the coalition engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as in June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Richard D. Lugar Commission (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Chapter, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution in order to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other question, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have not so far been able to make their amendments approved, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - especially the new Republicans who wish to gold their CVs - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, approved last August, called for a vote by the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the limit of two mandates for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is proposed forever, just as the amendment prohibits desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of States oppose it.
As much as the members have been eager to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they used to be.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 amendments at the 110th Congress.
The trend slows compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacre but not batute" says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him at the end of Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday night on a television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said she wanted first and foremost to re-establish rather than return to Congress.
On his appearance in the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return after the bullet that fractured his skull and penetrated the left side of the brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first interview with television since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified his recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords replied, "First of all."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place in a special edition of an hour of "20/20", broadcast on the eve of the release of the new couple's book entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special show tracked the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting on January 8.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he was spotted on his hospital bed, shaved head and a wide scar on the forehead.
She can only use one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragements.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords was sitting in a wheelchair while doctors taught her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: is the representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with the doctors, said not to remember the shooting.
According to her husband, she was reading an article on the March 12 shooting when she stopped her and asked for the first time for information about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There were a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
At his recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been slaughtered.
And you're going to get out of it, get back and get back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for troops
The event: a gala at Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for homeless veterans from New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie suit stood at his feet to claim it.
"The military, both men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of spring fundraising.
A senior military officer in the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as some sort of orphan," wrote the military high school in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they declare a few soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us up in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the fight with the Marines, retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they have been confronted with insurgents and have traveled to distant borders.
Others would wonder whether "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who had given him interviews asked in a subtle way whether he would be able to keep up with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you address the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely welcomed by a country that is so unfamiliar with the army and which sees little direct advantage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II," said retired lieutenant general David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
The troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The Army in the face of increasing pressure from rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to court against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare their next.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant 11 weeks on the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She would return to her barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a beer pack.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"C" was an alarm signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane put aside her concern.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught him from behind, threw him on the ground and raped, she pretends.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still on duty and others not, will eagerly await the judicial decision at a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether a trial against the former secretary to defend Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, the trial started with 17 complainants.This number rose to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and they also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says he takes the galloned military, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future prosecutions.
Her strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, led by US lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a decision of the Supreme Court of 1950, called Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries caused by staff in active service.
"The alleged wrongdoing is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicates the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to fight, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male only.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
As a result of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat situations.
It is time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in carrying out this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Centre prepares a case against the four main military academies for having so-called encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of "personal disturbances" attributed to victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group tried a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons who claim to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were registered according to the Department of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The March report also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of the cases recorded in the army were tried - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the rape police less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to report 11 times in detail her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her aggressor - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat in front of a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six individuals testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who eventually became acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was rendered," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions.
"I was placed in psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commander, "It wasn't his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was referred under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any advantage.
Whether Lyman or other complainants will move forward, it's a long story, says John Turley, professor of law at the University of Washington Faculty of Law.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is standing behind decades because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence as it does.
"The chances are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he says.
These things change only when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will bring together hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy with his anti-immigration opinions online.
Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged having been taken from a murderous folly in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time prior to the attack on his computer, to discuss with a few of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how can I find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so many personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific precision - the way marketers have done it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to an investigation. Questions related to their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interrogate 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: the online supporters of the right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those that associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The study of DEMOS is just an example of how Facebook has become the new and indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and polytologists use the site to study all subjects that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I like", publications on walls and updates of statutes.
With more than 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, the "supernova of data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose site name appears in the title of almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their drunken exploits had a lot more chance of being alcoholic than those who were discreet about this.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as counsellors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly assist a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children's Health, Behaviour and Development at the Research Institute for Children in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The data team studied the statistics on the situation of Valentine's Day, the rate of participation in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they have not even heard?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, it is something else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things," says Neil Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and a pen remain the best tools to use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer."
"Froid and Inhuman" : first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Temples of Norway," he explains in front of a audience room filled with 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I welcome it because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, speak to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondences for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in hopes to look Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be placed behind the bars.
Everyone participated in the hearing to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor on the Norwegian NRK television channel.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at the journalists and survivors in the eyes by entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore appear to be the work of an extremist rather than of an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some of them.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred him to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing himself from the technical engineering and inventor of modern computer technology.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recent Steve Jobs interview that will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how creative this spirit understood the processes and workflows of products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an improved organization chart - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease leaving them to think that a brilliant idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series depicts the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the interview with Crygely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a complete video was found in the director's garage.
This slightly edited video is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast to the cinema on Wednesday and Thursday next.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems amazingly enthusiastic here to expose technological philosophies and its commercial strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism is resurging, where he seems to be looking forward to hearing Cringley's questions, giving him a hand in order to speed him up and move on to more important questions or subjects.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strange aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he views as good or bad in other companies and reveals his own vision of the future of computer science.
It's one thing to read Steve Jobs' posthumous career evaluations, but there's something gross and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
It has a vision of how things can and must be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven outstanding Lost Interview sequences:
On how he learned how to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked: 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by detailing his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Perplexing about how the costs were recorded - we often start with a "standard cost" assessed for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated factory that ensured the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour to the Pope:
Steve Jobs recounts the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and telephone free of charge in long distance.
The apparatus has been the subject of many prior writings, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in its description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, passing a call then connecting from an AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped up the ball of different things a half a dozen times and you screamed on the public phone and it came to you a minute later on the next public phone," explains Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we ourselves could create something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much either, but we knew how to invent a little thing capable of controlling big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever exist without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night, turning to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the US diplomat, the two accomplices are going crazy just before the Pope himself is awake.
On his love of technology (and departure from Bill Hewlett):
At 12 years of age, at the spare parts hunt to make a frequency meter, he looks for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and passes him a wire.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first ever designed desktop computer."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a little cathode tube. I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several times in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about making new products on a headstroke.
At the beginning of his career, while he moved in to sell some printed circuit board cards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he should take care of assembly and delivery of finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalled difficulties in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... I was screaming at myself, claiming it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that would be incredibly reliable.
On large companies that are suffering from:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders were going to cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's admit that you worked at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copyr or a better printer, and after?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can evolve it, so [these types of people] that end up leading companies and specialized product personnel are set aside from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have made ten times her current size. Xerox would have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They took the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge piece of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, plants too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and that great artists want.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
It is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas eat with health law opponents while the court meets
On the day the Supreme Court meets in private to consider the question of political discord, namely whether the opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were observed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question involved a trial by 26 states challenging the reform of ambitious health care voted by Congress last year, a law that was a rally point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5h30 is expected in March, and the result will probably be in a position to encourage the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be on the rise at the time the court decision is made.
The lawyer who will be held before the court and will argue about the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as general solicitor of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The Legal Office of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen cabinets who helped sponsor the annual meal of the Federalist Society (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial challenge in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, the top Republican of the Senate and a declared opponent of the Health Act.
The guests star at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federal Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may assist in collecting funds from law-related organizations and others although the judge may not be an intervener, guest of honour, or on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the lawyers' offices of the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was sufficient to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court complies with the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"Judges were drinking and eating and collecting gala funds with lawyers who have cases in court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event demonstrates any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little respect for the criticisms that they say they mix court affairs too easily with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a conservative high profile activist.
Furthermore, conservatives claim that Judge Elena Kagan has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general solicitor of Obama's administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the level of the court of first instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she had become too involved in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for line planes
Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, two-way aircraft, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order covering 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is a whole case when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
Just as incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, an increasing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
On Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft in the next 20 years with a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-coordinaters.
It was the Emirates airline based in Dubai that passed this pharaonic command.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also able to purchase 20 more aircraft, which would increase the total order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated Monday that the Oman Air company ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts important fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than $1 billion.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have enormous value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have a lot of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them since the country would earn money with the rise in oil prices.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil increases, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The order of Emirates reinforces Boeing's predominance on the wholesale aircraft market and helps to curb the attempt to upset the competitor Airbus with its A350 plane.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Fair comes four months after Airbus announces to postpone the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus repels its beginnings to increase its growth as a result of its customers' demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing company shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican President clearly fought in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers assisted his opponent Fausto Vallejo of PRI in the race to the governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to access the office of Governor of Michoacán in the course of violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI, was in the lead of the race at the position of governor of that Western State.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officers... they took the polls, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled over Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only recently noticed Calderon, who was at the head of the polls before the day of the election.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, currently serving as governor, has arrived third, a painful defeat before the presidentials of 2012 for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence persisted.
A week before the election a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up locally in the campaign because of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections were aired, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to prepare to help the euro area overcome the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Managing Director of BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growths in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent the long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain point but it is not sheltered."
"So if China and India can help, nothing will stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan is dangerously raised in the arrow and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece resigned.
The growing crisis of sovereign debt in Europe gave rise to the fear that the world economy would go back into recession, and called on the major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag argued that the IMF would provide any Asian aid, but he also stated that bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the United States financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, said "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and a reduction in foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to meet and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutush Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to make Europe accept aid to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live with 2 dollars a day or less.
"One day, they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go on a holiday in the sun and they will have trouble avalancing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many Greek officials well paid in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area could cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
The BASD forecasts of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 are now facing "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "aid plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and significant capital leakages.
Strong Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defence Reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan, through civil gatherings.
The Pentagon already digests $450 billion of reductions for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more compression will be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditures.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from the so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"A reduction that is as significant, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and our inexhaustible construction projects - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," writes Panetta to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians off without pay in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
Reductions could possibly affect combatting troops, continues Panetta.
"Although the funding in wartime of the accounts of contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be adversely affected by serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta said.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support war."
"The staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as an undisputed world leader of the military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," the senators stated in a joint press release Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it certainly is not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
That the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the highest post of the Pentagon accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a hunting plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks at the Pentagon.
"It's a depressed, poorly prepared and incapable of dealing with potential opponents."
"In fact, she calls for aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could " generate important operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage us in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could go to the cutter, including those already tested and some just at the first stages of planning.
This list included the F35 Fighter Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates the extent to which deception and lies are omnipresent in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for the presidency Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were accused of perjuring for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open-ended microphone telling American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The New York Congress member and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, went on to be an idiot by quickly emitting contradictions contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of campaign funding related to the coverage of an extra-conjugal link.
And then, none of those who have experienced history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test responses to students in order to make themselves aware of their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are evil lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that each one must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I have had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a thorough research of such projects, including in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about the lie have been demystified.
The liars look into your eyes.
They don't bet, pray, or they don't always get upset.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation and response time.
I have spent several years reviewing scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate into our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include employment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are skilled at reading others, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - than married people less often lie to their partners than unweds (but the lies they tell tend to be enormous).
We also know that if you are perceived as being a believer, the others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you say if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call setting the benchmarks.
This helps to provide a benchmark to measure subsequent changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, laugh, voice quality.
You need to know if someone usually stirs his feet permanently so as not to throw unfair accusations when you see him handing his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for hints of verbal and nonverbal misleading behaviour.
Consider these signs as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceivers can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards a exit, change their posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions are passed.
Questioners often falsely indicate that the interview ended just to seek to trigger the post-interview response.
Also, be careful about your vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson derailed using the past while claiming that his murdered woman was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceiver individuals can also use a distant language: "I have not had sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a completely difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by breakers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be disbanded after the U.S. threat of late approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of an pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - which provokes the anger of trade unions while soothing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says that it is ready to redirect the project to put it back on track.
TransCanada stated Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, claims that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain the approval of an pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit to the project until it received further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Danubes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, vast underground water sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have rejected any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although the officials denied the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He would transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to Texas refineries.
In order to do so, it should cross six States.
He is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have put on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to this plan insist that a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The ongoing Department of State Environmental Impact Study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation into the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist committed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice from its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to throw up fear
A New York family claims that Disco Patti LaBelle’s diva launched in a riot of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building terrified their little girl to the point where she threw it away in fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened little Geneviève Monk, 18 months old, so much so that she suffered from "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "the increased fear of strangers," said her family during the trial of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10, last year, when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to leave on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the lobby of their Boulevard Riverside building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped by the door and laid her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came after me and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said, "Yes," and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle angryly warned the pregnant woman.
"She told me about an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter by the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "what you say or think doesn't interest me."
It became rooted and began to use oaths - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling from the bottle's water.
She said that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter," says the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who always kept Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surroundings that led her to a car waiting for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so loud that she went to vomit, she added.
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but no response was received.
Lawyer and LaBelle representatives have not returned our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damage, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a motherly teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has curbed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-called for change, which has generated high expectations for economic progress, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in return there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, apart from causing trillion losses for the agricultural sector, have limited the opportunities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6% in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of freezings from the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there have been damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent have suffered partial damage, the main crops were vegetables, maize and peas.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the State's unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year, an accelerated increase was observed, as, from January to March, 55 thousand 053 signals were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, the rate in the second quarter became 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate representing more than 74 thousand unemployed signals, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly by public policy actions.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources approved by the legislation in Congress to combat money-laundering, because for people who make dollars in an illegal way it is not easy for them to work to earn them, invest them and use them in something," he said.
Migration in custody
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because they already have a lot of difficulty in finding work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Serious absence
The analysis of the labour market is worsening by considering the high level of serious lack of conditions that prevail between the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in that state works there without contributing as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of serious benefits, another reason for disengagement for the state is low wages, the entity has lower pay in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED Contraction
Apart from the decrease in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 the highest reduction in the Direct Foreign Investment over the past 10 years was recorded, according to the Economic Secretariat from January to June, the State FDI reached $630 thousand 697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5 million 143 thousand 312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, mainly registered by the tertiary sector companies.
Debt
Given the economic contraction scenario, in July the Government of the State requested approval of a 3 trillion pesos credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, approval of the state congress was 2,600 billion pesos and until November no debt benefits were observed in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For employers' representatives, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the will of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has been really very poor, it is necessary to work intensively to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we need to double our efforts, it has been necessary to align the effort of all and especially the good already synchronized walk of this new government team, hopefully the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slow
Loredo López stated that events such as the early freezing of the year have retained the state economy and have restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, including ice cream, one of the main effects has been a slow economy which does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level and flow in trials, products and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close much below the expectations that we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Oriarte, President of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that we want to channel the state into productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we have the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better channel the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in various areas, in terms of economic development, there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that much has been done and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to be done," he said.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marijuana
A person resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and 100 days' fine for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the small trafficker convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for crime against health, in his variant of marihuana possession for sale.
In accordance with file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on June 7, 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, ahead of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker circulated in a pick-up, white, pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle trunk and on the copilot's place a small backbag where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Enforcement of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts to contributions to books
Social literature reflected in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants may not be finished where to record serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has failed to fulfil its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and until now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is a possibility of delay in their completion.
"They must provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end they have given us nothing, even though since July they had to give us a part," he said, "and we, in order not to record any delays, started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration, the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the 7 million that the government had not provided at that time.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to obtain resources to cover what the State had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment by the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management to ensure that the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end, they haven't given us anything."
The Court valid "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cupour" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been put down for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court can decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft award, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the decree's declaration as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a statutory assignment reserved for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree and to admit complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions planned by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also resolved to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project that Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible for.
In his speech, the Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the preparation of the project.
"I also consider that if I did so, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, who has the constitutional mandate of the government.
Replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years and this results in better exploitation of radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
Adjournment of change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalisation which implies a decision of public interest which not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of a whole system, which, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of powers which the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of Congress in a form, as it ensures in the administrative sphere that the laws issued by the legislature are respected.
An analysis of the possibility of a vote-by-voting count in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total verbatim records.
The possibility of "vote-by-vote" counting is a reality with regard to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total verbatim records.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Institut Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either its Constitution or its Electoral Code of State or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the Congress of the State has approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral trial to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has omitted his publication within the time limit provided for by the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had a few objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state agent for constitutional reforms, as he does not have the right to "sanction or contest them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out the partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be that: the results of the minutes do not match; there is no polling report and the ballot file does not appear in the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all election ballots may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the election is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition by the party representative and/or coalition who presented the second one of the candidates reported.
The total count of the vote may also be held if at the end of the joint count it turns out that the difference between the alleged winning candidate and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express petition by the representative of the political party whose candidate has emerged second, in which case the electoral packages that were subject to the partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His final will
Its ashes will be spread in Zapalinamé's Sierra, confirming the family.
The remnants of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a rest.
According to his family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes be spread in Zapalinamé's sawmill.
After receiving the tributes alongside others who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the lieutenant-colonel's ashes arrived at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends visited.
At 17:30 a.m., he was paid tribute to the Institut Tecnologie de Saltillo organized by his former Bachelor of Technology colleagues and the U.S. football team that was part of Felipe Bacio when he was preparing for the Bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and that his ashes would be spread in Zapalinamé's saw, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she considered himself to be at the fullness of her life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and he cared much for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he was even ill with a truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahaguón to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last goodbye
It was noted with honour that the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, paid tribute to Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Institute of Technology of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, alongside the government secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of the service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the spread of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three bodies abandoned, located in the property of Cadreyta NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes relating to organized crimes.
Three men were found killed with fire fired in different parts of the body and with grace, in an abandoned property of Cadreyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 kilometres from Cadreyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose closure has beige colour and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, approximately three metres away, they located the bodies of three persons, for which they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At one meter away there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were spread over the belly.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been killed in another place, because there were no in situ duis found.
In the closure of the property there were legends directed by one crime group organized towards the other, apart from a few bullet holes in the property and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadreyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating primarily in Cadreyta municipality and who are considered to have relations with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in the first instance, on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, eight persons were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty had been saved.
They were confiscated three buildings and one cell; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, the military personnel made a monitoring course in Rancho Viejo, Cadreyta, by detecting a car without registration plate with two topics on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 p.m., one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadreyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on board the economic disaster
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on board the economic disaster and put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A press release from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats in his majority, even if it is unclear when the new executive takes office.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The frame is now well-drawn, he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, at a shorter time than normally, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has increased its debt costs to levels that cannot be supported.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to move forward, the instability of the markets to place the performance of the Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had been saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronal Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's success opportunities were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the right-wing party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the Government of the majority technocrat that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in his efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy in Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his meeting tour Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, which enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief rest at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt were now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite generalized predictions that politicians would only give it time to implement reforms before the elections were made.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that it should only be trained by specialists, an index of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual distrust and disagreement between parties complicates the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of Spanish people is greater than that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 gathered attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica's, when compared to the 22 countries called for today's friend, at 15:05 p.m., at San José National Stadium.
While national and European champions, the number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a broad register of Class A inter-selection games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Humana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England, keep intense activity in national league and coup championships and fights in European coups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup of Football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have limited international experience in an area, such as Concaf, which is considered to be lower in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goal keeper Iker Casillas, who, on previous Saturday, against England (defense 0-1 in London) has equalized the record of the former goal keeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, brain-flying of Barcelona, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the week before by UEFA alongside the other hundreds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the foreman of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready for the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the editor Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not begin.
The historic editor of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will also become a dream of happening in this country.
It is that the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two decades of work celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day they will meet at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles Group The X and Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican supporters, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I spent only once in Costa Rica; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
We are therefore thrilled to carry our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the group, fans live intensely in the days before.
What is your message for your most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so long had to pass up to this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've been offering over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered two giant shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that this has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really look forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have many friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends were always going surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that is how we learned through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you have offered huge shows, with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What do you owe it to?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone loves different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not interpreted for a very long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes also more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes us very excited.
We love and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunt?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very friends with people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of Seattle's group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we attended a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that arose.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky enough to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other's music and that could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what it has brought, without taking into account the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn't really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first that was great.
We were a group for almost three years and we did not publish a record before Andy died (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration about the fact that it lasted so little and most importantly is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas national group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose him for the opening?
Yes, production has sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer on-line and that must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbeter's words live for?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's the one who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
Some time ago...
Among the first ones I remember is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about bassists that I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunt in spite of the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have emerged at the same time and, if it is relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney now make the best music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change due to?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that look lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, perhaps, represent it for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even so we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori again hospitalized for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for his loss of muscle strength in the feet, informed his family doctor.
72-year-old Fujimori, who served a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he was operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, said for Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasm Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been performed four times with language cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilograms, and other pathologies, such as severe erosion gastritis, pancreas cyst, renal calculus, arterial hypertension and circulation problems in the feet, have listed the physician.
Fujimori has been serving imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Department of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political links
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, consisting of various ministers and employers, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and discuss the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community resident in Mexico, according to the agenda issued by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French agent Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries since November, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to implement the tax exchange agreements to exit the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is composed of countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
In trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (LCT) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The lead mustachu moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, untiring, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the bad Bowser claws, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores around the world, was designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopic without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support", because so far successes like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang users less skilled.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the levels of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, which has not been happening since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo glances at the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists of the fact that the leader must travel through platforms mined of perils to release Princess Peach.
Even though I find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom endorses the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States' conspiracy for the whitening of US$70 million.
This concludes the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called for Portillo to judge it.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term of office "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given rise to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Morocco will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Walles will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did implies an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former representative of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for the diversion of Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Department appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 youth at risk
The entity was born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
In addition to this, the long-term number of jobs currently obtained by this social group is 100.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping untrained, out-of-work people with problems of addiction or marginalization.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, demonstrated the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Arthur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the act was attended by former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor to the Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Municipal Counsellor Richard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended in the large Fabra i Coats hall.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight the bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by scrapers for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 apartments of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of Rue Balmes' number 51 lived ended.
Twelve people left yesterday at noon voluntarily the building they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-fests that were desperate for neighbors, in judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeated.
"From this day there will be a control of access," said the administrator.
Squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of that of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially alcohol boxes.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which would last up to two days and desperate tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained for Europe Press that since the occupation of the building its business has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque recalled that the invaders of the property made him unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation facility had to respond to neighbouring complaints about noise, while, according to the latter, the disturbances were not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants at the parties there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The disco manager explained that the troubles were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building, and it was nine months ago that he "forgive him" rents him.
The Urban Guard (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from the neighbours for this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the mayorate's PP, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the common and civic problems caused by it to residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "it must end with impunity and be ruthless against antisocial behaviour generated in the property."
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral's number 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide with the opportunity of convening beyond the polemic on fees
The municipal competition on 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in the middle of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters from Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large metropolitan Barcelona park.
In addition, it also included a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park has again become, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not run on the north-south axis, or high (mountain) - low (mer).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is for the benefit of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with leechers in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayorate convened a mega competition consisting of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door gives the idea of park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all architects in Barcelona.
This is almost a recurring theme, two of which are members of this former elite caste speak when they are recognized in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, academic professors, have come together.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of green house pastes has not been completed.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the wider park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "Colserola ports" contains a "lexic trap": it is not to think of them "such as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it must act".
Modal, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as "intelligent challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and had in the area of the Forum "his singing of swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," i.e. its overrun.
"It is necessary to think of new urban planning instruments, because the current [referred to the Metropolitan General Plan (MPG)] can cause real disasters."
In keeping with the question, Modol feels that, by simplifying, the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronate that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the mayor offers to his corporation to intervene in this project "from the very first moment".
In addition, he understood that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the exception that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success", he said) that we had to create: "We architects, we should be only an instrument".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this play is complex, because the basis of the competition there is a lack of an overall vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-sectional contests - it says - in the sense of the sea mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading that goes and understands the area as a whole".
This, at least in this case, makes him choose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project to enable one of the doors to collide in the program and define with that of the architect of the neighbouring door.
In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should, in its entire extension, provide for an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives to Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the Casino Red's legal power base granted forgiveness to the mayor's brother in Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic fee so that the mayor of Monterrey would allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the brother of Mayor Panist and on 2 September the Prosecutor was arrested and held on interim arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Department Officer 3 of Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to Detention Centre 1, located in the Old State Capital Quarter.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was given a second order of detention after the Public Prosecutor's Officer had dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadreyta penal center allegedly for having made the owners of Casino Red sing with one and a half million pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the middle security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial contained in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as that of the 1.5 million pesos of the game house representatives in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the foundation of the legal power of the Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During legal formalities, the Public Prosecutor's Officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who associated with the playhouse had been the one who granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under Case 197/2011, legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claim may be made regarding the trial brought against him; no compensation will be sought for any damages and no punishment.
After the hearing of the foundation of the legal power of the playhouse, at 15:50 hours, the immediate freedom of Larazabal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the San Nicolás de los Garza municipality prison to inform Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate freedom issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which he lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and seven others
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter directly hit the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions were adequate for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contact with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that the investigations carried out in the impact area do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In one research, it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the Secretary has ensured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation may last for a few months, it may even last one year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State was operating at a speed of cruising and this happened on an ascending soft ground.
"This information supports the assumption of normal operation cruising at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, TBS holder Pérez Jácome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft moved towards the border area between DF and the state of Mexico, there were low-level layers of nebulosity.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the conditions of nebulosity the crew sought a lower and more visible area of height to the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably prior to the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral path.
The aircraft debris dispersal model suggests that the helicopter struck the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
In the place of the disaster there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple ground contacts.
During the field work there were aircraft parts at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, the ground had a slope that ranged from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarranged along his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After careful search in a wider area than the surrounding area, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact has occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by INP specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, known as the "Genetics of the Obesity of Children and Adolescents" protocol that will allow the markers associated with overweight.
In a press release, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialities Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and third-cycle students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvesav) from the National Polytechnic Institute (INP).
The investigation calls for participation of the population with or without the right to participate in the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where evidence to minors is made every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the sports unit Cuauhtémoc (State of Mexico West) and that as of 8 October, the activity took place in the sports unit of Nezahualcoyolt (State of Mexico East).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of Federal District) and finally in Morelos Sports Unit (north of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and the objective of this research is to identify the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
As will be celebrated on 14 November on World Diabetes Day, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, to apply specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and history of family inheritance of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that Saturdays will be applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, size circumference), blood pressure, glucose levels determination, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (one seeks to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years, there has been an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 per cent obesity and in the case of girls of 47 per cent; in the case of overweight, there has also been a dramatic increase', said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the others by its genetic history.
He informed that on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of indo-American inheritance, 30 per cent European and five per cent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full evaluation of children, which enables them to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearms indicate the probability of having metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, to whom each is explained of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they have to achieve in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - meat pasta to cornmeal wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would prevent cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs that the paved were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair approximately 200 thousand cases each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, alert Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous pavement is adequate, the cassis could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some northern cities, to improve the performance, and therefore, the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphalts, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pâté its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes breaking, adds.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental and temperature conditions, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México mostly were covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three involving asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that forms the layer, he pointed out, is bathed year asphalt.
When vehicles go through it with efforts, it allows the forces to propagate very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, the chemical engineer thought.
On the asphalt layer, he said, one last layer called the rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion on the street.
As the part of the Pavé receives and distributes the efforts, the rolling layer also requires that the Pavé has adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, as they significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil becomes wet, the water spreads inside the layer, it is difficult to do so, which collapses all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes the cassis.
In the process of forming a cassia, he said, the first one that breaks down is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that needs to be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of cassia and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent formation of cassia.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow for easy and without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing for Valle's candidate to be the new Colombian miss?
Analysis of factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not get the crown of Colombian miss.
Valle receives her title number 14 as a princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of winners, wearing the crown of money and the band that accredited her as Colombia's new princess.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico was mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina joined a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcès Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcès Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people are asking is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to do with being the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Vision Joye de Vogue, titles obtained by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not believe with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez of Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the response of the Valle candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
This answer did not first because of the term "culturalize" and secondly not to explain in concrete terms how each book quoted had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, read please a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the assumptions made is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the ovating and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (the challenge of Oster gastronomy, the public's vote for the best craftsman costume, and Queen Mother), "it woke up the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage."
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the crown.
Although she had been sure of herself on both sides, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program (Comme at home), of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury of its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition they are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by its defects in its back and the fibrosis that was observed in its abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected it as the candidate 'Natural goodness' with the body healthier, good food and responsible physical work.
The Queen's Preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which, in fact, had not been too well known to me, left points on the last day."
Meanwhile journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, considers that the error of Valle's candidate was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this prize, which the National Beauty Competition gave for the first time, after the swimsuit parade arose a cruel prediction that took place last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopicist from Cali went on to history like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th, a keyographer of the Cali ITC went through history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopicists working at the local ITC offices, this week was the "availability" tour of Elias González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and, after following proper courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano we warned Elias to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, picker and lantern, Elias compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the map.
His eye was not mistaken: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible who confirmed to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme chief of the Farcs.
Looking for the print
For a Dactyloscopicist of Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Elias González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from identifying the bodies, the dactyloscopicists support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have any documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher said that in a flight case he had to remove part of a wall from a house, because in this place the thief had held his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of all hands and identify the offender who had participated in different flights," he recalls.
The fingerprints may also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man with bottles of drink around him.
By means of the investigation it was determined that a parent could be suspected of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it's the crime scene.
One ITC dactyloscopicist explained that "digital fingerprints are extracted from objects with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a pick-up or a band is used to remove them.
Subsequently, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the trigger database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that everything is not how we show up in the CSI television program.
As all that shines is not gold, anything that touches does not necessarily become a fingerprint.
It can, however, be used if the necessary confrontation is made.
The "indignants" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were bouncing in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people have entered the evacuation order and have moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were bogging in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a court order that allows the 'indignant' to camp again in that place, while the other part of the movement responded to evacuation by occupying a more northern park, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in place, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupe Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the 'indignants' to the evacuation of their camps personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested a few protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the actual figure, ensuring that Ef because he saw some journalists who had also passed handcuffs.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support of members of the movement and has tried to intervene in their behalf before the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property facility - remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
A few internally displaced protesters were carrying and distributing copies of this order at that time and even delivering it to the agents who were monitoring the place, which caused 'some small clashes', Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials had hit the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting the members of Occupy Wall Street or applying 'laws published after the start of the occupation or from prohibiting protesters from returning to the park with tents or other properties they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this order of justice, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, but he warned that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal council defended personally the evacuation carried out at dawn in place of Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 persons were arrested and decided on account of the fact that the protesters 'violent the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases, to harm others", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn was repulsive and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The leaders of "Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which started on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas television program
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", a wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Canadian TV Christmas.
Today, the private television channel CTV announced that Anderson, alongside the "coroner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet broadcast of a private porn video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed like the Virgin Mary by supporting a doll in a daycare that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's special program also presents Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March and is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called America's Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan was born after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral in early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still conquering after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country of Japan since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses at $300 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seemed to have diminished.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September used to turn the page permanently: GDP increased 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rates.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of the capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of unabated increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructures, use deficiencies for zero growth.
Japan has mainly woken up by changing domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable has grown by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigmatize of the yen
Tokyo has returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugees" elected by investors who flee the eurozone debt crisis and the troubled United States forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, accounted for their low results between July and September for the contribution of yen.
While markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not diminish custody.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of yen, need to be followed," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that in September the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the bending points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being curbed.
For it dropped four decimals to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 points out.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, not lower than eight decimal points up to 99.13 points.
Athens again nurtures doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to blend into the labyrinth leading to the outcome of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is, rather, imposed by the requirements of Brussels, is that real political forces are beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos yesterday pointed out that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days established in his designation may be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the planned date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," said Papadimos when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform of the staff disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not express doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and clearly said that he would not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the major Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have much to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses Spain's "preponderant" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-leading place in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the past two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "gas" lies in the fact that it is an "tool for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the Vth World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "especially, in the one that aims to reduce the volume of people living with incomes under one dollar a day, to which the "poverty threshold" is set."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "met a lot of goals" and "we face a lot of challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are coming out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering manner" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project gave her yesterday the "head of family" meeting in Valladolid from the "bank of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in seeking solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez has considered that micro-credit assumes "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "confidence" to people "exclusive to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Congress, Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, a chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe's future was not initially planned for the programme but was imposed in the fall, especially to satisfy the militants who judge the government's policy too laxist towards Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, following their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave any doubt.
The idea-master of the chancellor - and the motion - lies in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
This is in any case one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress of which the inspirer is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Sept will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the heel is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's directorate on the basis of the weight of each economy, which was of course only strengthening the weight of Germany.
The chancellor increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she also did not seek to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty who were quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the deep.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the disease arrest fraud represent?
After the allocations, the PMU and the government are launching an offensive on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15, in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and to give a speech on the theme - which has been repeated since 2007 - of combating social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts with a willingness to make savings in a harsh context, but is no less an announcement of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority want to focus on disease arrests.
First of all, for budgetary savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day's work deficit on private employees prior to the end of work.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' salary, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that may provoke anger, but which would make it possible to report EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another, more symbolic measure: to impose on civil servants a day of uncompensated deficiency in the event of a cessation of work (they have not so far a period of shortage, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also raise the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuses related to work arrests.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will repay," Xavier Bertrand warned at RTL micro on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of the frauds to work arrests.
This has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditures in 2008 with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% were maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% were sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
Thus, 2.5% of health expenditures.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the Career Management Site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had taken no sick days.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance , indicates that in 2010, 37% of disease arrests were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer inclined to stop work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France ranged from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud of disease arrests is very low in the face of black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, it is limited to a small extent.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 means that controls are systematic on disease judgements of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285 000 short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
For arrests of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% "unwarranted or unjustified" cases of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, therefore, 169 000 cases "unjustified", out of several million employees who have had a disease stop.
A figure that represents very little, for example, compared to that of black work.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, it would represent €9-15 billion of tax loss per year, or more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud.
Papadémos: Greece will need to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to improve its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos, in front of Parliament, said on Monday 14 November, adding that the hundred days given to his union government would not suffice to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue efforts to restore the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government, who gave his first public address at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos planned that the country's public deficit would be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader on the right, gave his support on Monday to the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage in an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with Members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of 8 billion euros necessary without written guarantee from all parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says an expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to speak with their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of a strong report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts related to various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where necessary, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
If Canada has ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people fear to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report to us the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire that most Canadians die at home, 68.6% end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that there is no change in the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted by non-competent or non-consensive persons.
On the contrary, he said yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, there would be more cases of these overflows specifically in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
We recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the life of the elderly or disabled is less valuable.
As for persons who have committed assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents felt that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect life-long care refusal without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that it be considered, when it does not serve to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some health law experts have already made reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has qualified as "extreme" the position of the signatory experts of the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society, he says, there are tags and constraints."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifesta".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular challenges the data of the report regarding the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, namely in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Ladies denounces a plot
Syria is increasingly isolated
partisans of Bachar al-Assad showed yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry's premises.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria in Bachar al-Assad, which, with Russia's support, resisted and denounced a "couple" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand for the departure of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bachar al-Assad to "take power away" in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bachar had the interest of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot be satisfied with them," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey adopts an increasingly tough line.
The United States welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey are adopting a growing tone" in the face of repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
In the meantime, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime died in the Deraa region, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians died "from shooting and piloting to heavy machine guns in Jobar" in Homs City, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualem nevertheless felt that the country "was heading towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus's work, which he believed constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not flutter," he added, ensuring that "ordinary plots against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now considering a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers in the country.
French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also welcomed the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believed is part of the paranoia.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the event of the challenge and release of the demonstrators arrested.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergueï Lavrov yesterday found the Arab League's decision "wrongly", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while maintaining support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a little time in the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the unions and the patronage.
It should set up a relatively small office consisting of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the interviews, after meeting with the President of the designated Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a small list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervous nature of the stock market and its obligations yesterday, demanding time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" for preparing a government and its programme, he stressed, saying "some markets will be patient and understand".
Its designation by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, even though he stressed that he would like to include "policies".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti undertook, once he took office, to work in the emergency and to the aim of Italy's "remaining protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson from European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary balance in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, called for further stringent measures.
The Italian "patron of patrons" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "for a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of serious" and another "Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place by April 2012 EUR 200 billion in state bonds.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon, said an American NGO specialized in atomic risk on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week its "serious concerns" regarding a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Oural), and would have been involved in manufacturing synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA refers to "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well but who, as one Member State has informed the Agency, has worked during most of his career on this technology within the nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Crimes and anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased from almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or little, according to FBI statistics made public Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49% increase, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews, and an overall increase of 14% of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by race differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," said the organization of human rights rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he added, thinking that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is an inheritance from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual membership.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform, in particular to enable its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allows you to follow more legibly, live the activity of the other "Twittos", the netizens who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they are following messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast throughout the Monday network, the AFP told Twitter's spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its instinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to broadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of major Facebook and Google+ public networks.
On the network, users would discuss tweets on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity functionality will help me to better track some elements of my Twitter stream," sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of a budgetary "gold rule" in the constitution
The Government of the Great Social-Democrat/Democrat-Christian Coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary "gold rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid possible degradation by the rating agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision following a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was reduced only from one skull, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros in extra interest every year," argued Vice Chancellor and Christian Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria therefore responds to a request from the euro area member countries in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017 onwards, the structural public deficit of the federal state will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and the municipalities will have to submit budgets in balance.
The aim is to place public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty up to 2020/21.
Yen strong
Noda threatens a new intervention on the exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the exchange market if the yen were to continue to mount.
"We will intervene as we last did if we find excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, explained Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, yen was not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yen against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of vigor since 1945 against the green ticket.
But the yen has been constantly up since, driven by purchases of investors who consider it as a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is rolled under the 77 yen Tuesday and the euro has come down under the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar listed around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This Japanese currency outbreak is detrimental to exports from the archipelago because it costs Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues from abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan's struggle to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), said Mr.Noda who feared that this enrichment of yen would kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power has renewed with growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in one year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households driven by disasters.
But the Prime Minister found that the yen's cost did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of his monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no additional monetary flexibility was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the Emissions Institute increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euro) its purchases of Treasury bills to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euro) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The rates are rising, the scholarships are flanging
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the designation of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and higher growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Always worried about the stability of the euro area, the European Fellowships are sinking a little further into negative territory on Tuesday, 15 November.
At 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% at 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt gives 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new strains on the returns of borrowings from euro area states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nerves, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters Agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7 per cent, in turn suffering from renewed market concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its own eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a corridor of narrow variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved at its lowest level for one and a half months.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, corresponding to 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she withdrew after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in congress on Monday, adopted a motion, including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian bonds at 10 years reached 6.85%, that of the Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The leader of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time to markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the " main task " of his government.
Spain is on the market, while there are legislative elections in the country on Sunday.
The rate gap (" spread ") between Germany's 10-year obligations and Spain has reached a new higher history.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%, achieved by household consumption.
Insee, however, revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a decrease of 0.1% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth thing that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over dogmas
If it is a matter which cannot be dealt with on short-term or emotional grounds, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the role of nuclear power.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless it deprives a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to bridge the gap in fossil resources to continue to produce electricity at all times, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate deregulation, a missing subject of environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
It is neither the case of Belgium, which submits to the need to find a source of replacement capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which just intends to build only the last generation power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote only them, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, they decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by restarting the construction of an interrupted plant after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, which focuses on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is contrary to speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in the price of electricity, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of gas imported, in particular from Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these ugly effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
He is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind intermission; therefore, his CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a higher electricity bill of 40% than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make the excellent declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French refuse to pay, especially if they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, polls show it.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has helped build an industrial chain of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of specialised SMEs in international markets and makes them very creators of non-removable jobs.
If France had just decided to leave nuclear power, it would be to sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing as a skin of sorrow the 6 billion euros a year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to function for sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be acknowledged that there is no source of miracle electricity, nor is there any evil.
The development by Areva of low-emitting CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear safety, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a Safety Authority that exercises an intransigent and transparent control over existing power plants as well as on the Flamanville construction site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same security obsession.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear industry suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failings caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamenville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to take leadership in the undisturbed development of nuclear.
It is essential and legitimate to search for the best energy stock for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised in various angles - including police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "the countries of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23rd) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
It is that there is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right on this subject.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who in 1976 stated that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't welcome all the world's poverty" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by Polish lead hordes was shared on the left as well as on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be accorded to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande can join in banalitys, indicating that co-development will solve our "migrant problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electoral pay, but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Reducing immigration is anaemic to growth and unemployment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace national workers, particularly those who are not qualified, with lower pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, which are mainly employed in job shortages.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and those most qualified in dynamic areas where training does not follow the job supply.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has thus calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows results in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of immigrants naturalized among American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant aged 30 will make a net contribution (recipients minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 on average to public budgets throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, using to deter immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think of European democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for his invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be sufficient, in order for democracy to finally succeed its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner whatsoever.
We know, from Napoleon the Little, that it was a ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can even become an "oppression instrument" as the former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is a crisis of politics and democracy.
In this regard, the palinody of the true Greek referendum will have had double-developing value: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongructity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have today moved, and that for many of them Republican soldiers no longer draw in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized on the basis of needs and in dispersed order.
A white seing at the European absolute monarch or a jump to feet attached in the vacuum of the nationalist replica: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but we want a common exercise of full right, sound and continuous choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we can no longer know where to stop listing - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole who leans on the dictates of markets and rating agencies, who suffer from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the pilotage of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because it is together that Europeans can reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will imply decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, unless, of course, we are led to disaster.
After a long time of fighting this proposal from Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
It's not that bad.
But thinking of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in European construction.
In order to make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution in Interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
Flea cards "without contact" become general
The world square show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% of world sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card phone...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm.
The most carrying segment is that of the non-contact technology that allows to pay for public transport or to settle its purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million cards without contact should be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to further progress in 2012 (580 million expected units) and to represent nearly 10% of the global market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
In the long run of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe gains ground for non-contact payment.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double caps.
Carrefour issued this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed themselves to systematically disseminating to their customers banking cards without contact in the future," said Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the payment of the future: mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for making transactions.
"They've been late."
"But they should finally have a real growth next year."
"Our tables on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 around the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhone of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société General, she too, said yesterday to prepare the market for an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front expands
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which the two organizations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French people in Niger last January would have updated the gateways.
Kidnappés in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their fans during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the sections of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls leads to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It is an advance, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of more and more complex kamikazes or explosive devices as well as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of low-interested illuminates.
Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - meaning "Western education is a sin" - calls for the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the trolley while its activists are engaged in the fight against the impious central government.
The latter are first aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is investing the city, we have 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
From that time the sect will radicalize and leave its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, she called for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another one in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took up the secure police QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, which the Somalis of al-Shebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information" .
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying the thunderous declarations and shortenings in foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unsupported - merge.
Mitt Romney, the best in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to drag the Chinese into the WTO and challenge them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme in America that is overwhelmed by the migration of whole pens from its industry to Asia.
So much worse if it should involve the outbreak of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China of Obama and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has nearly been shocked by an attitude that "flats" the emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who lies in the depths of polling, remains unheard of.
Like Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he fanfaroned."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfil his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, second best-placed candidate, has a embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he was calling against the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to engage the US Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy burden in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say that Reagan also had simple ideas and he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to put water in his wine with regard to anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naïve dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of Iraq's "boys", on its twists in Libya, thus attaching a weak label to it.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population believes that Obama's national security balance sheet, which eliminated Ben Laden, is rather positive.
Since Iraq, she has been suspicious of military interventions that lead to settlement.
And arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The North Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia, moving to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a burst.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated last Tuesday on the Baltic shores, between orchestras and fine buffets, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects Russia directly, under the sea, to Germany.
Symbolicly, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first 1,224 km tube linking the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed at the end of 2012, enabling a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we already mention the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction site has the air of victory.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossing through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe of energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has barely succeeded in having its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas users, and whose deposits are declining.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," François Filon confirmed by opening this pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles displayed by Gazprom's leaders, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical operation.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-gained steel to protect it against ships' anchorages.
It is located on the seabed, 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid fields of mines dating from the Second World War.
"A hundred must have been removed or destroyed, by precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesperson for North Stream.
There was also a need to multiply the measures to protect wildlife and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts on its entire length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned across Sweden, but project managers gave up while the Swedish were reluctant to see a Russian state society established on a permanent basis off their coast.
"In case of damage, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline shall therefore escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who planned the welds to escape every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the state of the pipeline shall be carried out by an underwater robot, drawn by a vessel, for external observation, as well as by an aircraft operating inside the pipeline.
Of the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, width of one meter diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, it provides accurate information on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline was designed to run fifty years without having to suffer the least repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
It's 200 bars from the start, and 100 bars from the start.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who keeps 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF were joined (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
She has her seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty renewable years, all of the gas transport capabilities.
" Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for gas pipeline construction was provided at 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has risen to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their costs, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Valves, 4,5 meters tall, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, brand name card.
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white colour, as old as by time.
Yet, the Moleskine booklet as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a design notebook but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is based on an old production technique, the mole skin (skin skin) which means a varnished cotton used to cover banquets for example.
This type of booklet was very popular with writers and travelers.
" Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, up to the twentieth century ", says Maria Sebregondi, who has become the brand leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robot portrait of the buyer, as the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, accounts for almost 100 today and has since 2008 two offices; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from Fnac to small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails," says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies Moleskine's development: the brand recently launched an exhibition "Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own books.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and its cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer covers... The brand features a wide range of media.
A success that made ambitions: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is even twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the whole population.
Discouragement?
"No, says Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of persons with disabilities."
" The progress made over the past 15 years has been considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, there is still a great deal to be done."
It must be said that for the disabled, there are still many barriers to access to employment.
They are fairly old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the scholarship and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for people with disabilities, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that specifically complicate return to employment, and which "are the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
This is for objective brakes.
It remains the non-said, the mentality that evolves, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City indicated that the interviewed managers have "a low level of knowledge of disability ", with a "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual disabilities " .
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, as set out in a law of... 1987.
The last known figures, which date back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies," explained Pierre Blanc.
" But this improvement also reflects real awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of businesses from 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "How happy I am."
Before facing the Blues Tuesday evening (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match provides them.
We won't even write that there was conniving between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side-by-side on the platform of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after his attacker's mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian picker only has praise to do about him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his progress and his being Belgian."
"I want to go ahead," says Lillois.
As for the contrast between his club and selection benefits, "it is a whole, if justified."
"In Lille, I've been there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Menageed against Romania Friday evening in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
However, without omitting the notion of "pleasing".
The Blues have encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
This must be done to further strengthen the "particular" character of this meeting.
So on the front, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," remember.
"We've crossed the line so far."
"Being able to play against them is only happiness!"
With kindness, Leekens referred to the "fierce" for his part.
"Fighted" to fight "a gala game."
"Feritty" also indicates - as "neighbor" - that France has become "a very high-level team" a little over a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a work of thunder," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would well share the plane with the Blues... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will report this to yourself at the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimism his dam back to Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been handling since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to play.
In view of the match go (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it was obvious that the games were not made.
Portugal has dominated the part for more than an hour, of course, but it has been unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but there's a certain risk because we haven't set goals outside."
But in their bright Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there too boiling, even though the party obviously announces itself "very tight," said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We're waiting for a very tight match, but we're absolutely convinced we can take the top," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012", however relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The no-one reported on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
No one can suffice for the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but there is a certain risk because we haven't set goals outside," says Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that has many technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put a maximum pressure on Bosnians so as not to "give them time to reflect."
A good idea, provided you're realistic this time.
