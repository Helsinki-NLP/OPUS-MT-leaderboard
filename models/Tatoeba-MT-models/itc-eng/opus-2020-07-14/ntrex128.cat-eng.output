Members of the Galles Assembly concerned to "identify them as Muppets"
Several members of the House have expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has taken root in the plan to change the name of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a cause for ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "remained with Twp or Pwp."
For readers who are not Welsh: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru Party assembly commented that the whole party of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
On the other hand, a Welsh Conservative member claimed that his group was "open" in front of the name change, but he also commented that there is a too small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the letter "u" in English from Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly in charge of drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualification to call the members of the assembly will of course fall within the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Wales Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, even though the committee was decanted by "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the choice of "MWP" is the one that received greater support in the public consultation.
Apparently, members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives; however, the attempt to achieve a consensus may pose a whole mess for the president of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as standards on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will hold the final vote on their name during the debate on legislation.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on the change of name in their country
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the Northern Macedonia Republic.
The popular consultation was decided on an attempt to resolve a dispute that has lasted for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to be part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, contrary to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price to be paid for becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the old people I've spoken to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's none left, both of them."
According to Adam, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he says.
"The bars have already stopped being that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people went there periodically."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money they get from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders predict, "and sooner or later they will return to the place where they came from."
The churches, it adds, could end up being replaced by apartments and condominiums with the kind of people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white-bred," he says, "so what they will do will accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white - language congregation there departed in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to 125th street retailers, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they took over the cart.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's Church, described his pride as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who ringed the wagon in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the world's first career that was played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who had to move to the largest rail in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What did sound in St. Martin's in the last few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, formed by lay leaders, wrote in the diocese last July all expressing its concern that the diocese "pretty to transmit costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy looking for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent about half an hour knocking with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help, and then rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says it was first thought it was about the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he "learned that he shouted 'I'm bitten!
I've been bitten!'
He had the whole squirt," Hammel watched as he got to the boy.
"Because everyone comes out of the water, I cried out, 'There's a shark in the water!'," adds Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was taken seriously.
You don't know what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that work a few weeks that had detected a shark in the area, but that was decided that that species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most of them do not consider themselves dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, to the market for beauty products in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, Superdrugs and Devenhams with hallucins of beauty products in the style of large stores occupied with specialized employees.
These large corridors are only part of a considerable investment in the beauty product market in the United Kingdom, a market that moves around GBP 2800 million and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors stay behind, and will be tried at 11 stores across the country to expand the next year if the test becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of space in their shelves that was previously destined for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's claims that it will double its beauty offer to offer up to 3000 different products, included for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space with areas of branding similar to those that can be found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also in the phase of relaunching its range of boutique makeup products so that most products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly called for by younger consumers.
The minority chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions to two Sainsbury's stores, the first one did so last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and switching into a habit of buying food in smaller amounts every day to small supermarkets has made large supermarkets need to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly look like large stores in an attempt at the supermarket chain to fight Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's been introducing Argos' sales points to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he comments, served to release sales of oaks and increase the profitability of procurement.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its departments of beauty and pharmacy products resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's joint operation with Boots at the beginning of the decade of 2000, but it all came to an abrupt conclusion of not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain into the supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of his 281 pharmacy business in Celesio, owner of LloydsPharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury product brands for the skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, says, "We've transformed the look of our beauty product corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specially trained workers who will be of great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and that we challenge the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "crazy" after Holly Willoughby is back from a deal of GBP 11 million
Dragon's star's Den Peter Jones went "crazy" after TV star Holly Willoughby went back to a deal of 11 million GBP with Jones's life-style branding business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to engage in the joint home product business and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptorow.
37 - year - old presenter This Morning used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' Star Den Peter Jones mad at withdrawing in the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle business to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the red star on television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his central empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, which the new agreements of the presentation, worth GBP 1.5 million, meant that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of household products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Plaintow and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When 37 - year - old Willoughby used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane heading to one of his holiday homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
He was destined to be his long-term future, where we would see him for the next 20 or thirty years.
His decision to step back left without words all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's station ready to be sold."
According to experts, the march of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company because of the significant investment made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and clothes for the home, and the possibility of delays for its release.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin had had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined him as president last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of their share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next brand ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity program host to the ITV.
A source near Jones commented last night that "we will not comment on their business."
Bad charges... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticisms from the media to make a comment that some would consider "little of a president" and to have such a positive opinion from the North Korean leader.
Why'd you give up Trump so much?
Trump said, mocking a newsman's voice tone:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are stagnated.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "correspondence response" by the US to the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
However, he observed, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump’s view, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
And now we have this great relationship."
According to Trump, their efforts to improve relationships with Kim have had positive results: an end to missile trials, help free hostages and return home to remnants of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this corner full of people, we'd have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
A destroyed island and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was told to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," says Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not sure that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute to offering help.
Given the constant sixth suffering from Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although Aceh has built shelters in the case of tsunamis, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in case of tsunami, although there was a warning in force, it is very likely that he contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of Indonesian islands is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to reach the victims of the earthquake is now heading toward Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of the poor infrastructure of Indonesia, and he has invested enormous amounts of money in rail and rail roads.
However, Joko's government faces the coming year of the re-election with funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displacements are the result of the fighting that takes place on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with mats, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes the goal of the room with a remote jot in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with his goal scored at the minute 89th Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's port office when his team was losing 1 to 0.
He accommodated the ball to the left before leaving an incredible jot directed to the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great elevation as it propelled into the right cross of the door.
The pilot finally began the descent over a full jump Kepa Arrizabalaga to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible," says Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanté come, I made a knock, and I didn't think much, I just committed to kick."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at the break after scoreing a goal at the 25th minute through her Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the front of the Blue team came back from the heel a pass in Mateo Kovacic before it started from almost half the field and sped out into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
Then he made a magnificent, deep passage, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball controlled.
Hazard passed the defense to end up in the second pole with a fist with his left leg where he could not reach the porter of Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples at the group phase of the Champions League next Wednesday at 15:00 in St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for its part, will play with Videoton in UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths due to the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings collapsed because of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 metres, according to the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered in the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a stabbed woman
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with several stabs on Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect of murder.
The police have asked the people in the area who have seen or heard something about the crime before the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statements: "If the investigation is still at a preliminary stage, I would like to make a call to everyone near John Street in Birkenhead and that I have seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially to taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the car's on-board camera, who get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman they found was Birkenhead's body and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are reporting the facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
When she knew what had happened, she ran out of words.
He's warning residents that there'll be hours until they get back in.
You could feel like a police officer told a man that the whole area is treated as the crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
Don't stop saying "It's terrible!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the area lined up with another truck parked outside.
A number of Roman agents inside the agreed area controlling the block of floors.
Anyone who can have information to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously by 0800 555 111 and mention 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewrite history"
Its disappearance would be a sort of poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban's purest style of many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "boxy" and a "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the retreat of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster's palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for his ancestor's actions during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy to be commemorated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than not now, as a defender of parliament in front of external pressure, in his obvious case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a completely accurate representation is a topic of historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th century Middle Ages conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His absoluments as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated."
A killer pig fatally kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered with blood near a court of pigs at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported on Sunday at South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject cattle into pigs in a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as you know, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him a court of contiguous pigs.
According to the court, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kild garry had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs crushed and full of blood," said the cousin, named "Wu," as noted in the news of the evening of Guiyang.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig was locked and isolated in order to avoid anyone else attacking, while the police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market managers are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although very rare, cases of pigs that attack humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts, and left the man with severe wounds.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kg took a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "decadent."
"They like to play.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt.
Just give them the respect they deserve," he remarked.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains all over the south-west of the United States
According to predictions, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains all over northern Mexico and the South West of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, owned by a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, time in the east of the United States, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is beginning to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving toward the west coast of the United States. When the Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity north towards the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will leave as many as 250 mm of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Next, tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains all over the southwest during the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous streams, waste streams, and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The tropical rainstorm will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
They expect from 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There's a chance that there's a lot of laughter, because the situation is getting worse very quickly because of the scattered character of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the tropical rain threat.
Stormy rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable rivers, and storms could carry wind and dusty clouds to specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at determined points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that there are total precipitations above 50 mm, which could cause flows of smaller waste and slippery roads.
It would be the first rainstorm of the rainy season in the region.
They will begin to arrive in isolated tropical rainheads in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread into the four cornered region on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
October there will be several major temperature oscillations across the United States as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature within a short distance.
The Central American region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
There were nearly 20 degree temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines Iowa.
For the next few days, the lingering heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will start with heat in most of the Central and Eastern US, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the South Plans to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities to record temperatures above average in the U.S. during the first half of October.
Over 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw the passionate witness of the candidate of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, who allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the regular Friday programming due to a round of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford explained to the Senate committee for judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, asserted that he was absolutely convinced that this was never the case.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million spectators have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other strings that transmitted the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Besides, Nielsen often has problems in calculating the people he sees from his office.
Based in perspective, it's an audience similar to that of an American football playoff party or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders who clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the chain with more audiences, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the one-day testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS reached 3.1 million, the NBC 2.94 million, the MSNBC 2.89 million and the CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while being rebuked by protesters when he was trying to get up to an elevator to go to a hearing of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake spent several minutes with the fainting sight while being on live TV with CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
"You think he's telling the truth in the country?
They said, 'You have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!"
Flake said her office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, she commented that she would have more to say to the committee.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcasting chains were already broadcasting live when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote whether or not it was going on with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary to vote on it.
Flake said, on the other hand, that she would only do that to understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations she had with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made her decision.
Flake's choice had an influence, since it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics in connection with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union of "to play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and of disdaining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the conservative party convention in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, May Boris Johnson's former Foreign Affairs Minister reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, which states that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU are re-captured jointly by taxes is "all absurd".
The Wayde Sims Shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the player on the ULS team
The police arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was militating on the ULS team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and sent to prison accused of murder in second degree, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police picked up the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS WAFB's subsidiary.
After Simpson was interrogated, she admitted that she had killed Wayde with a shot, according to the police.
His bail has been fixed at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The law firm in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday, claiming that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head towards the neck.
The department thanks the State of Louisiana police operating group, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police, and the local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that has culminated in this arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the local order forces for their "diliency and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
About nine feet [1.98 m], he played and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebots to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "distorted" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow."
"Things like this are the ones that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
An ashtray volcano in Mexico City
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and recorded 183 gas emissions and ash in a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring several shocks and tremors that had recently occurred.
Images on social media where a fine layer of ashes is appreciated in the windshields of cars in Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicals have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favour of independence faced the riot police and thousands of people joined in opposing demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of independent individuals held by the riot police began throwing their eggs and painting into dust, causing the appearance of dark dust clouds in the streets usually invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, beatings with the police were produced, which used their pores to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters calling "Long live in Spain."
Fourteen people were subjected to mild injuries during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions did not decrease in this region of independentist mentality a year after October 1 a referendum was held considered illegal for Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence for a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, since the opponents of the secession boycotted the majority.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in the electoral schools throughout the region, causing violent clashes.
The independent groups camped all over Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place equally, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narciss Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independent demonstration together with his wife, said that he no longer had much hope about the possibilities Catalunya would see independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital victory, although by little, in the autonomous elections last December, Catalan independent parties have suffered to maintain the empire this year, since many of their leading leaders are in self-imposed or detained exile, waiting to be tried for their role in the referendum organization and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration of support for the police on his phone, and said that the conflict had been fueled by both sides' politicians.
"The tension is only increasing," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce backwardness in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after wearing a house with a car
Three men 33, 34 and 39 years old have been arrested after a car repeatedly invests against a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says they caused damage to the doors and the same building.
Also, at some point, someone may have shot a bullet against the car.
A Menga game gives Livingston victory for 1 to 0 in front of Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingston was to win
Livingston, who this year had gone up as a category, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which it's just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's play marked the difference, since, with this victory, Gary Holt's team goes up to second position, which is shared with Hibernian.
Gerard's, on the other hand, still don't win out of the Premiership this season, next Sunday they're going to face the leader, the Hearts, who separates them a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive Vienna's Rapid in Europe League this Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston has expanded to six parties his invicted hijacking in the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston doesn't take advantage of his opportunities in front of the visitor's direct game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scoreboard long before the goal was, since its direct game caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but he wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the doorkeeper, and then Alan Lithgow sent the ball outside to pull out to try to finish Craig Halkett's head pass, who crossed the door.
The locals were good enough to let the Rangers get close to their area, as they knew they might put visitors in trouble in isolated games.
And that's how that decisive goal came.
The referee turned a gap against the interests of the Rangers and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so Menga could touch it first and end from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated possession, but he met with an impenetrable defense and a Liam Kelly porter who had very little work throughout the party,
The stage repeated to the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop of credit.
For his part, the Rangers' porter Allan McGregor stopped with his feet on an occasion of Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up diverting another game of Livingston combination.
The Rangers went on to hang once and another ball in the Livingston area, just to be rejected, and two criminal charges were claimed, one for a alleged Halkett entrance to replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for hands, both were dismissed.
Livingston "fenomale": Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks that they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this upward journey.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed from their return to the highest category, although much of the merit must be attributed to Holt by the way the team galvanized from its arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, in the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be hung from Menga throughout the party.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the bright moments exhibited with Gerrard as a coach, they definitely couldn't keep the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly passed the local defense), and that the Rangers, who is at the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Aggressive reception for Erdogan in Cologne
They were all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to such issues as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's EU input.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from congregating in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, were also heard while condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies when he hits a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, south-east of the city, about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, and although paramedics took care of the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a runaway case on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of the accident on Saturday.
Metro police said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest family members.
The street has been cut down and deviations have been applied for bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six agents injured in a altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security prison center, according to the headquarters.
The events occurred in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, about 9.30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still remains.
Specialized "returned" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight inmates were involved.
Officers had to be treated for slight wounds in their face instead of facts.
According to a prison spokesperson: "We have deployed prison personnel specially trained to try to solve an incident that has occurred in Long Martin prison, which still remains.
Six employees have had to be treated with wounds.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, we're clear that those responsible for this fight will have to hold the police accountable, and they might have to spend more time in jail."
In Long Lartin's penitentiary, more than 500 prisoners are found, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
The month of June, it was known that the head of the prison had to be served in a hospital after being attacked by a prison.
In addition, in October of last year, anti-avalot agents acted in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which central staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with important streams (dry areas could be benefited)
It's not unusual for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen in the early part of the week next when what's left of Hurricane Rosa goes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of floods.
The national weather service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesdays to the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Rosa is expected to arrive directly at Phoenix on Tuesday and to arrive at Monday night with rains.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a tweet that only "two tropical cyclists have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression on a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models at the national hurricane center provide 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated spots where they would be recorded as much as 150 mm in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Conca, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated spots up to 100 mm.
For areas not at risk of rivers, the Rosa rain could become very good news, as the region suffers from a severe drought.
Despite the fact that rivers are a serious cause of concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, since the southwest region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US drought control service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reportsweather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will hit land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have strength of hurricane on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
So, it's expected to touch ground in Mexico with tropical storm force the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of floods.
According toweather.com, "they wait from 75 to 150 mm of rain from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 250 mm."
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with a tropical storm force, before reaching the border with Arizona at the first hour of Tuesday morning with a tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah well into the night of Tuesday.
"The main risk we're expecting from Rosa or what's left of him is very heavy precipitation in Baja California, north-west of Sonora and the South-West desert of the United States," according to the national hurricane center.
The rains are expected to cause dangerous streams and streams of waste in the deserts, in addition to landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four detainees for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy had been found with handcuffs in Somerset.
The teenager was found with wounds in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he found himself stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to the police at Avon and Somerset.
Agents have made a call so that anyone who can have some kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone gets in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered the mescanism and wrath" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection vote on the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "strike and anger" of the Democratic Party during his entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh made a statement before Congress Thursday, denying Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual abuse of her when they were both teenagers.
Ford also declared in the eye in relation to his allegorical.
The president said on Saturday that day, "the American people saw the genius, human quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable journey of service to the city," he commented to the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of the rate of participation of Republican voters in the elections in the middle of the term.
"We're five weeks from some of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but actually I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing".
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected to take place as late as Friday, according to CNN, an assistant of the Republican party leaders.
Hundreds of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday because of a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast by sunset, dragging many people to death and tearing everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and they didn't run right away, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spoke of the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, destroyed everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had flown through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed up from a tree fleeing the tsunami and survived, he says.
About 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency that appreciate the amount of shops and destroyed buildings, turned bridges and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to rock this coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the intense earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the city's geographic characteristics, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "remarkable" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 left behind.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dogalea, nearer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and therefore no information came" from Dogalgaa, says Nugroho.
Over 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross commented in a statement, adding that their workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which could unfortunately end much worse," he says.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, even though agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of an amateur social media share, you can feel like a man on the top floor of a building gives desperate shouts of warning to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts on the shore of the sea, taking buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not authenticate the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in the electricity supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Despite the military's beginning to send humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, evacuaters continue to need food desperately, in addition to other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami is about 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Dogalga were able to get safe and secure in the city of Palu, where employees sheltered in canvas shelters installed in the yard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba says.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although the relief groups did the devastating gesture of starting relief work, some people complained that it was preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, provision and provision of foreign personnel can only start to flow if the site where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arrani, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared. "
While he stayed the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing people maintained the hope that the miracle and their loved ones would take away the devastating account of natural disasters.
Saturday, a child was rescued caught in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded early this month in Indonesia.
Besides Mr. Mandage, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
"As a scenario in the paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that, within hours of the fact that he circulated the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel between the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages by WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray checkmark instead of a double blue mark.
“I think that means the messages were not received,” he added.
Thieves take $26,750 during the filling of an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling up an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport police department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy told the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM to the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rape's name is changed to Ye
The Kanye West rapper changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
He's been in West, 41 years old, motegen with his nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before it appears in the program Saturday Night Live, in which it is expected to present its new album, entitled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation by "emotional motives", according to the author of the program.
Besides being a abbreviation for his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West earlier this year, while talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I've passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of what we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers that have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
JAY-Z, former collaborator of West, has taken advantage of his nickname with or without a dash and in capital letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has never promised to use military force against civilians, when there is little time for the country to complete the 50th anniversary of a cruel reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "it would no longer use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root all over Latin America.
López Obrador, who has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
She said that stopping and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funds allocated to AI
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and a professional expert in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures in the field of AI, despite the fact that there is a general lack of formal strategy in the country in AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become world number 1 for innovation in AI in 2030.
"Duplicate the budget for research in AI would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next advancements in the AI field," Lee pointed out.
"Duplicate funding could double the opportunities that the U.S. has for the next major discovery in AI," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director-general of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent IP companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an I.A. system that overcame the U.S. player Othello with the best ranking and later served as executive in Microsoft Research and as president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee positively appreciated previous technology competitions from the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defense Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, "China is not the one taking academic leaders; it's the companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university eminences to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the U.S. task in the I.A. area could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think they should automatically offer permanent residence cards to the doctoral staff in IA," he added.
In July 2017, the China Council of State presented its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Last Generation.
"The Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way as the Foundation of Natural Sciences and other public organizations in the United States give money to researchers in North America, but the quality of academic work is lower than in China," Lee pointed out.
Early in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence created a Joint Art Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industrial and academic collaborators, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Art Intelligence Committee.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of US$2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the Natural Sciences Foundation is concerned, it currently spends more than 100 million USD per year on research at AI.
In the meantime, no measure has been applied for months in relation to the American legislation that he intended to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide if they change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to 'the Northern Republic of Macedonia', a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed since decades with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, submits that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalists argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has doubted whether there will be at least 50% needed participation to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum paper is, "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name-change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have stated that it will affect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularities at 13 o'clock.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, in which 66% of registered persons voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the change of name of the country, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO to Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of tents installed by people who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick with our heads high, not the back door," Kavavarkov explained.
“We are a poor country, but we are worthy.
If we do not want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can make use of other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO's incorporation will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev stated that a "yes" would assume "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another survey, directed by the Macedonian Telma TV station, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% stated that they would vote 'yes'.
Because the referendum is valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would take the first time for the pro-Western government policy since it took over May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, makes a goal after regathering all the defense of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory from 2 to 0 in the match fought at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Auguro scored a goal in the 65th minute in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The silverhead got a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He left at a speed between three Brighton defenses, rooting out his way through the playing field.
Then Agüero was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He skyrocketed a defense before he got a few more off the edge of Brighton area.
Then he made a pass on his left that found Sterling.
The English leader brought the ball back to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, who with his right leg beat Brighton's porter, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that got stuck inside the network on the right side.
"Agüro has trouble on foot," Pep Guardiola, coach of the City, told journalists.
"We decided that he would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky you scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the battle for the Premier League.
His goal came in the morning of 29th.
In that game, Agüero received the ball in depth in Brighton's field and
made a beautiful pass in space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before he passed it to Sterling on the long pole.
The Sky Blues front finished the ball inside the network before going out the bottom line.
The City faced Hoffenheim on Tuesday in part of the Champions League Group phase at 18:55, Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the play-off struggle, there was not much reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to get out on the mountain of the launch on Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage game about Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have the chance to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured a wildfire with victory for 5 to 2 against the Nationals Friday night, but they're still looking to get their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can go out and get to know the environment here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably argue every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this party?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening launcher for Sunday, but apparently they are determined to let Scherzer throw if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a warm-up session on Thursday and launched on Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
The right-wing shuttle in Washington has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike removals in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump makes a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republicans in the elections of half mandate.
"All we have done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, big ones, I don't introduce myself, but I really do introduce myself, so I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You can see that terrible group of Democrats is happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all necessary means, they see their pettyness, their bad intention.
They don't care who they hurt, above who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to "resist and obstruct."
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he replied, and he called the Democrats "enraged, petty, dirty and false."
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, causing a strong public shout.
“ Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Wait a minute... this was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has stopped being a diverse party.
It's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of British parliamentarians who have been told we're not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he showed up firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I was criticized for discriminating with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, and ironically, these are similar issues to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the wake of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party, it was reported that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and it has long been forgotten the policy promise "more generous and kind", if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions do not tolerate the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the Party's direction.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as you colleagues with whom he thought he had previously shared a similar political vision hoped that I would turn 180o and take positions that he would never have taken, either on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I'm saying, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made because my candidacy is not renewed, they denounce central policies and I'm told that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, as the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who have to deal with a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they don't stop.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of "untrustful" or every change in the rules of selection, the party is tightening up.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice and I have been recommended to keep my head down, not so expressive and "all would go well."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by the negligent government of Thatcher, who left my whole class literally sunk, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as local advisor or as minister of the government.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt in any way about my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is walking to a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, actually, the message I want to convey was not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, to benefit the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Some Ayr goads lead the lead
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr earned victory in this vibrant party of Tennant's Premiership day.
The Ayr, which are the only team of ten, occupy the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed by its defensive superiority and the fact that it was better able to take advantage of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The games we've played so far have tested us and we're still in trouble, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose said: "Congratulation for the Ayr, they have taken advantage of the better times than we have."
Grant Anderson's rehearsal at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put in front of the Ayrs, but a yellow card for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, given for the Warriors party, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted essay.
Climo expanded the advantage of the Ayrs with a sanction and, just to the half, annotated and converted a test to put the 17-5 mark in favour of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melroses started the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted to Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Later, the party was interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which withdrew to bed, and the Ayrs resumed the distance with a Stafford McDowall trial converted to Climus.
Next, the alternate Captain Blair Macpherson was introduced with a yellow card and the Melroses again took advantage of a man's superiority with an unconverted test by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of intense pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a plaque on Climo without a pilot, from the sanction line, MacPherson scored a countering behind the Ayr penetrating mole.
Climo marked, as he had done almost again from the dam, after Kyle Rowe collected a fight from David Armstrong and passed the ball on to the third line of Gregor Henry to score the fifth rehearsal of the local team.
The Star of the Still Game Series seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to move to the hotel sector after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis' character in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-protagonizes with Greg Hemphill, his comic partner for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, even though a source of the Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "flowery restoration sector" of Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, without coast, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their ship covered in La Paz.
Public buildings don't have a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonas are enthralled with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It is a duty to recover it.”
Around Bolivia's landless territory, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a conflict of raw resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as it is the longing to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no need to say, wait for the result with a positive stance," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivarian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the TIJ's resolution in large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will support Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession of a sovereign sea exit for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes for Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court would decide in favour of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations organization based in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chile and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The TIJ resolution, which takes place only six months after the final allegations were made, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from seeing yourself favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a setback in the past four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
"The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has attracted any gesture of goodwill from Chile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after this episode.
The two countries had not exchanged embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was exceptionally quick.
Next Monday Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can be trusted in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho claims that his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it seems that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stagnated nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a hot one to think that the continued sanctions and US objection to a statement that put an end to the Korean War could ever make North Korea kneel.
Washington refuses to accept the statement if Pyongyang doesn't make major disarmament movements before.
Both Kim and the president, North American Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang taking seriously the question of giving up an arsenal that the country considers to be the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo has planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last range of big hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which illuminated the style defined in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer the Instagram has been torn down by very unpractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's featured piece was an exaggerated bee hat, adorned with a broad wing, pen-shaped, which flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were decorated sandwiches, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of bright colors, had sewed lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high sewing.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like an ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The big-sized hats climb the heels of the "bomb", a straw hat, with a double-footed wing, which everybody has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label of cult behind the hat so unpractical that spread across social networks led another great creation to the walkway: a bag of straw for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed with bathrobe that wore it.
The pink, dark orange bag, adorned with raffia locks and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the collection The SS19 Riviera in Jacquemusm on the Week of the Paris Fashion.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Considering that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a pity that the demand for large accessories was ignored.
John Edward: Linguistic competences are essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) work to provide a top-level service to students and parents.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a man in a language you understand, you’ll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of the exams of the year, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages received a grade A above.
The data, collected from 74 CIS member schools, reflected that 72% of the students obtained a superior A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital competences that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an assemblage of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) teaching plans from independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the United Kingdom Employment and Competence Commission revealed that the reasons why employers gave them the cost of covering the vacancies were 17% due to lack of linguistic competence.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Since there are more and more opportunities for potential work that require languages, these competitions are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competency like that.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and the French, with 15% speaking, was the only language with a double digit.
So investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children the best opportunity to find an important job.
In Scotland there is a diversity of schools in the languages they teach.
Some schools focus more on the more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest, he'll always be able to choose between a number of languages in independent schools, who have staff specialists in this field.
Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future may look like.
In the global business environment of the present era, it cannot be denied that languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communicative competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
We have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent School Council
LeBron will debut with Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is practically over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-time game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes he'll be playing.
"They'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton to the Lakers' official place.
Mike Trudell, a Laker journalist, tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After this week's early training, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six Lakers pre-temporary games.
"I don't need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready," he replied.
Trump's Mitigation to West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaigning tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first five scheduled rally for the next week, including visits to friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his candidate's confirmation vote to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy is pending, Trump seeks support for the next half- warrant elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 a.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing initiated this week with the candidate nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of the allegations of sexual abuse that he faced, while the Senate's anticipated confirmation vote is pending until one week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this rallying wave is to help Republicans present themselves in the delicate November elections to gain momentum.
So, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for the next week are aimed at "estimating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congrès control is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we are heading for a season of campaign caught,” said a Trump speaker who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could congregate supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavourable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him a boost in the polls," commented Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: North American team shows their ambition to keep the hopes of individual Sunday parties alive
After three uneven sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The rocking pendant of dynamic is an invented sport concept, where players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on what side is the positive dynamic now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're in a little positive essay," Jordan Spieth said as he was leaving at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has one advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is a bit in its favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the state of the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to greek and is setting an example.
The chimes of the celebration rose in intensity as he continued his turn and put a crucial whore to match the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the whore that made them win the game in the 15th hole with a similar shout, of the kind that he says he believes the American team is not yet out of competition.
"You have to work hard and worry about your own party," Spieth pointed out.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable sensation of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple bring four of four and don't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from public bullying, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is placed on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the forballs in the morning, who paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never had a chance to go out.
On Sunday, though, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and ants are very fascinating to see for the interactions between devices, the advice they give and those they don't give, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe arrives at the end of Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finalizing the Saturday fourballs and foursomes with a victory of 10 to 6 over the United States.
The two inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave his record, until now, four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, mastered by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophy that he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that was not correct in the forts of the morning and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the ants and won two games, but they couldn't reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points at the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to get four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple who earns four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After squatting Woods and Patrick Reed in the forballs, they called a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had crawled into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic genius sparks, but lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who didn't take part in the forts in the morning, re-married with Henrik Stenson in the ants and fell by 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe didn't have everything on a nice and windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times tournament champions, and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for the Americans achieving two points on Saturday.
They won a victory with determination for 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the forballs and later won the last 4 to 3 in the forsome after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team had rescinded a difference of four points to individual parties, even though the Furyk team, the title defender, just needs to tie up to preserve it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack coming on Sunday is out of his reach.
North Korea declares that it will not be unilaterally disarmed "in any way" if no signs of confidence are seen
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs reported to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were intensifying his mistrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "important good-will measures" in the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantleing the nuclear testing centre and committing themselves not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't observe any response in the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased denuclearization approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps gradually, its statements seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation of the whole, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US-in-Office president and a North Korea leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has tried to formally put an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang has to eliminate its nuclear weapons before.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that denuclearisation must first occur and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "declaration of the end of war," Ri pointed out.
“The perception that the sanctions will make us kneel is a chimer of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continuous sanctions are intensifying our mistrust."
Ri did not refer to the plans to celebrate a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this stagnation situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from what he held last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that pointing to the US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump called Kim from "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
Last year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage to take disarmament measures, but stated that there is still much to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Last Wednesday, Trump said that there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia maintain that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared to the UN Security Council Thursday that: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm the complete and definitive denuclearisation".
The Security Council has unanimously sanctioned North Korea since 2006 in a bet to cut the financing of Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that they had made advances, but soon North Korea accused him of making "demands of a gangster's own requests."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States took “consonance measures”.
He said Kim told him that the "consonance measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight the growing culture of studying throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar observed that students at university number one in the world are often dismissed from basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after making a talk about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, "Why do they tell me now, all this, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," reported The Telegraph.
In the course, first implemented this year, students are told basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said that the University decided to enter the course after learning that some students had a severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, of an hour of duration, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, babes and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects the lack of sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects it has on health smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and he added that modern technology and growing pressure that students suffer makes sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
To make sure to enjoy a sound of good quality for enough time should be a "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, tiredness and anxiety, he added, even to avoid winning weights, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in anion mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied Chemistry and Physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes the last year in his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to perform a similar program of studies before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light that emit electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team to one defeat for 1-0 in Livingston's home that supposes another hit outside.
Hebox's set was seeking to add his first victory home from the triumph of last February from 4 to 1 to St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team on the drift, at 8 points of Hearts, unstoppable leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to match the marker.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to third position, behind the Siberian by difference of goals.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as the judge of the Calum Spence line needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object that appeared to have been launched from the stage.
Gerard made eight changes regarding the alignment that the Ayr swept into the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same 11 headlines that took a point against Hearts last week, and he probably felt satisfied at the way his team, well-organized, suffocated his rivals at all times.
Although the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have marked the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scotland Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder shot astray and wasted the great occasion.
A failed launch of Keaghan Jacobs hit Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow made only one shot at the back pole.
The Rangers were made with control, but they seemed to have more hope than they had in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a 15-minute criminal signal, because he and Steven Lawless met, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only drove two jots into the first part, but the first porter of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the docile front Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi in the 34th minute may have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only for their efforts.
Again, the Rangers were not able to deal with Jacobs’ work.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the pause when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, the change had an impact almost immediately, as the extreme took a step at Morelos, even though Chief Kelly ran into the lockdown.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture visitors' attention by playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett doing long passes, one after another.
Holt's band could have given way to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a fight diverted from the horn.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton still demanded a last criminal for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made his eyes big.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that finally gave way to the device we know as "Geiger accountant."
Count Geiger, a pillar of science since then, also became a pile of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What day is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms emanating from radioactivity to minerals."
Evans: "You sure it's breaking up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize is malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer that was suffering for more than 18 months disappeared.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then reinjecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we've obtained suggest we have a promising vaccine."
Her2 protein "prones the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" in these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined in a pro-Trump diare with a MAGA cap after his performance in the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was written at the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance that he congratulated the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he'd be in the 2020 election.
After his third night song, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, he began to criticize the Democrats and to reiterate his support for Trump.
"I always talk to white people, they say, how can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate's Judicial Committee for the sexual assault complaints filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though he didn't issue himself, comedian Chris Rock went up recording West's disapproval on social media.
It's not clear if Rock meant to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated among the builders because of the hat he wore.
"They threatened me in the backseat.
They told me not to come out with that hat on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said Superman's cover would be put on so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked the public’s shouts at least twice, and the team members seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who told the publication: “The entire study was completely silent.”
West became the substitute for the last hour of Ariana Grande, the former one of which Mac Miller's rapper had died a few days ago.
West left much public perplexing with the interpretation of the song and Love it, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West got support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for getting in touch with the crowd."
But the presentation of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "existing who it is and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") that I think he adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and now it was "the former being known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His colleague raper, Snoop Dogg, before his name was Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music changed his name to a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man's punishment on Friday's East Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of First Instance in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
The throne game star, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of the Jon Snow Squad in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series of throne play.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of virile hero, claiming that these papers make it clear that young boys often think they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said that he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married the throne-game co-protagonist Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that she has strong determination to face this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we now experience?"
According to Kit, television can be a part of the responsibility of increasing toxic masculinity through its virile characters.
He added, "What is born and what is acquired?
What does it teach on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they must have this virility facet?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because no doubt something's been wrong with the young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he's full of battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will play a replay of Sam Shepard's True West work, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know her partner Rose is the best game she's ever given her.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life forward," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character representing Kit, Jon Snow, in an Emmy's fantasy series.
The couple entered their marriage in June 2018 at a family farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health care officers.
Only the second quarter of 2018 reported 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV for this cause has been almost zero, according to China's health officials' statements at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of the LGBT collective is common.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to lack of adequate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a employee has leaked data from senators of the Republican Party and disassembles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The L.A. Democrat claimed that the demands were driving them critical and far-right websites.
"Lives, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was published by someone unknown in the Capitoli during a session of the Senate's commission on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and revealing the information of a staff member of Waters, denounced the Capitol.
"This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this information filtering.
This unfounded denunciation is completely false and pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," wrote Fleischer.
"That makes him think he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get angry.
Shouldn't be challenged.
You don't have to question the accuser's motives.
It must remain calm and calm."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to overthrow Waters in the mid-legislative elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Importing if true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant security authorities and forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the criminals are revealed," continued, "and that they will be legally held accountable for all the actions they have carried out and that they have harmed each and every one of my staff."
Johnny's Criticism English Strikes Again: limited espia parody by Rowan Atkinson
It's tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this reposition of Johnny English's comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satire about how we are despicable will be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the incompetence of out-and-faced eyes Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time its license to twist everything, its name indicates more than anything else that is a comical creation designed for non-English speaking territories with tradition of going to cinema.
Obviously, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare pretensions of liquat glamor, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who gives a single note to the topic of Caros de fire at the inaugural ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally, it was based on Atkinson's mysterious and international traveler who was now forgetting Barclaycard television ads, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There's one or two good times on this last JE trip.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller's leaves were riveting him in the helmet.
You see the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems quite fluent and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems destined for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as clever or focused as the dumb gags of Mr. Bean's character representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the disquieting of the service agent, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretense and harassed figure, who is already suffering a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this pressed character of Teresa-May, but the script does not get any more.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as every active spy is in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And this includes the evil Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but teaching extra-official classes about how to become an undercover agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is returned quickly to Whitehall by an emergency meeting with its Bough-sequal sufferingr, a paper that represents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic paper, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin from when things get very ugly at Her Majesty's secret service come into action once more and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the tech billionaire charismatic that says he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous crazy people: disguised as waiters, burning up a French fast-food restaurant, creating chaos by smuggling on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, all together seems like a child program.
Pretty normal things.
As with Johnny English's other films, it's not helpful to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and covering five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business leaders to spend their savings with the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) giving workers a day's holiday.
Employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but they would get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The one-week shift works four days with the support of trade union confederation Trade Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labour Party declared to The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits the Party's perspective of balancing the economy for the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: "A four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
The shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also imply that shareholders of water companies might not recover all of the investment, since the Labour government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees together with companies and create property funds included to deliver 10% of private sector firms' shares to employees, who expect to borrow annual dividends for up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment for the Supreme Court at least one week, and has raised the question as to whether the findings of the agency might influence a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, the correspondent for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something into the light that made them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean it," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He stood firm, determined and secure."
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I would file an explosive charge," she said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it," I added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I name will be able to verify.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive program of stars, which carry out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition of this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy such activities as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to combat it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (treat someone wanting to pay a VIP entry), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to awaken consciousness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call for action or just a case more than we call "clickivism" (a people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, who have helped to achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than 37,000 million dollars, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2.250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, of which at least $10,000 million has already been disbursed or collected.
The group believes that for now protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the major commitments include the foundation The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and realists with them in the United Kingdom, which commits to "help children to grow as well as possible" and promises to send to Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a little page of history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on their website that asked "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied, "It'll be a long, hard way, sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights movements and against previous apartheid, we shall triumph, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will be performing at the youth event in New York, who will present Deborra-Lee Furnessss and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blocking" to block Russian energy exports.
Washington can, "if necessary" go to the Navy to stop Russian energy from hitting markets, including Middle East, has revealed U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates with the legitimate government's invitation, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent their energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at the event celebrated by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "energy consumer's voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are effectively equal.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, pointing out that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which cost $11,000 million and will double the existing gas pipeline capacity at 110,000 million cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure-driven tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, IDF (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to withdraw EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said she would "think carefully" her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she would "think detained" her candidacy for the presidency after the election of a middle legislature.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, the women hold high positions," said The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take my candidacy to the president seriously."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said "I was taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed that it should not be submitted by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said that the senator should not be presented, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed a wider support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator for Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would disclose his decision officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes TEPT Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after 11 September 2007
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"With what my own son is going through since he returned, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds with which our soldiers return," he told the public at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans: "they come back a little different, they get hardened, they come back wondering if there's respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged by domestic violence to a woman, with a statement by domestic violence and armed youth under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge to a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
18 state representatives and the district presented a friendly curiae in Washington on Friday to support a asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of Grace vs Sessions case demand that the U.S. Civil Freedoms Union presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent band member" attacked her, but the American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to ask for asylum.
The District Attorney General Karl Racine declared Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
The federal laws require asylum applications to be awarded according to the facts and particular circumstances of the demand, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the friendly curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies the entry of immigrants is damaging to the U.S. economy, as it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims who escape domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or a concrete political opinion," said Sessions in their 11th June announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never meant to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a spirit to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting more and more desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her child with fever in a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There's no drinking water."
Residents have seen themselves return to their destroyed homes to take in flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are treated outside because of the heavy shaking they repeat.
Tears denied her eyes as she explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where she was with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of stalking with "propaganda ads."
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump went to China Daily's payment supplement on Wednesday to The Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in elections at the US Congress on November 6, U.S.A., an accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections marked what North American officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify the pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to enter advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has seen to push spiders into mutual imports.
China's vindictive spiders at the beginning of the trade war aimed to punish state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and companies in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion paper at The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's redoubled the siege with the publication of advertising advertisements in our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of freedom of expression and free press in inserting an ad of payment to The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, at the kiosk that is down here in Beijing, you will find few discreting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens may have on China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women's voters before the Kavanaugh disaster elections, warn analysts
Since many of the leading Republicans support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing various sexual assault applications, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the forthcoming mid-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," explained Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the University of Syracuse at The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last hour pressure to carry out an FBI investigation is sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants called "November is coming!" as they manifested themselves in the Senate lobby while Republicans in control of the Judicial Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Ms. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've already been tall; it's true.
But they could have been more, especially among women voters of suburban women and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don't vote until they like the president."
Even prior to Ford's public testimony, where he detailed his claims for sexual assault on the candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative answer could be made if Republicans pressed with confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, an expression of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the vote of the board or the final vote, nor if Kavanaugh sits at the accused's bank, it's also about how Republicans have managed this issue and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of priorities USA, a group that helps to choose Democrats, on the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Star of Ford and the witnesses of Kavanaugh, with the balance that leans slightly toward the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in the Ford's testimony, or probably, while about 35 percent claim to believe in a doubt or probable Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or proved false during his testimony, while about 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's applications and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez complained that the candidate for the Supreme Court taught him genitals at a party while studying Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the web inventor is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where they store their data and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intention of Inrupt was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," said the emerging company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser at the same time.
What is excluded from the personal data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal power through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and skills appropriate for the Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work in the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been a voice influencing the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new web era," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Church of the Victory Cross of the I GM
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was beaten by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons staged a memorial tomb in a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's guarded proselyte.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns."
Later he ran into the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" made the row advance before he threw himself on a cannon with one hand and left three members of the detachment astonished.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a prowess that could never match, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a real hero is shown by support that he will receive from many people.
The fans of MMA who stayed sleepless all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you're awake all night to see Bellator 206 and you're denied the most important event.
San José's poster contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and they had to be live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the United Kingdom viewers were amazed when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some felt disgust when they stayed up all night until the morning to watch the fight.
A Twitter follow-up described the change in cartoons as "a kind of vomit joke."
"The government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, the vice-president of marketing and communication of Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pick the perch, yes."
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include United Kingdom viewers in the future.
"I think when I think of the repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there are six in the morning of a Sunday and we can't solve it until Sunday at our hour, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and they weren't all nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims he has grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the Desert Island Radio Discs 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father had remained important to him for winning the Olympics.
The regular feature of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months of sick leave.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck on Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "he was not socially acceptable like children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me power and strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high-profile LGBT promoter of the movement and has used its image in the Commonwealth games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world trip said he had fallen in love with a man, the American director, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "he caught me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 bigger than him, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you are so young (he took part in his early Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone as old as he has experienced.
The couple were parents in the June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, "all his perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked was if he already had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him to stop, you won't be there to fill the first row," she said.
"While holding his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that he was already dead, that I finally agreed he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that that was what I had dreamed of my whole life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in an Olympics.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small's Proud), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympics and still had his chicken skin on.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson got introduced to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
North American Phil Miccelson will be playing a record on Sunday in playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to become an unhappy fita.
Miccelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments divides his time between acting as an entertainer and working on his game in the field, hoping to correct what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult Le Golf National trajectory, where the long rush usually punishes the diverted blows.
And if his own journey is not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face the precious champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the beginning of the 12 individual games, they start strong, the Miccelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He fully understood his role for that day, made me a slap on my back and rolled me around with his arm while he told me he'd be ready the next day," Furyk said.
"You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
It's a Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained, and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will be past Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a race to Ryder Cup that didn't match its individual register.
Miccelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 draw, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has made the team intangible.
"It's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great teammate," he said.
"I think younger players also had fun dating him this week, which has been fun seeing him.
It adds a lot more to his game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that starting with considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team, run by Seven Ballesters, had a five-point advantage over the American team, but eventually won the win for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but shortly," Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the 2018 team victory for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score in 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members that are not over yet.
He's got to go to every machine tomorrow.
You have to go out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the dots go up on the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I told you, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also remember who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Enchanted with the performance of his players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with it.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to come out and get the best of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than on team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the last day's payouts, as he was part of the winning team on Brookline before he ended up losing in the Medina Miracle that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain of 1999, was motivated by his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start with good standing, as seen at Brookline and Medina.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We've prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to start resuscitation against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I have chosen this order because I believe it covers all possibilities," says Bjorn about his selection for individual clashes.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Army should have ended in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it would not at least do so until the coming year with defective systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesperson.
The ship should have joined Armada in 2014, but the post-building problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that Armada commissioned in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other features include longer periods of maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these ongoing delays imply that the advance ships, which were expected to be able to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was already reported last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to Drassana Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time Armada returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
There are few details of the reasons why it was returned, but the German media cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as about 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
Moreover, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Army to add improvements to it.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz will weigh twice as much of the same class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached a surprising EUR 3.100 million (US$ 3.600 million) from an initial budget of EUR 2.200 million.
The problems of the new frauds have become a matter of particular importance, taking into account recent warnings that indicate that the marine military power of Germany is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used."
The officer said the situation has worsened over time because they stopped using the old ships, but no one was provided again as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join Armada.
The National Foundation is spying on the secret life of the bats
A new investigation carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to find out how the landscape is used by the rappenites to feed.
Discoveries are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be soprano and common, as well as northern ear and water ratpenates in the Inverewe Botanical Garden in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track bat activity during the station.
Volunteers and staff from the United Kingdom National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Sound analysis of records by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed picture at the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation adviser from the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes that the results will show what areas of the habitat are more important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The ratpen population in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Construction and restoration of buildings threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, just like the killer paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to place insects and obstacles that stand in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the bats very seriously.
He has ten experts with proper training, who carry out surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescues in a regular way.
Even so, the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to bats at the farm Three Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight out of ten species of ratpenate of Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, claims it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a great area for the bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and still a good habit.
But we still do not know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are bats before doing maintenance work on property, as the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 women and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of a whole local population.
Ratpenates are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, harass them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scottish Ratpenate Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot from the bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the accusations of rape against him are "false news" and has claimed that people "want to be famous" by his name.
His lawyers will demand the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal's head and Juventus has been accused of violating a American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 for the incident not to be made public, according to the information published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video of Instagram Live addressing his 142 million followers hours after the accusations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five-time winner of the Gold Pilot in the camera.
"They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take my name to be famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which have qualified as "inadmissible information of suspicions about private life," according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damage due to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights violations in the past few years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino.
After he met at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the reports filed at the Jutjat district of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayor says Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy," except for "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual relations, but they were consented.
Mayorga also claims he went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later he agreed to an agreement outside the courts because he had "for reprisals" and he was concerned about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the deal, as she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to fix for the King Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he shot for the Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "always regret," if I lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary for Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worry" that the Toyota base in the United Kingdom had stated to the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in case of an unagreed Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point is that, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Getting out of the EU without an agreement on how trade will work with the rest of the EU has aroused the fears of other U.K. car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims that he will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider to be risks in the production chain in case Brexit had no agreement.
Toyota's production line is made on a "just-on-time" basis, with fish coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without any agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector believes could lead to delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and it should stop production as a consequence.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Checkers' plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
We want to get the best deal we can, as I say, not only enjoy today's success, but also take advantage of this opportunity," the BBC Radio 4 program said.
"Toyota's tests, not only, but also other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota was unable to confirm how long the production would stop, but in the long run, he warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallars, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the United Union on the plant, said members start to be very concerned about the situation: "For experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "posted for a week" while continuing the struggle over the appointment of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements of the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and help in Trump and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump fired or not the Deputy Attorney General and put Mueller's independence at risk, he's been fueling the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times already reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record Trump's talks and also the possibility of filing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors he was about to resign.
On Thursday, however, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York City.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to prevent a confrontation with the Senate's judicial committee that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which led to further delay in the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered the following: "Even if no date has been set, it could be this week, although it may be that it will delay another week for all matters with the supreme court.
I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists could refute this statement: Sanders has not had any briefing of the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like television reporters' puppetry, even though he said, "I won't deny they're gonna be fans."
He then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president does more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any source: "We've looked at this data."
Sanders said that the briefings will continue to take place, but "if the press has the possibility of asking directly to the president of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We're often trying to do this, you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the information sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press rounds with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press wheels are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and, at times, strangely in front of the gathered journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in the Scottish National Health Service on the basis of fears for Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter within six months of the EU's release.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of state-of-the-art residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and it still seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations for a possible unagreed scenario.
I know it's time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate now that I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and more importantly, bring valuable experience and stress that enhance and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting patients and communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency operation after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee State Tigers' reresilience has undergone an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information by Mike Organ, from Tennessee.
Coach at Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before half.
"He came to the band line and collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing it in a bunk and taking him to do more testing.
An officer from Tennessee State informed Chris Harris of WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at the medical center of Vanderbilt.
Harris added that "there's still no information about the type or extent of injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after it's taken from Illinois.
I had completed five plaques on Saturday before I left the game, which makes a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom with additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded on those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The survey hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
It is expected that a higher stamp tax on buying property in the United Kingdom will be charged to foreign buyers and that money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's move to attract young voters with promises of providing more affordable habitats that would affect higher returns.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded on those people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be allocated to the government's action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
It's waiting to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new construction properties are of non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many bountiful areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has asked for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the great constructions of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel assessments on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster."
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as control over renting and completion of "no guilt".
He also wants to give the joints more power to build new homes.
May said the following: "Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can't be right that it's just as easy for people who don't live in the United Kingdom, as well as for businesses with their own abroad, to buy housing in comparison to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home is too distant and the indignity of the homeless makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish has accepted the challenge of reviving the north-east club, which currently occupies the third position in the League One, three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St. Mirren to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as a supporter and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing a lot playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was little and it's always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I'm successful in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors at the Sunderland coach office include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The coach of Alloa Athletic claims that he does not feel the pressure to be next on a list of names enshrined in such a large team, after he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it's obvious that its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd only consider it successful here if I could get the club back."
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical body.
He helped Alloa avoid falling into the third category and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross claims he feels more comfortable now that during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"Probably it was a decisive moment," he remembered accepting the charge to Alloa.
"I always thought training was what was best given to me, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I came out reasonably and enjoyed quite good times.
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you have to overcome every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've heard since I'm a grown-up."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave fired consumption at Britain's bar with difficulties, but added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have increased by 2.7% in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of CGA's financial office, the company that collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sunshine and the participation of England in the World, which has expanded beyond expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to that of June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption in June restaurants has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have achieved the best results, while eating them in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer to eat have also suffered with the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
At the bars and taverns we have consulted, drinking sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, who is an expert in the field of occiology and hotel planning, said: "These results continue the trend we see since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to sales of the foreign market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% per annum would be especially harmful, rather than continuing pressure for costs.
This long, warm summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-serving trades and time will say if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide this much-needed breath."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including recently opened, has been 2.7% in July, given that it indicates slowness in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the established reference point of the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A poll of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "false Insta" pages
News has raised fears about publishing sexual content
20% of students say they have a "primary" account that shows parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, believe social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in the "insta fake" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the photo sharing site.
News has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
About 20% of students say they have a net "primary" account that shows parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager who urged others to "violate me."
The investigation, led by Digital Awareness UK and the Private School Steering Committee (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, half of which have admitted to have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "sights of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed a non-executive director of the Scottish athletic federation directive at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is the field athlete and track with more medals from Scotland and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from his dilated international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has respect for the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm looking forward to acting as an athlete's voice, and I hope I can grow the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympics and currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote the following on Twitter: "I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or to what degree.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's agile practice!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
An ad of bulldozers comparing mothers with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A scrapie company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an announcement that compares breast-feeding mothers with mutated cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered to be the "first silent tirallet that can be brought from the world", the technology company for the consumer Elvie has issued an advertisement inspired by a playful music video to show the freedom that gives the new tirallet to the mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ironing and cows at the rate of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I'm moving myself, but you won't see any tails" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not bragueres, but my breasts."
The tour continues: "Bomb, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, lug the girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom say it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and grow up to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after birth," wrote one person.
Elvie tirallet is hidden discreetly in a lactation supporter (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why don't you use them to announce a mother's handkerchief that their babies will keep?"
Another user added, "It's an out-of-place ad."
Other people defended the advertisement; one woman admitted that finding the song was "funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the trailer made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It's a great product," wrote one user.
Another person commented: "It's a fun announcement for mothers who bomb with bullets (usually at their place of work or in the bathroom and feel like they're cows.
It's not an ad to praise or judge the secular industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the tirallet quietly placed in the supporters.
The concept that lies behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use them.
However, Elvie's shin is completely silent, has no cable or pipe and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, which gives women more freedom to move, subjects babies, and even out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, mother's first childhood nurse and developer, said: "Elvie's tirallet is such a revolutionary product that I deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a tirallet is used and the challenges that it is supposed to do, while we demonstrated, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new tirallet.
This is not the first time Elvie's headline comes into the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the bridge for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrant children, quietly transferred to a tents camp on the Texas border
The number of detained emigrant children has increased despite the fact that monthly entry through the border has remained practically stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump have made it difficult to prepare children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid of risking their chance to stay in the country if they decided to take a child.
The risk has increased June, when the federal authorities announced that potential fathers and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs control officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to take unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
" Nearly 80 percent of the people who have taken in or live at home by a person who has taken in are illegal in the country, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
So we will continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
To process children more quickly, officers have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month after being detained, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by video conference, rather than by presence, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status in front of an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or escape attempts, according to the workers and reports they have given to the system in the last few months.
Advocates claim that such concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that because of its size, signs indicating that a child is suffering are overlooked.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Mualem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Muallem, also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war of terror is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displacements.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a war-affected country.
On the refugee issue, Mualem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational reasons" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition takes place to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone to the last great rebel bastion, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russia's assistance to the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem has noted that the agreement has a "clear termis" and expressed the hope that military action will face the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, sent from the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee formed by government members and opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and preparing the way for elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interferences.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, the scandals and the process of decommissioning ended with his presidency prematurely.
What would be, of course, "the end of a more dramatic presidency of history."
For now, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of full-time viewers has more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at maximum time, since the 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show", of theMSNBC, has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on the main informative nights.
"People have seen themselves in it because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, the executive producer of the ABC series "Designed Survival", about a cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told him I'd vote Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He answered that because he made her laugh," Scovell said.
There's an entertainment point in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you're in the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts debate the use that Bob Woodward made of "for private use" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar fur jacket ("a piece of thick clothes like his pride", held the Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let's say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes him seem to be part of a telereality program is that every night he gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" on the character changes and scripting spins of Trump's program (to fight with NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to lose an episode because you stay behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was closed looking at theMSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did those programs that were out of place then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it seems they were right."

External money inundates the races of the most adjusted elections in the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in cash in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of the congressional districts that have led two current members to compete in the same square.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburg involves Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who got the place in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were drawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed by January that the old districts were divided unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The competition for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial organisations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a special election held in March to represent the 18th Congressal District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on the Savior for their support in China, but they withdraw them.
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of US diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for the "new decisions on the failure to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert declared, spokesman of the department this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was contemplated, which in 2017 received US assistance of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would harm the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths for murder and arrest.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, which effectively ended with any probability of sanctions for the Salvadoran people.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration gives, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to their Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesperson from the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that the three officers described, including two diplomats, agreed to discuss internal discussions since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from anonymously, corroborated the statements.
Study History
The next event to take place could be the report of special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump to justice, of which there are numerous evidence in public records.
As far as you know, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in his election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be held accountable to the body, just when he is prepared to do so in front of the voters, and even in front of a jury of party members.
It's a lot of circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall, not one of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, the German officials were willing to take a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovacs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over such inflection points and accelerates or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing a number of inflection points today.
What if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been with water on his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not suitable for the charge.
Rosenstein claims the information in the Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite the credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, in particular, will we vote for a Congress that will make Trump responsible for this?
If we do not pass this test, democracy will begin to run into danger.
But I think we won't fail, because I've learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light candles from Saturday on that table with the stomach.
With this bag, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic towards the Vienna Rapid Party
The Rangers received the Rapid Vienna Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive quarter in the Vila-real camp this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the fourth 2-2 against the Royal Vila, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trap for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Real Village is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else out in the end, but in general, the fourth was probably a fair result.
They were better at the first part, but we were better at the second part.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it's going to be a hard game because they got a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we'll give it all and we'll get a good result with the fan support.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give everything, leave the season behind and succeed."
Women lose sleep for fear of savings for retirement
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking about it with the family.
About half of respondents at the national level say they talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10 percent of respondents say they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they don't dare think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance company.
We need to start here.
Talk to your spouse and your children about how you can prepare your family for not communicating your wishes in advance.
He works with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how you pay those expenses.
Your long-term care funding options may include a long-term long-term insurance policy, a long-term hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your own expenses or insurance with your own resources, if you have the money needed to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the pace in the legal battles.
Find a representative to be able to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical attention and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary authority for your finances.
It is important to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your old relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Specifies these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that has to be determined, but also with which doctors it is intended to be treated," said Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
Man shot several times with a compressed air shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots from a compressed air shotgun as he returned home after going out at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when they shot him in his chest, his abdomen, and his hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which occurred around 2.30 a.m. (in British summer hours) as a random act.
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is safe for the injuries and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities.
As communications are closed, relief units have not been able to obtain information from the Dogalga region, an area in the north of Palu nearest to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data on Palu and Dogalea, on the island of Heaven:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was on its 40th birthday, during an earthquake and tsunami.
Dogalia is a region that extends over 300 km of coast north-west of the island of Celebes.
The Regency, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Domgalea.
Exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Heaven.
Palu and Dogalea have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongalia.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in the west of Dongalia that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific fire belt and there are often earthquakes.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years have been listed below:
2004: On December 26, a massive earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which were in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Thousands died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude struck a pop zone in the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude struck one of the islands of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra, resulting in a tsunami of up to 10 feet [10 m] that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya’s regime in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the 2004 devastation of the earthquake and deadly tsunami.
This time, however, it did not produce a tsunami. More than 100 people died from falling buildings.
2018: A series of great earthquakes were produced on the Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, natural of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a well-known man tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled out his phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su provisional detention centre, where he is held with an unsecured obligation of 500 USD, according to KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, surely" when he was asked how he declared himself, according to this chain.
Palin's dealing with three class A flaws, which means he could go to jail for a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He's also accused of a class B lack, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time criminal charges are recorded against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
Her partner said she had given a punch on her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans for associating her child's violent behavior with a posttraumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a devastating earthquake on the Indonesian island of Heaven on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake took place right on the coast of Central Celebes, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media broadcast videos with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack who killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane from West Side Highway, the Lower Manhattan, and trolley traveling and cyclists during his journey, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, according to the warning of intent to seek the death penalty presented in the South New York district.
Both crimes could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-degree indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required a "significant planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the South New York district brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted by conspiracy to carry out spying actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked the ISIS flag to be deployed in his hospital room.
He has declared himself not guilty of the 22 wrongs charge.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to call for the death penalty, instead of accepting a conviction of guilt and a life imprisonment without the possibility of freedom will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Member of the Conservative Party's parliament says that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative party conference.
UKIP's previous leader said politicians should "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own parliament members suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP without charge Peter Bone told Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be out of the EU if Mr. Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when conservatives in favour of the union have filed another protest against Brexit in La City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to preserve Chequers' commitment plan between the attacks of Brexit's supporters, the Union's supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that they will reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure the Euroseptics and the Conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told Leave Means Leave de Solihull rally that he wanted to undo Chequers' engagement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed as a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out already,' she said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added, "I will defend Brexit, but we have to undo Chequers' engagement."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestion that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wants to stay is completely false."
Brexit Conservative party Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of the reporters, "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, that you listen to people."
"The compromise of Chequers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out into the street and get us to win some election.
Abandon Chequers's commitment and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added, "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that the politicians at the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the referendum in 2016.
"That, now, is a question of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't allow them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We're mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we won't rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Union’s supporters marched for Birmingham before holding a two - hour rally in the center of town.
A small number of activists shook flags on the conservatives against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for security problems that they suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus agreement, for the border without friction, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a brexit bo," he added.
Warren intends to examine the possibility of running as a candidate for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will examine the possibility of running as a candidate for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, presented himself for his re-election in November against the GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the deputy president of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It was the focus of speculation on the possibility of raising Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the format of an open meeting since Trump took over his office.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to run as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for murdering Sims, from the ULS
Baton Rouge Police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the death of the basketball player at the ULS Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET Press Conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and requested collaboration to identify the man from the subway.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a shot at his head that finally killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday in the media for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and get a shot at Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and was taken to custody of the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebots per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the title of the world after the team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas stood in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two occasions and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel got into boxing before and left Hamilton running in traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop in boxing and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after some wheeled action that caused Ferrari's pilot to leave the inside free with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third horner.
Max Verstappen began in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first time he was in the seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then went on to have a good share of the race, keeping his wheels to save time, move on to Kimi Raikkonen, and move on to fourth position.
Finally he entered the boxes at round number 44, but he couldn't raise the pace at the next eight times and Raikkonen was placed in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team did a great job to have an o-two," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday rally to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the candidate of sexual abuse.
In a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's witness in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "sick, cruel and lying."
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's going on in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, evil, cruel and lying people," he said.
"When you look at the communications and the filtrations and say "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?" "Hey, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered-- no, we didn't filter it," she added as she imitates the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and filtered in September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration proceed from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and kept it confidential, just as he asked me to."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? Her body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using statements for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, no matter who they hurt, who they have to attack for power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat of Friday in Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5 to 3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two - goal advantage through the finishings of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee, and then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season at Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth encounter of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan re-placed the home team in the game at minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitates the equalizer at minute 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the Giants' advantage at the first break when he got the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped, and again Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful goal at the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the game at the end of the second part and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next match on Friday.
An aerial driver dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake plane
An aircraft driver from Indonesia has become a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a massive earthquake hit the island of Heaven on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There's a lot of replicas going on in the area and there's a lot of people trapped between the ruins in the city of Palu.
But even though his companions escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grand, refused to leave his place in the tremendous control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure that the Batik 6321 flight, which was on the track at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he came out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This has broken our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while disaster mitigation agencies have reported that access to the cities of Dongalia, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the ruins and there are still many that have not been accessed," said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six feet [6 m], have devastated Palu, who will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial planes are bringing help and failures.
Kusuma Risa, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the deminercats have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against the clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the work related to evacuation.
Are you ready?", CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the accident in the pond
The airline operating a flight that's going to crash in a micronesia Pacific pond now says a man has disappeared, even though the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and the crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities reported on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane docked in the pond because the runway was short.
Some witnesses think the plane missed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was going very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to walk with water through the waist until the airborne exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and he suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who had worked close to it to improve a dock also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters inside the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people died in recorded aircraft accidents in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst makes up a story of the night that burned a woman alive.
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The analyst at the Paul Rowlett Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness to the intelligence analysis field.
He described the jury as using cell phone records to build the prosecution's 29-year-old, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when she said she was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said she had lied, because her truck was in Nashville."
Another incoherence was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicated that they had only been known for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defense intends to initiate its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held by the jury during the same day.

Another black person?!
NY maid asks a couple to fire after a "racist" message
A New York nurse reported a couple for a discriminatory assault after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother where she protested because she was "another black person."
The couple deny they're racist and compare the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed his dismay that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOO A OTHER NEGAL PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After finding out about her pygia, a "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and was later sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice calls on the couple to claim compensation for the dismissal and asks for compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month residence work for which they had hired her, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," said the Post on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the statements that they were racist while claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent you something I didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in someone's hands with whom you've been rude, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand to an "extortion," claimed that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like this?
Not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is still unresolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after she accepted the book, said in connection with the letter, "It's hard to put herself at someone's place that lly for the first time before her publication.
It's so funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book on a small red bear, was optimistic about the rejection of the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agredolce", after his death last year.
Describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and shows that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous man," he said.
"But since Paddington was as real to him, it was practically as when your son gets something: you're proud, even if it's not yours.
I think he felt that way about Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he used to recognize Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
On landing, they took their daughter quickly to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was very serious and they did not expect to overcome it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he told me he'd die in the next two minutes and I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll come with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs she had been given to keep her body beating and drinking and getting out of her system.
He had died before what was planned and so everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, for I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family members and more people.
I had to keep the right shape."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was going through.
"No one knew it," he said.
"He had a low head and tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for the overwhelming Nad.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I wanted her very much."
Sick women hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have killed themselves are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want any father or mother to feel what I have to hear every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, with Lydney's residence, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm continually concerned that there's a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know that there are people who can be approached, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said he was not well, nor was he depressed or anything like it," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched bottom on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
He said his death was a big trauma to them, but they have to work it out: "Open a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is waiting for a thread as the FBI starts an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday. He also added that he feared that the committee would be destroyed with the real death point of supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened in order to get the man who wants to be elected to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and pressing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as he was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to take the place and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea deserters "hunt" with Kim
The number of North Korea deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unity in the South, said that 1,127 desertions occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rising prices of human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Normally, most Northern deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrants, instead of refugees, and often returns by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Early in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep conversations focused on the negotiations stopped on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to get a Korean nuclear-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Affairs Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "histeric" and is not fit to work at the High Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the candidate for the High Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "histeric" and his temperament is incapable of working in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have told her it's a "histeric," said Pelosi in relation to his reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate Judicial Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the allegations that she had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and running out of words while talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the committee and said that the charges against him were a "gretish murder and coordinated character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that the witness in Kavanaugh showed that he could not work at the High Court, for he was showing prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's choice, if it's confirmed, and if Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, you're not only not capable of being in the High Court, but not in the court where you are now," Pelosi commented.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge at the Appeals Tribunal for the Columbia District Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he denied questions about whether he would cancel certain decisions of the High Court.
"It's no time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and expect it to seem wonderful to us," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diarrhage: months and years of abundant fury and can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon.
He continued... "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, telling the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it went on.
It seemed brilliant to me."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a masculine majority, where I ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of a bigger woman (a colder directive that had always terrorized me a little) who took me from the cliff and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll get you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democrat Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she told me as she laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said "Blanke and the seven dwarfs."
Since he was late for the campaign, he was late for the fundraising, so he promised he would not join the race unless he had raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she asked.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money and guiding voters, rather than the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he was left speechless.
"He might have thought he had a nervous breakdown," reminded Mrs. Schroeder about the press reaction.
"It might have been thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, "What will they put in my grave?
"Did you cry?"
How the trade war between the US and China can benefit Beijing
The initial rescues of the US-China trade war were overwhelming, and although the war does not seem to have to end quickly, a distance can benefit countries for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning at the beginning of this year, when he imposed taxes on China's main exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, with new spiders affecting products worth $200,000 million, and these spiders assume tax taxes on half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly countered in the same way and recently climbed the spiders from five to ten percent for 60,000 million dollars of American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the U.S. and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will come back shortly.
Making Washington back is going to yield to some demands, but bowing publicly in front of the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had predicted," said Abigail Grace, a leading researcher in Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of over seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their maintenance are fulfilled.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian help.
Al-Moulem said the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional help or assistance from countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's Selection Wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's selection has achieved the 2018 Ryder Cup in defeating the American selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European selection won the crown again when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, struck the water in the hole by 3 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari gleamed all his series and became one of the four players who achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated by a 5&4 player from the European Thorbjorn Olesen selection in Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5.
"I can't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so glad I got the drink back.
The team is the most important -- and I'm glad I could help," said a excited Garcia after the European victory.
He takes the lead in his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of the North American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual Sunday competition.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches he had in France and now has a race record in Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players who ever lived, with 14 big titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American selection fought all weekend to find the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I am proud of these players, they have fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressed the European selection.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's to take off your hat.
We've been defeated."
Red tide update: concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota

According to the FWC, more widespread proliferation conditions are being reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which suggests a lower concentration.
The proliferation of the red tide extends along about 200 km of coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
You can find spots 16 km from Hillsborough County Coast, but in less places, compared to last week's situation.
The red tide has also been observed in Easter County.
Average coastal or coastal concentrations have been reported on or off the coast to Pinellas County over the past week, concentrations of high-level downs at the coast to Hillsborough County, concentrations of background or highs in Manatee County, concentrations of middles in Charlotte County, concentrations of highs on the coast or away from Lee County Coast and concentrations of lows in Collier County.
Respiratory irritations continue to be reported to the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
