European inflation declined in food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the tedious growth in the price of foodstuffs.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering - after 2.6 percent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Union Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts only probably gave a 3 percent -- the Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decrease, along with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "have to negotiate" on inflation so that it will not later have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, beat the twelve-year record; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation occurred in the euro area as a result of the galloping food and energy prices.
Wheat-term contributions increased by 88 per cent and soy-quotation had reached its maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 black gold the barrel by now last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will fall from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, instead by 2009 it will decrease to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, it is expected that during 2008 the ECB will double the interest rates.
Gallup provides for a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Democratic Youth Alliance increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup had never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of the socialists.
The difference in the case of the parties' safe voters - due to the strongest firmness of the opposition voters - would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary seats: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Safe voters have one percent more supporters in both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially wrong, while another 46 percent believes the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population is affected by the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth is expected to improve.
In December, 71 per cent of the respondents, higher than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of Government was rather ill than responsible.
13 percent of the consultants trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of the consultants.
54 per cent of the population do not trust the head of government at all and 27 per cent do not trust the President of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the political situation configuration is that, what proportion of society believes it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October disturbances last year, 35 percent felt it would be desirable to retain in power the Government and the Head of Government, this proportion is now only 20 percent, while the relative majority (by 33 percent) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation responded that they would participate, and another 20 percent said that they were likely to participate.
Comparatively, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" it would certainly participate only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believe that their participation is likely. On the basis of the current intentions of the electors there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of education rights, 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we observe these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintuplicated its prices
They maintained the average price increase of 16 percent hypermarkets in Budaörs' commercial gold triangle, in contrast to the fact that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article of Napi Gazdasag
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in Budaörs' commercial gold triangle the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than the one thousand HUFs.
As in December last year prices in food supermarkets had already been "dispared", so there was no dramatic increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy at a price very below the 9,000 HUF last year, today they cannot do so even for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast net, cloud and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in the Auchan we also found a kilogram of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with two-litre redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even at the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the Napi Auchan basket was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to Christmas prices last year, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices on the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket to that of this year's cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that during last year's Christmas in prices there was an increase in VAT.
This process was precisely the one that destroyed trade, supermarkets visibly were unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of the movement of a product, he may lose a significant benefit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher by 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, whereas in the cheapest the difference was only by 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such extremes, as the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets more than 30 percent the price of consumer items of first need grew.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, in the case of some foods of first need, recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent in the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product which was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case, just 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, and could impose the drastic increase in prices even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the commercial gold triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers of the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, carrying the preserved food by pallets.
On the morning of Wednesday, the three stores formed large tails in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that inside the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because income is below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals you save with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, first of all, because of the improper application of antibiotics.
The conditions of hygiene prevailing in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overload of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the department-medical chief of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many hospitals it saves even with disinfectants.
A contact with MRSA has recently been diagnosed in the trauma department of the Hospital János.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital early in the year.
A serious car accident wound was released from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital as a result of the infection with MRSA and since then there has been no significant surgical intervention by the presence of the bacteria in her body.
Up to 10 December of this year, they have been registered in the Nosocomialis Surveillance National System 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents - said Karolina Böröcz, a medical chief department of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has certainly been recorded in hospitals, although no information is available.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-oxaclin-resistant.
One third of humans carry in their nose the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, amygdalitis, skin infections, wounds) respond well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is excessively or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that usually react well to antibiotics become bacteria that are very resistant to antibiotics and quickly contaminate in inadequate hospital conditions.
They may cause serious hospital infections, such as injuries or septicemia in the first place to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened body, to elderly or to persons with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic-resistant
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff take care of them in rubber gloves and masks and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients who are hospitalized are previously examined to check the presence of MRSA in their body, but it is not even possible to prevent infection in all cases.
You're not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA's hospital infections in most cases, however, the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of training and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - Karolina Böröcz says.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the patients taking MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals it is not fashionable to take microbiological samples.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most of the cases come out in public light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the department chief-doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union is rigorously commending the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological tables.
Antibiotic therapy should be directed, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance from occurring, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Taking microbiological samples is even less frequent in the case of travelling patients or in the primary care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Saving with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, they play a very important role in hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks, but also in this sense there are significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA was infected by drop transmission and direct contact between individuals, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately you can also experience - added Karolina Böröcz - that in less favourable economic hospitals you save with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are carried out, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the infection of the pathogen may be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
Treatment of contact with MRSA is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is being fought against.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
It appears that the program is successful, according to the data provided, infections with MRSA show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and that of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of alcohol from the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the 21st District Police Commander has been made.
It may be excluded from the possibility that he had been drunk or in a troubled state since then dismissed commander of the district XXII police, who on Tuesday ran and caused the death of a transluent - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case was prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of primary control of alcohol that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station in the 21st district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle by bending to the street Kossuth Lajos in the 21st district, ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(This last fact, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the rules of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always yield the step to double.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police officer resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was greatly moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Investigation Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian finance minister János Veres and the vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limits agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and the environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had already signed a credit contract of EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit contract is also used to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this target in Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later, by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the University of Debrecen innovation and research project.
During the talks they also covered the theme of the building of the 4th Metro line.
The agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalises with the EU the details of the Metro's financing, they will return to the subject which, if necessary or not to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the appropriations is in line with the EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the credit at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country before little mentioned.
What, where and those who buy on the EU's even cheaper market, will quickly become more important?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments of ski slopes and beach cottages.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for buildings also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Russia.
Similarly, the capital of Sofia, commercial and office spaces promise a quick recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, and can thus be a remarkable destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example around Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on Black Sea beaches and in ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to install here buy new or renovated buildings for a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old homes in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor is important.
The second category are the chalets buyers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital buildings is growing steadily, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have suffered an annual increase of 21%
The increase in the price of buildings considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fucker and six percent Hungarian
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, meetings at the expert level will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime post-2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world discuss the Bali Road Map, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the particulars between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not wish to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to reach the agreement that compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020 the emissions of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major issue of the conference is whether industrialised countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are prepared to provide material and technological assistance to countries in need.
A further agreement was reached on aid for developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a board of directors consisting of 16 members, probably within the Global Environment Facility of the UN (GEF) - writes the "Piac is Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent to 2020, with respect to the 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the "after 2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to commit to reducing even 30 percent if the other major developed regions in the world and developing countries are also willing to take commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 per cent, in which the 15 EU Member States then committed to achieving an 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce by 6 per cent the greenhouse gas emissions from the period 1985-87, which our country will meet - notes the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is a great deal of what is at stake in Bali, since within two years it will be necessary to sign the long-term international climate policy agreement, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed by after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was warned in its most recent report by the United Nations International Scientific Partnership dealing with climate change, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
As a result, emissions reduction would be delayed and an increase of more than 2°C of the average temperature of the Earth could not be prevented, which according to scientists would have unsurpassed and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings of filmed actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: Special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These tapes made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general body of Kandahar operations, then sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
139 recordings from air force soldiers have already been loaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "Headquarters Defence" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the British Community (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence, they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs virtually nothing compared to conventional recruiting television spots - told the BBC the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead, inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason to be of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans set up a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the tapes carefully edited and censored, there are also amateur videos in the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, officers talk as much as possible about losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have been uploaded to the Internet from the battle camps in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army has only recently been taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different way to recruit with video shoots, which can be downloaded for free, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can be placed directly instead of the soldiers.
Tombola and pastelillo salted at the Christmas feast of the ministries
The Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to bid off in 2007 with a salad and coffee cake.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its feast with live music, in another will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so fun the power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The largest Christmas festival will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry's workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts and the Christmas of the Missionaries will be invited to the families of the soldiers who are currently serving missions abroad. A reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the holiday environment at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and the six hundred workers of the ministry are expected to be present at approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the portfolio party will reign an atmosphere of Christmas, will also act artists and will be drawn from tombola.
The NAF's ship cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinners.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers in one of the NAF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA since we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the NAF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas held the dance of Lucia's day on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them did not collect anything for the use of their facilities.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s greeting, and after dinner there was live dancing music.
In reply to the [origo] question they reported: to attend the dance was not mandatory to dress or dress at night.
Health, work, and local government portfolios are being prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for your workers in your own building with a budget of HUF 400 000.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not expect his colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year working meeting.
There are hundreds of eighty guests who - as the press department will report - will take just coffee and pastry salad, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, instead, will simply offer with his colleagues at the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas festival in its own theatre of events with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the hour of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year reception on January 20, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple front desk, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas celebrations - this is what the corresponding press departments communicated to [ore].
In the environment portfolio press department, they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering together
The League Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will form a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike on Monday that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stop will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as the rail traffic will be fully stopped and until 13 hours workers from the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
In the afternoon of Friday, the Unions of the League will report on the details of their strike on Monday, which will be held jointly with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
It will also be the strike commission of the LIGA and the National Machinist Union that will coordinate the actions of Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will be pronounced on strike for indefinite time, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves the law of public health, the unions will immediately withdraw their appeal to the strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda for Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only the public health law is voted on in the very early hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will have to be significant difficulties in transport: in the railways it will no longer work for an indefinite time, in the morning it may be that part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban bus transport of Volán companies.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for defined time.
Until the afternoon of Thursday, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on minimum services, but as Christmas parties approached, more and more people were traveling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, the Budapest airports from 7 to 9 am, will hold a four-hour strike for the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Educational Unions called a strike from 2 to 8 hours and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS) who are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour strike for warning.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal on public health reform and submits a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation which will enter into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for advanced pensions, the possibility that occupations that deserve it may enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect a different proposal.
Political Capital[b1: The risk of the Hungarian Guard increases in the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Capital Policy, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August this year with the support of the Better Hungary Movement, has increased from a number of points of view the political risk of Hungary and the region.
The company's "risk warning" is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of the ethnic tensions existing between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocation of an event of this character - the representative of the research institute added.
They stated that all of this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life handed over the public debate of the Roma problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians."
This aggravates the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
Moreover, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country".
They remind us that, as of the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of the radical and extreme-right-wing groups of Hungary has been increasingly publicized and boosted, and that since the summer of 2007, many organizations have been established in the country as self-defining as "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for the defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, defence of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, of the State" - they add.
They stated: all of this is in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
It is not only useful to highlight the civil and the form of partnership in the case of these associations to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighborhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the establishment of the Hungarian Guard,
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way that for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of the far right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "Gypsy Terror" in Bulgaria, however, the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to lively discussions in Bulgarian public opinion.
As was written, it indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will be their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of the Capital Policy.
The Research Director of the Capital Policy, Attila Juhász, at the news agency's question, stated that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis each year and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their warning on risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or North America are a unitary party.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national parties, state parties and holidays.
The holidays are essentially related to religious festivals and historical ephemerals.
Let us celebrate the New Year also: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter above all so that they can rest those who spent celebrating the old year.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national festival on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on 23 October, the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August we celebrate the foundation of the State, on 1 May, the feast of work, on 1 and 2 November we remind our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country, two-day celebrations are the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often done when there is only one working day before or after the party.
In exchange for extended weekends so, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
He is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in return for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory, on the other hand, for companies and service institutions that, because of their function, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work can be changed only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24th, life in the country is practically stopped, as according to experiences, most people "strengthened" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year, several of our parties will coincide with mid-week or weekend, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The agenda will first be modified around the work party so that, for four days thereafter, workers can rest.
On Saturday, April 26th will be a working day, so that on Friday, May 2nd will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the celebration of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, work will have to be done instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year coming during the end-of-year party will be able to rest, since from 24 December it will not work in almost any part, nor even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little children's deterrence to bitter your colleagues' lives
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never received, innocent lies that pass us through without realizing: they are all part of our everyday Folklore" at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to small nuisances or consciously avoid confusing situations that might irritate others.
Tips.
Excuse me, if I forgot to tell you they've been looking for you from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go to an appointment?
At best you feel it and try to fix the matter, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the less usual solution).
Most of the time, the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before we proceed to some kind of explanation, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can water your colleagues' lives and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, an office tool or your phone and you don't find them.
Remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your pen lost on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they're going to be very angry with you for taking your stuff away.
Do not grab envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and wear out before time.
You're whispering about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and who?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (conjectories) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Enter into yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even though others know the things about him.
You're on sick leave unwarrantedly?
When you call the office on the phone and say you're sick and you're insufferably hurt your head, you feel bad or, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your job, your impossible tasks, your work at last.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to the office or something can happen to you, so you have to stay at home, comms, so your colleagues or your boss don't have to face you the next day.
Tarreos, laughter, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but you get rid of him with the laughs of your colleagues?
Have you inadvertently heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your drummers, songs, loud conversations (less when you do them above your head), Patals, constant blasphemies, expressing your discounts in your loud voice.
All of these can be annoying, although they are not deepening at the moment in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Don't mention the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Are you feeling too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: I live very comfortable for the house, but it's not suitable for the office!
You don't see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be disorganized, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so demands!
Lose interest if you want to meet public expectations
The car moves slowly in the usual morning jam.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm going up the volume.
Change the rhythm of music and the previous tones adds the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the Wings of Love song in Zagar.
National musical life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks completely different this jam when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
It appears Yonderboi. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national little by little are changing the image and although again it is fashionable the rock style garage, breaks guitars, the national pop electro has shown: there are developments under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi as a whole until he started his independent career maybe because they can't both be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, electronic music dancing and pop, he tried to triumph when they asked him for soundtracks [b4]cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the set that at first acted only in small clubs when the Win2 magazine selected its first album published in 2002 among the 50 most important national records, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of also selling in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his whole are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether they wear this label or not.
The set reacted the way it should react: it prepared a new and even better record.
The recently released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
It's all right the reference on the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy of music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the record at the Millennium György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the mr2 Petõfi channel that lately transmits from morning to night popular music. This station took the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
For everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: what are you interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of selected audiences for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of caste in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: In abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has greater traditions.
Here not only the fifteen-and-twenty-year generations frequent the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that take place around them in light music, because they consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we never composed music for the market.
We don't make music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music with that of him.
Instead, we work as a team, rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and from there we started another way.
hvg.hu: On the success list of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people heard Zagar's name for the first time in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make great successes and sell with these successes our record.
This song is something more than that.
We add it at the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sounding orgy of the disc and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a chorus in the gospel style.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of soloists in good voice from our own national music stage.
Thus was created that choir of six women - i.e. Sena, Kuzora Edina, Jude Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was later baptized as Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you make exactly the song or the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the disc, we thought there was still something missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came almost to the first attempt and incredibly spontaneous.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I needed the Divas too.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the disc looks like girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role to play, they sing together and not more strongly than music, so the music doesn't just accompany their songs.
Also on the stage are located at the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They're in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute roles of soloists.
The song also covers it, about which we forget for a while our ego, who who from where he came from and where he goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted others to feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What did you devote more work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition to none, but in the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, little by little everything got to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already "solved" the disc.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous bag runner risks billions because of its inferiority complex
Disloyal evil.
This is how your former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker of Société Générale, also owned by the Czech Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros for it.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
It has long been intrusive, unlike all the major Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He had a fragile character" he let himself be heard from his superiors, the same ones that sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's responses according to what the French media, such as the Le Monde newspaper, is that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1,600 million euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
In the summer, it managed to win during the American crisis, EUR 500 million.
This opportunity has already come in early this year.
In February, some news about the sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or to those who in the past had problems with payments and that these customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not have affected the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe him and he betted correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded €1.6 billion.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had faked the records in such a way that he did not come to his discovery.
He even cheated on the bosses, even when the Eureka Stock Exchange began to take an interest in their business.
The risk became beneficial
Was I afraid he'd come to find out?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had earned 1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to risk yourself like that?
My position was to work gradually.
He joined the General Society in 2000, right after he finished studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was handled in the amount of $51,000.
Two years later he was already a Bolsa runner assistant and in 2005 he became a scholarship runner with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew that I would never win as much as the others did.
"In my first interview in 2005 I already observed that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But soon after my entry into the company, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, during the bombings in London, he won a €500 million discount.
And this was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll let you.
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the chiefs knew about all this or that they suspected it rather.
"While making money, they closed their eyes."
It's just that, after that, the blow came in early this year.
In one day it lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to erase every trace.
When Monday came to work, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they manage to locate him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The corridor that has no vacation is a corridor that doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file" Kerviel finished.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to achieve 365 billion
The Ministers of the Czech Republic signed with representatives of the European Commission yesterday a total of nine operational programmes of which the Czech Republic can achieve EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is almost half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Out of seven operational programmes will result in approximately 125 billion crowns for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be devoted to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state transport infrastructure fund that next year will have the amount of 90,800 million crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly introduced countries that use them less.
Twenty-year sentence for the former president of Nicaragua, decreed the court
The Nicaraguan Appeals Tribunal issued a 20-year sentence on Thursday for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Aleman, who was sentenced in 2003 to the breakdown of $100 billion (approx. 1,800 million crowns).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his farm not far from Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is once again in a row.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez will rely rather on prison officials if they let German finish his punishment at home or if they return him to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German constantly passed government money on a company's account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest family and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Germany created to finance its campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drawn up by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because Minister Sobotka and ČSSD were prepared to refuse to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, although the most influential, calmly approved the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget heading, likes or doesn't.
The budget is an important part of politics but in it there is a hidden rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore devotes special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than just numbers.
The State budgets of the last Governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three shortcomings that for this year 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenditure of representatives who are not only pensioners but also the social benefits that have already been approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first flaw.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit in the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors in order to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the taxes, taxes and credits of the banks, often issued disproportionate obligations with which they owed disproportionately to their municipalities.
In recent years they have been able to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy actions and other development networks that received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this appeal.
If we only adhere to official facts and verified, we discover that:
Our economy, a few years ago, goes through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which ČSSD is jettisoned.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to order the state's finances.
However, instead, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the countries, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, into the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been inexhaustible in recent years with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate part of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon it does not change the retirement age and pension reform then it will be the end of any policy in this country and, to rule who rules will only be a simple bureaucracy.
By demanding a little, we can say that the ruling politicians will be transformed into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal spending of the agents.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by the year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want the ruling politicians to become only officials, so we must be patient and grant to this weak coalition of governments, which realizes that the state can only spend what is capable of obtaining taxes and fees, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
The Monetary Marking will receive more than a hundred billion dollars through tenders.
In these tenders banks underestimate the interest rates by which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will bid $40 billion, and then another $25 billion will make it easier for the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the 11 September attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the lack of free capital that banks could lend" wrote in his report for customers, Bernard Baumohl of the Business Consultant Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action of central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent" added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what they are still waiting for when they decided to take this step," said ABN economist Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and will therefore have to lend more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, the London interbank tariff used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall of interest rates," said Reuters agency, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Ecological debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his Blue book, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, they are artificial fires of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my ideas."
Interested persons can now be informed of their varied views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, capable of following and judging a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that on the warming of the planet there is no agreement among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose the unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
The questions presented repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable advocates of the environment but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
From the same topic, Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people didn't get to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and therefore failed to change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for the change so that officials can give them from time to the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year's, hundreds of thousands of drivers are on the roads without the valid carne.
According to traffic, the sheep have not changed it mainly those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While the peoples announce a rapid decline in the change of meat, the metropolis offices are full of applications and the interest for the new meat has increased.
The City Hall calculates about 2,000 customers per day.
The queue is waiting for half an hour.
In Prague some 140,000 drivers have not yet been removed.
The issue of a new sheepmeat lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay fifty crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their money and do not reach the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid card will risk a fine from January onwards.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the breach with a warning.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine shall amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a fine may be paid to a person who does not go anywhere.
They could allegedly pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry called on the offices to enter at most moderately fines of 1,000 crowns.
According to the voice of the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the driver's license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the meats issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers should be slowly changing the other types of driving gear.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 are up to three years old to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalty for the conspirators of Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided as a final maturity the reduction of penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives in the department were going to complain about organized crime, in the beginning, between 14 and 12 years of age.
Against today's decision no longer can be resorted, only by the revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused but he is primarily awaiting the judgment of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other cases, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized participation in the robbery of 19 persons and today the higher court revoked 16 of them.
Most of the charges of the accused were rejected by the investigation because of the fact that they were invented cases.
According to the Senate of Central Bohemia, police members in accordance with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid punishment.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The charge concerns criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft was concerned, their victims suffered serious health impacts, but they were also accused of the abuse of power as public agents and without arms permits.
In the home register, the police found guns, steel core ammunition, laser conductor and machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of almost twenty men in this process, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pět and Maroš Šulej, who for now have avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account for changing children: 12 million
By changing children in the maternity home, the lawyer of the families concerned, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each mother, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, one million.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, does not in principle agree with Veleba's proposal.
"That demand we didn't approve, it's too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the expert's report that the counterpart asked to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a recissory value.
We keep in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostal said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň's family wanted, for every month, that they didn't create their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that the expert was prepared at the Motol University hospital in Prague.
The parents of girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress at different levels and depth.
The situation of stress was better borne by men even though they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women are taking it worse with the trauma they are now experiencing and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Maternity House of Třebič last year, on December nine.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Verónica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered at the end of October to each family 100,000 crowns as compensation for the error committed in the hospital of Třebič that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are secured by law as liability for damage.
In case of errors, they must be removed from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask the administrator for help.
The court so far recognized them with proportionally low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables of hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly one million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Kingdom of Valaquia brand.
According to the judge of the Provincial Court of Ostrava was the first to use the Kingdom of Valaquia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polyvka was not presented to the oral eye today.
According to your lawyer, the cause is probably not over and your client will resort.
"The dispute consists of Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polivka," said the lawyer of Polivka after the trial.
For him, in the words of the Kingdom of Valachia, the image of the actor and comics comes to everyone.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us for about ten years.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is in the money.
"After years, I have realized that the project is successful and that for that reason I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Valaquia brand was first used by Polívka on his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about guiding him toward the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš was asked to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that comic origin, it was a lucrative business and business of which Harabiš later created the Kingdom of Valaquia company.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to use his name and sign in passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors from his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš used only a simple idea that Polivka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team devoted to it completely.
The collaboration, among today's broken-down parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation in Vsetín for Polivka.
From that point on, conflicts began between Polivka and Harabiš, whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, came to the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed an accusation against Harabiš and his society which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clearly could bring in the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We're in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polivka can introduce himself," said Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
Actually, I've never liked Peugeotu too much.
Their gear features were never special, the quality of the change box, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now on the market his successor, Peugeot 207, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I just think it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the space of the head in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combo bodywork means in this sense, that I'm not going to suffer before two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I'm going through the interior quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the invention of design even though the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained of short seats and backrests.
Also unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the bodywork have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned shortage of space in the head disappears.
Suitcases in case of case
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
This must be valued as very accessible (thanks to the abable rear gate) and a well distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that provide an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, the basic system has a capacity of 428 liters, which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the vehicle of the same type most sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, we find out that Peugeot remains behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or by placing the child's chalice its value is critical.
But if I had to say something positive then I have to quote the floor that is pretty flat after cutting down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our test car was equipped with a four-valve injection light on a 1.6 l capacity and a 88 kW force.
And to tell the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 that looked down on the family five doors.
It is silent, it consumes little and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the škodas then it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was covered by a rag, I can say that I can be impressed with it.
Prices are answered
The car price is not for all pockets.
However, we must bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with 1400 injection light per 329,900 crowns, is still possible.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags in the headings, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreens, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but it's about the team's complements in Fabian and it's going to get to a pretty similar number.
Now you just have to decide which one of the two brands.
Slovak students are not enrolled in English schools
In English schools children from Eastern European countries are assisted, and for this reason locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Europeans from the east for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children are increasing in violence.
The problem of integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and tantrums among students have already reached even parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was sticking sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In his defense he said that the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two younger girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls gave him racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to leave him, he made us the master of throwing apples and pears, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his ass," he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with the emigrants of Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are registered 70,000 Slovaks who came here for labour reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and all enclosed with shrimps offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only one island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of America's conquest.
Column called her, the most beautiful place the human eye has seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He ordered to build one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, since all that was criminal in the US (and therefore forbidden) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana tall buildings emerged, by broad avenues the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century ran.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita left its signatures the world stars of the show and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Abananese Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel National you mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already of worship of the 1950s, so far continue to work for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that have arrived long ago have been oxidized between these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old neighborhood, has deteriorated dramatically, there is no such wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are metamorphose in beauty, for example, Trinity.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly valued by the railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from huge plantations to narrow-track sugar factories in steam or electric machines.
His carriages for dozens of years were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose fraternal models in other parts of the world are only found in the museums.
Where to go?
The most popular place for most visitors does not change.
And for that, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that on the already mentioned Hemingway farm there is a museum that for those who are a lover of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exhilarating vegetation that grows on limestone rock lands.
Mogots, limestone piles and high cliffs in the valley falls, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized through which rockes are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where, probably, the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the pure-brown factories can be found with your final product.
Maybe someone looks interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Old-fashioned town that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the sierra de Escambray, is a place so distant that in the 1950s of the last century there was no road to join the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built, and for that reason, nothing was destroyed, because each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in nearby surroundings such as the Ancón Beach or the sugar factory valley.
The evening belongs to the House of Music, which encourages the silence of the mornings with its music.
Baracoa
Small town on the west end of Cuba, some view it as the most beautiful one on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the Colón Cross (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, puros, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Cochinians and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Copper Charity, the Santeria, the African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, of all this many pages could be filled.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it once.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, the Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed are what is influencing the march of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as expected, the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country coincided in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to pursue greater activity, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is to make it possible for the population that they can only start economic and security development," said the BBC Defense Minister Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to American army data is greater than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions grew as compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in the Helmand province up to 60 percent.
The NATO countries have some 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which the fourth part is in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, the allies have reached the same limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
They ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly today, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I am not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have a ninety percent of soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters agency in closing the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
Among the participating countries in recent months, there is a controversy as to whether all the allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
He was passively criticized, for example, Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the fight requirements there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
Sun sensational newspaper this week called the German soldiers vague.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys fight," wrote Sun in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where British troops played a rugby party in southern Afghanistan.
The government's debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each check the state must have 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to 842,700 million crowns in September.
This year the government planned to lend 159,200 million crowns.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns through the improvement of the state budget economy.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew by the end of September to 842,700 million crowns.
In nine months of this year it increased to 40,200 million crowns.
Since June, however, there has been a decrease of 13,400 million crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economics confirmed its data on the debt of the early October state.
For each cheque, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could cross the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900 billion and the billion crowns," he said for the iHNed.cz server, economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, sees it as well: "We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we do not yet know.
If it was seen that the situation at the political scene would change and politicians would be able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But such a change I don't see it," he added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and comes, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The debt of the state is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct credits or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal indebtedness grew this year from 38,500 million to 719,400 million crowns.
External debt has now grown from 1,700 million crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803,300 million z crowns since June was reduced by 13,700 million crowns.
The average government debt maturity increased by 6.5 years.
"The total inter-annual debt from the first to the third trimester creates 13 percent of what is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated above all of the obligations where there is a 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," said Pikora.
Better than expected
From the state's payment and debt management strategy for 2007 it is drawn that the government planned this year to lend 159,200 million crowns.
In early December, the ministry decreased the plan by 152,800 million crowns through improved state budget developments.
Above all, the amount is made up of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the projected 91,300 million crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13,300 million crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payments, 43 billion crowns to finance state obligations and 1,800 million crowns for payments from European Investment Bank loans.
He was comparing today in front of a court in Jartúm to have given a name to a teddy bear
The British professor tried in Sudan to insult Islam on Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartúm 15 days in prison and the expulsion, said his lawyer.
The British was accused of having left students between 6 and 7 years old to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when all representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was subject to a beating penalty.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based on the Unity High School in Jartúm in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday in her home and charged with the attack on Islam and seduction, under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's stuffed bear.
" Eight names come out of the mouth of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children in 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the bear photo with the following legend: "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm sorry that he only asked the children to vote for a name ", it's only an " innocent mistake " according to him.
Opinion divided by numerous students from the school teacher who describe it as " very attentive to their students " and " who never speaks of religion in class " .
Let's remember that the name Mohamed is also the second name most often given in Britain, written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules for the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement," stated European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period," he added, pointing out that " evident tensions exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, regrouping the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated by 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika had been responsible for a new mediation by the United Nations in August.
The United States and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this high date.
"Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on an increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found " , announced the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where these "last chance negotiations were held since Monday".
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given some of his regrets.
But he added that the self-government plan presented by Belgrade " belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
Serbian President Borís Tadic has considered on his part that a commitment was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade said particularly to fear a " dominating effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that an engagement is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament shall have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
Journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush broke out an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of his own international peace conference on Tuesday to Annapolis in Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common statement.
It required that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with a view to finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old litigation point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything to help them complete a "peace deal" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must put an end to their colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations to the peace journey they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would " attempt to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main pelagic problems of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the conflict in 1948.
Speaking after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things " .
Upon his return to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the forthcoming negotiations were "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the end of his " two-State vision " Israeli and Palestinian States that co-exist at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , says Prince Sauud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Like every time in this kind of event, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the French National Police Inspectorate (PGI), a police car circulated on Sunday, shortly after 17, Luisa-Miguel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but in patrol, and I was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating lighthouse," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left, after a failure of the exit the step to the right," the police said.
The alcohol control of the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (the front unfurled, windshielded windshield, shelled parachute) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into " acts of involuntary homicide and denial of help " to the IGPN, co-coordinated with the Department of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, they confirmed " the police version, namely that this mini-tocycle arrived relatively quickly to its left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the rustling of the footwear on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been trapped the time to get the police car to slow down.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims have been autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, not providing relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious fault " concerning this point.
" It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more research, on which to be very careful, " a police source was required.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that gives the scene precisely.
"We then, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, try to revive them, tell this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a fully frightened policeman, who was grasping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, apparently, to the certainty that the people were present in the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
Always according to this witness, the rescue arrived " about twenty minutes after the march of the police " .
They also practised cardiac massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young men have been rescued.
The firemen arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed on his part.
The tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, to the east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency have been wounded by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
These last replicas were shot with stones, wounding the cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been interrogated.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police carried and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement collected on Monday the support of religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president " urged the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of emergency and the wastes they swore to in front of Musharraf " .
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
" Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court judgements," the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army head and become a civilian president " no longer " after the establishment of the state of urgency, declared Monday to the assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Information Minister also confirmed that the January elections could be transferred.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not expected, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
The different contraceptive methods such as the pill or the sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraceptives, however, allowed a better "domain of fertility", according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years is increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births of every ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple of every five and if possible for spring, judged season as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours of space work to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew colleagues at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform spectacular repairs to a broken solar panel and indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its removal from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "headed" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Discovery launcher from the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece to host the European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for processing modules.
But we have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a solar panel power production module weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module with a height of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds as chords, has been damaged in a little more or less than one meter by a wire that has been trapped.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
Astronauts, who initially had to perform a check-out of the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to caracle at the end of 30 meters in length of the remote-directed arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) of the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the torso very developed and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been responsible for the "inherited" solar panel.
After inspecting the damage precisely, he checked the falsible cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " that had stayed close to the air exclusion and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool you used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "chapuceeded" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was finished, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts were taking advantage of an afternoon's rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launcher for the planned return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently under way in the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautical and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with A400M's delays.
EADS currently loses 4 % to 21.96 euros in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays due to slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which provides for the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of eliminating the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is " between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion of which more than EUR 1 billion for Airbus " , announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the result of exploitation (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, add without any more cryptic accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS failed by 86 % in 2006, essentially because of loads linked to the delays of another programme, that of the very heavy carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming its aspiration for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
On three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today directs voters a televised message about public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory reveals itself overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting to deliver a new burden against the West accused of interference - his theme of choice during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest elections, more transparent and more open, elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
Denounces a campaign whackled by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there has never been such a dirty election until the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of the demonstrations of the last weekend, the former world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days' imprisonment for unlawful demonstration, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two more open questions:
Who will happen to Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Selected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever the case, legislative elections such as the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
" The Russians kept the minds of the Soviet homo, they don't feel the owners of their destiny," says Sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada independent center.
Historian Nikolaï Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University went further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin restored the model of a paternalist state, which was perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic shock " , Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " give up on their own will to the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved after the collapse of the USSR.
"What to reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of Russia united.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, neither will the extremists vote.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " For what to reflect?
Those in power aren't too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million file documents, stored on 27 km of shelves at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not available here only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of an old victim or of his rights.
The 11 States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to the researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratifying this agreement by all States has been completed, openness has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to make searches " particularly about the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers " , explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, had opposed the opening to the public of these nominee documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the countrymen deported or subjected to compulsory work and, where appropriate, to give them proof of their detention, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected of these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on AntiSemitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Today, indo-European bilateral trade is already reaching around 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, pointed out to the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union's Foreign Ministers had given their approval last April to the European Commission to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in order to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea, and the Indo-European bilateral trade is now about EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will do a lot of both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants change annually by " 47 billion euros of goods " and by " 10 billion euros of services", he declared this week Daniele Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential". The European Union and India are on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The bank in England on Thursday was concerned about relieving the current return on credit conditions, and announced a ten billion-pound offer to the basic index of 5.75 % in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" To alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of their planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , indicated in a communiqué.
The bank states that EUR 10 billion (14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12h 15 GMT, the basic index and up to 10 January.
It's the first time it seems that the Bank England BoE puts in the liquidity market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that " it is prepared to take other measures to maintain the " interbank-to-day indexes " with its basic index.
The interbank index per day was on Wednesday of 5,829 %.
The rate after three months was set at 6,6 %, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with an important rate of penalty which had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, supported by the evolution of the euro exchange rate, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the examination of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre group refused to discuss on Thursday articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to a rejection of the text.
The text contained in a socialist "nicket" (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group), declined a decade of action taken on Tuesday by the national PS office, including an increase of 50% of the surplus for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (inland rate for oil products), a check-transport or the restrictions on rentals.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the examination of articles (180 items versus 115), the meeting was held at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition to a few hours of the televised intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has inspired, no less, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres to approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
At another time known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Henham Park Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the " most inspiring event " that he has never seen, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic by this project.
Unfortunately, we're stuck in low-class policies because of the current administration, it's after Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival at an exceptional place that, lately, takes place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after dismarking in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours are done more in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of a peasant festival in the European and urban way to the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The community of Vineland, including the mayor, eagerly supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but affirms "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that we hope will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", like that of the 80 000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been thrown to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His colleagues from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Faces Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood film dishes into Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the task of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the " runaway productions " .
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," she says.
The festival race
At the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskars is started.
All festivals in the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give them courage and ensure that the filmmakers hold interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in the portfolio of Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally in stock? Experts, divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks to fire the closure of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to be produced.
Banif believes that "from the statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to carry out forecasts based solely on statistics, even more because, in the current context, uncertainties are based on markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange taking a street during the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest due to the lack of guarantees alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values both in long and short tranches."
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a more lateral behavior, not free of volatility "mostly because the impact of the likely decline of the Fed types is not known, given the high level of crudeness and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, head of sales of BPI in Spain, coincides with that it's not a good time to venture to say that there's going to be rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the peaks marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Even so, not all experts have this negative vision.
Juan Solana, an analyst from Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer than 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that are produced every year on these dates.
However, the expert softens that things will be somewhat different this year because he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst for Investis Banco, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a bounce of the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst trusts them to be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for bringing the Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says "this year it's up to the great values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electric sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco, assures that the climbs will come from the hand of the bank and the industry.
Manufacturers may also benefit from this rally if they are given.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow their own path," the expert explains.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a low month.
The real year-end rally was lived in 2003, an exercise in which the securities markets came out of the crisis caused by the squeezing of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a 6.68 per cent repeat.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment Ibex has risen by 8.36 per cent since January) and whether it can count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew much of their offices.
A total of 200, located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group to decide to jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to extend the timetables of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the popular experience will be crucial for other entities to focus on this initiative that supports trade schedules.
This is precisely the goal that people pursue with the project.
To capture the private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, autonomouss and trades of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernise the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile that customers present on the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedule is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not involve a major investment, even if a higher recruitment of staff, since it is different from having about six employees per site to eight or nine.
Offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be correct, according to Rivero.
There are currently 2,500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the Mondocredit brand, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these facilities in PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our customers," notes Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telefive first doubles the value in Bolsa by their rival Antena 3
We did it.
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction yesterday, Paolo Vasile, the delegate counselor of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain running duplicated the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Just one aspect of his joy was his: 'it's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown up but because we've gone down less' he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telefive ended yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That gain is your loss in what we've been doing for the year at 15.66%.
The value in Mediaset-controlled company stock exchange (with 52% of the capital) and attended by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antenna 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulates a fall of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in Prisa (Five-Day Editor) and 1,779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we cost it in terms of audiences.'
Telefive announced last week that he planned to become the first television channel this year to exceed the billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
If this data is made real, the television network would record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing over the 2006 financial year of 965.4 million.
For its part, the net billing of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while the net revenues of television grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is soon to make the decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those we have already valued with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows at this time of some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profits estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
The projected income growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same firm has dropped Antena’s expected profit by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary process, which ended today with the Congress's vote on amendments to the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the rules of procedure to be developed by the new law, with the aim that they both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and consent to the best regulation in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of entities for markets to function efficiently.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, implies the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new legislation will provide financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firm (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the implementation of operations on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management on the market and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they perform, to facilitate the monitoring by the NCMV.
A number of amendments were incorporated through the Congressional Economic Commission, including the fact that debt titrated is considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with the debt of high-risk U.S. mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delineate the functions that graduates can develop in economic and business 30 years after the actual decree defining professional functions reserved for economists was passed in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on a foreign basis, will not require the authorization of CNMV and may provide its product marketing and customer capture services to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the definitive data, which will be made known on the next 14 December.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the rise in the IPC 4.1% in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time it has hoped that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
It has also explained that in November there was "less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy regarding the advanced data today.
Virgin plans to collect with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (16,800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, there were record deposits of over £25,000, a figure which has gradually fallen in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its customers and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of that money that the Government offered and which will remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues in British banks deposited in the next three years to achieve those 18 billion pounds remaining until the target of 30. billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its impressive advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their favorite to rescue him from the bankruptcy.
Arrested the mayor of Totana for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested today at the first hour of the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) for its alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption seized this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the Consistorium and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May with Juan Morales, a current popular deputy, and until then director of the municipality, and that according to sources of the research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Officers continue to register municipal units and councillors of Urbanism and no further detention will be ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot seized earlier this week, has been charged.
As the Cedena SER was informed yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' MP Juan Morales, so far away, was stopped leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the research, according to sources of the research, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to recalculate 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in detention.
Bono accepts to lead PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general election and to be President of Congress in case the Socialists win the general election.
This was announced by the Secretary of PSOE Organization, José Blanco, and the Bono himself, after the meeting that he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and "Bono is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "it seems" that the manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made his decision on 15 November to not go to the next general elections and to leave his career in active policy to focus on combating climate change at the university level.
The former minister has recognized that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He has also pointed out that, as citizens know who the vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress in an "transparency act".
If you reach the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry" and to make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak calmly and quietly is the Congress, the president of the government at one time interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good-doing" and he has not already wanted to see his position in order not to fall into what he has pointed out, his adversaries could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subjected to impertinent persecution both the sceptics of their predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And another leader of the movement that is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges you to explain why your Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's leadership of the EU in violation of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors have occurred, and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
It also requires the Spanish people to explain clearly what measures they will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits should be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been nor will there be such explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costs, uncomfortable and threatening for business accounts and individuals.
Even the amount of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that it has hastened to deny it.
That is, that it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With striking sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for the electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor demands nor demands, but he adorns the myths and inspires tenderness.
When it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not mean that we move by bicycle or cool with the fan.
Detained the mayor and head of the local Totana Police for a alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the city's secretary and a hostel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, today have informed sources of the investigation.
The building was arrested at home and has been transferred to the Consistorio, in which the units are currently located with numerous agents, who have also visited the Town Council of Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three arrests are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been made available to the court today.
According to the sources, the former director of Totana and today an autonomic parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, who owns a registered real estate agency today in Totana, has been charged, like the current former director's girlfriend, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the vigues lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as did Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Imonuar, an agency integrated into the above group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, performed eleven records, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were re-qualified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
Nuaria Group joins companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycasse, which manages the lively parking lots of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza de Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent offers us this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way in the head of the PISA report on the educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Filosophy’s signature has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela’s school.
The guilty of the deaths, a bachelor’s degree student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Councillor for Education in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and said that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague reports on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet Discharge Crimes:
A. The discharge of a song would be a crime with six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal from the record store of less than EUR 400, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the duty to discharge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the discharge (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in compact exchange.
Participating in a tumultuous queen has a sentence of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and exchange would be a sentence of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than reducing a film to DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).

My head doctor took me off one of his rare research articles entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings that generate the monthly pay of workers depend on what peers earn.
The study has been carried out using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life &Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if when both received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one received the double, activation was higher.
I don't know if it took so much science this conclusion.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the prosecution of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term of office ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with an agri-dulce taste, because the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim bosnios died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic remain free.
His names are on that list, which takes his title from the documentary of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not stressed in Spain) who, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fled criminals and press the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance is good for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible loss, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the seniority of the car, marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of the vehicle, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in return for it to be liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of injury.
The premium is the insurance price, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the sheep, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or the use of the insurance, among others.
The insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that they are more likely to suffer an accident, a higher amount to pay.
That is why both older women and 25 must pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of sinequality due to their prudence.
In addition, by handing the counts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with this the probability of having some kind of perchance.
As the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver must study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will explain here the most significant variables in choosing one or other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured person, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with a number of inconveniences in hiring a affordable insurance at a price, such as the low driving experience and the seniority of the sheep.
While the ideal to be well secured is a risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose for a whole risk with frankness, so that they obtain insurance coverage at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer pays a portion of the amount of the sinister.
"The part of the amount of loss the customer gives will pre-set according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", says Luis Noguera, the maximum responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so the customer will ensure protection against damage to third parties, even if not to those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid the sinister to the extent possible, since this will have an impact on the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that basic tariff.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year, it will be possible to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After the 25-year band, drivers have made it easier for them to hire insurance, as the rate of sineStrality is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended is to hire a whole risk with frankness.
"Usually young people cannot make use of the experience they have previously acquired when using an accident, and even when driving", says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'novice' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children, it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as their economic situation permits, of course it is.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by the insurers as the public with a lower rate of sinestrality, so the charges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk with frankness (may be 300 euros), or, where a high level of bonus is available, one to thirds extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchise," said Luis Noguera.
In the case of retirees, it is recommended that insurance be offered at all risk without charge (if it is EUR 150), or one is extended to third parties when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver before possible harm, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic searches Milan for a point that is worth the eighths
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they need to achieve their respective goals in closing the 'Champions' ligilla, as Italians serve to be first and the Scots to judge their classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that it receives the Benfica, which has four, does not go ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to fight the World Clubs in Japan, where it starts on the 13th day in semifinals in search of a square for the end of the 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, because the Italians won't want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would stay first and will ensure a better cross in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's set could even serve a defeat to be ranked if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because on equal terms the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter the Scots at night, who trust to get in eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round the last campaign with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the drive.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar to whom only the triumph is worth, in case the Celtic loses, both to get in eighths and to follow in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without any choice to pursue in the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they broke up in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the Vancouver GM Place stadium that the group's meeting is "bright".
About 20,000 people ran out of tickets to attend the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that raged in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went to the stage wearing bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the public who was covering the GM Place, despite the fact that Victoria's nerves had banned him days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "had not seen our dress, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what you're going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 'for the differences between us' caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "the things have been fixed and we love each other a lot."
But many things have changed since Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special flight from Virgin Airlines.
Upon his arrival at the airport, he was expecting an army of nannys.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (5th and 7th December).
Madrid will act on 23 December.
New fears of gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it affects the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute earlier last year reduced supplies to the EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, a monopolistic gas owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine was supposed to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge Ukraine more, as it has pledged to pay 50 per cent extra in 2008 for the gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40 per cent more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," said Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh to the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly rose prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of EU supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is still not fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply in Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "must prove foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees outside Europe, said a vigilante.
The recommendation of Auditor General Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the amount of foreign personnel it counts with.
However, his report noted other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area, following attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after hitting a jeep at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted on the Old Bailey video conference in October, accused of alleged bomb car attacks in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment cheques to candidates, to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background controls, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The report of the Auditor General recommends, inter alia, that the Boards should have the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS personnel."
BMA President Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment cheques could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment cheques work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what is the added value of the recommendations made," he explained.
The Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number can be higher, in part because the joints have problems identifying what are the employees with indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport controls, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide of foreigners in NHS.
The health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, states: "It was of great interest that this work was carried out following the terrorist attack of Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which they had planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates movie awards
Control, the biographical film about the late singer of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
The actress Judi Dench was named better actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were given at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise to the fame of Curtis with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - with soundtrack from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3 thousand pounds sterling.
But also winner was the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic character of the album Joshua Tree U2, awarded with two awards- to better director and best debutant director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning at the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the prize for the best documentary.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his driver role of a head of the Russian mob in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promesas del Este.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently filmes the sequel of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Glass Skull".
Winston said he was proud to receive that prize, named after Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor."
The independent cinema awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The supporters and drivers of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell activists planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the local monarchy, in partnership with the United States, since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 to protect Abqaiq facilities, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed attack by Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "Missile Launch Expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said that the militants had planned the smuggling of eight shells into the country.
22 other detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active to stop Saudis who travel to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda as militants to fight the Allied forces and support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered a heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunis.
Al-Qaeda militants have in their eyes many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - chosen by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-Western government of the country - had as objectives the residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort of the security forces, for five months of work," said the spokesman for the interior minister on state television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 others accused of providing financial support and support to militants.

Venus may once have been a suitable place for life, they declared scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a gem on Earth than previously observed.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford Physics Department and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is clarifying why the climate in Venus is so different from that in the Earth, when there are two planets so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to construct a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police decompose "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesperson stated that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds sterling).
It still remains open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where common voters and currents record video questions and send them to spread among candidates.
None of the questions raised in the afternoon of Wednesday, 28 November, were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the republican YouTube party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party in front of the next year's elections.
It is not exactly known how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to aspirants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest one-item discussion, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to go up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the broadcasters noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest exchanges of words of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his house.
They both responded aggressively when they were asked whether any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regulate their situation and give them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed with the subject.
No one has the word of being nominated as a candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both alerted the subject of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other external concerns, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that, while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in Jonah’s history and the whale.
Another asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first of all in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus would be in favour, he laughed that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increased in Iowa, coincidently with liberal Ron Paul's fund-raising campaigns, and his heated statements of the Wednesday debate.
The two of them have come from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not appear to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor extramarital finger suckers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour Party, over £650,000 ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister chose to call an election, insulting British intelligence stupidly by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, as Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat is leading with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's rescue, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and trial poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative record.
A trio of retired generals began a riot in the chamber of the Lores, protesting against the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a middle-time job.
Now these are David Abrahams' many donations; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but usually suspend their unbelief when a new lot takes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve things, which he does not have much time, that suspension is too much: public officials are beginning to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is putting itself to the defensive and does not focus.
In one part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although I wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
Northern Rock's problems and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions that Brown made as a hero's Chancellor.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blairish's countertimes - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died or been cheated directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compared his donations with gifts of charity, said that he did not want public recognition for his kindness.
This may be the case, but the decision doesn't make it.
The laws against anonymity for major political taxpayers are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he had heard of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that he was not illegal, would obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising, to whom he was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not so far involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these proceedings, although the bulk of the payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the job.
It has been quick to condemn your party for violating the law, but it is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a committee of inquiry on the matter - conducted to a large extent by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent leader for the Public Life Standards Commission, since he has not had one for six months, and must also press for a genuine reform of the funding of the parties.
This will require a hard cooperative work by the Labour Party with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the trade unions - bitter measures for a partisan such as Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks cards
The crisis of subprime mortgages is infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal fins swim excited around.
Today, the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes placed on the country market of credit cards.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis subprimes contaminates other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are coming.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or have more than 30 days' delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million in its financing business to the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of the card lenders.
However, it is very early for panic.
Moroity and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third trimester of crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of persons (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of moroity) would be growing again, or may happen that the conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emissions volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are running out.
But the issuers of the credit card look more at the flow of liquidity than the asset values, so that falling prices do not necessarily make a change in the creditor capacity of the lenders.
They can even work to help the broadcasters.
The incentives for consumers to continue to cushion the mortgage decreases if the properties are less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the debt of the card goes up on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders may have, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid retaliation of assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Head of Finance of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit contraction push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more severe future.
Those dorsal fins must continue to be monitored.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who tried their responsibility for fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to be enriched by employees.
They were brought to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each was convicted as guilty of fraud collision.
The three former Greenwich Natwest executives, a unit of the Scottish PLC group in the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, your case marks the end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against bankers were that they had been alerted in 2002 to Fastow that it was the objective of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The charge against bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a company in Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, who helped their spiral crash in bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three Britons knew that it would value in height.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its subsidiary parts.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received approximately 12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the collapse of Enron.
Three British men were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a 3 year and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their businesses that fail appear successful.
The collapse resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs, over 60 million in market values and over two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling were held hostage last year for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of over 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, begins at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"Has capacity up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day-consuming orgy held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract the new wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from crafted jets in chaos to the grids of incrusted diamonds, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at the nearby stand of hiss."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and calderilla compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplied with fuel by the rise of oil, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when he was in a state of peak.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, Senior Professor at Davis Center for the Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their share of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, this week a conference will be held on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think-tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the level of subsistence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow--and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, David Morris' sales and marketing representative, London Jewel.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccablely prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the Sunday evening fair, dressed in afternoon costume, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"Look at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeled off the design costume that he used as a network carpet veteran disshing with Joan Rivers.
The aim of the fair is to attract the new wealthy, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay in a warehouse that mix brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cutters, Mövenpick ice creams, pool tables to charge, apartments in Dubai and Teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44,57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of the Dutch real porcelain Delft, in front of a reconstruction wall size of a painting by Rembrandt, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said that Russians rich in the most trajectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the striking logos to the trademarks of limited editions, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director general of King Koil's beds, said he sold two mattress systems of $70,000 each, made of silk, cachemira and cotton mixed with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold brilliant orange Porsche, for $170.000 to a Russian millionaire.
In the afternoon of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said that he had sold three car grilles in the form of chain bracelet, for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with incrusted rays of Swarovski-colour crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants poultry leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, does not necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karaptian.
"He'll keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the price wave of real estate properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionaire, at least in paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There's more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone cabins (British style) filled with stacks of counterfeit bills of one million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking money batteries, asking their friends to take photos with their mobiles while resting on piles of money, or borrowing a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev says.
Headache surgery could be the cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance went up White Cape Cod, two doors below on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a car came from the police patrol.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance rise," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that day on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Newark police department manager.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died from an unauthorized plastic surgeon who is not yet identified by the police, but who works in the 212 West Scott.
The authorities do not yet determine what caused the death of Mrs. Arroyo, but wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available for a few weeks. It will help resolve the mysterious death that is hanging on the upper ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, working and tenaz," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcoholic Drink Control Commission, leaving two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepmother.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the County Union Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died from unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they came home about 3 P.M.
On November 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead in the place.
It's been over a week and the authorities have said little about your research or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered to the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a marchito rose is located in the front of the house, and a Dalmata bark in the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainylline ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - was at the door of the garage, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to the side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
"She would say, "you have to watch with this or that," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when not.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the Stock Exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm down credit conditions with cut interest rates, which increased with the reassuring comments of the vice-president of the U.S. central bank.
The stock exchanges were loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, Ben Bernanke, President of the Reserve, declared that policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in response to the continuing strain on financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets in the midst of growing credit exchanges samples, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "partly reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October".
If the upward trend continued, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
Comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
Observations also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice of Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in an overall cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in the US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55 per cent, to 13.289.40, while the large index S&P 500 rose by 2.65 per cent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to the closure of 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to Britain's first-order companies.
The Dax index in Germany rose by 2.6%, and CAC40 in France was above 2.3%.
First, there was a resurgence of market credit tension after a strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks by 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained the credit and three-month loan rates "Libor" between the British banks, meant the higher rise since September, by 6.59%, after a steady rise from 12 November.
England judges the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as hard as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan—with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moore, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the office of Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill up with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth place of bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket is the choice difficult, as trials are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time taking a "wicket" and a beater to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have impact as a player someday.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison is declared for "fit and bowls" as the wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of them.
The Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played each test and did well in the first five jackpots and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a major player, and despite noting a double hundred against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today's Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and will favor Shah's greatest experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both of them.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first class in front of only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent precedents against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten races in his two shifts in May against West Indias on the test in Lords, his house as a Midlessex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, he seemed to have taken from his "batting" something of propeller that in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team has the joy of living on swords.
He's stuck for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he flew his vehicle into an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to say with excitement: "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, it's including his slender pass to have effects on his games that seem to satisfy him, as it beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who were left with no cash, no visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I've read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and it's safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he states, referring to the Shiite militia of the religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary cessation.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis to work in its country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an ally U.S. force helped to get Al-Qaeda out of his bastion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals of Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh to northern Baghdad, by a grenade attack, after urging citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues."
"That's why I came back today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Oeidi.
Many have said they have been attracted by increasing calm in the capital since U.S. troops were building groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with U.S. military to defend their neighbours.
But many have declared that they have returned because of the refusal of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have been established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled the country because of the sectarian gangs of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting Iraqi visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and begin the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only an educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftyth time to a non-Serlander who we are not French" - that was the ironic motorcycle about themselves of the smallest federal state for his fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a major role in the educational system of the Sarre which, in a study by the Institute of the German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor", took the fifth place.
In this way, higher schools by tradition have good relationships with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from the Sarre is higher than average in higher schools, many of them do not have a baccalaureate.
"In the Sarre, the vocational education system is being used," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the Instituto de la Economía Germana (IW).
More than five young people make their bachelor’s degree at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for vocational and academic education is very broad.
The offer of dual careers, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education in Sarre forced higher schools to make more publicity for engineering specialties.
"After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
For children to start studying as soon as possible the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model imitates the other federal states as well.
Comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of late school-development students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But in general, the Sarre didn't improve much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages to the detriment of the Sardinians, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject at the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chávez changes the time.
Nearly in Venezuela there will be another different time zone to the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez has changed his schedule in the South American country by delaying the half-hour clock.
Currently Chávez is staying as a comic in Spain.
As reported in the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will be less than four hours GMT.
Thus, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision to say that the United States imposed on the world in its day the obligation by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighbouring country Colombia due to action with hostage taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not have any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until Conservative Álvaro Uribe continued to be President of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is proposing a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe by withdrawing Chávez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it concerned the liberation of hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that the decision that Uribe made has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chávez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continued interruptions by leftist populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees are expected to have a lower real salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The blame for that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the stretching of food and energy prices," said the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomic Institute and Research of Economic Cycles.
The new unemployment insurance charges may also be for employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention of reducing the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent over one year, is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office of work does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and grants to the Federal State, in accordance with the words of a German Social Democratic Party politician.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the rate of inflation with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3 %.
Venus: Twin brother from Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most like the Earth, something that had not been raised until now. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and raisins in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on Earth.
For the past three decades, researchers had suspected that there could be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays are silent at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, had originated the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it's not like this: if I ever had life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and on the surface there are temperatures of 500°C, oscillating in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Perhaps Venus is a "diabolic" gem on Earth, but it's still a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus Express" is to answer the question why Venus, so much like the Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
As since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step in the investigation of Venus.
The latest results of the research to be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to researchers' opinion, not only emphasize Venus' uniqueness in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with the Earth than we had assumed," says ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon reminds of wind flows in the high earth's atmospheric layers of poles, according to a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost so large.
This planet also called the dawn star or the evening star orbits around the Sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not much like the Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed in the same conditions.
On the two planets water had been aggregated that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it was disounded in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellorry.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition finish this fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler said to the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding with regard to the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have a great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely in force for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, the Federal President points out, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of Una China's policy.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democrat Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Foreign Office caused great misunderstanding in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democrat Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to sources of information from the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of Chinese government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Ángela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama demonstrated that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that riots like those in France will occur.
Battles with the police on the streets, shots, car burns: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots, as was the case with France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from moving to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious disturbances by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Union Party) feared similar trends in Germany.
"We need to look at TAMBIÉN that our country's social problems do not take the violent form."
"That we have to take it seriously," said the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hanover.
Not all young people are developing in the constant change in social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis on solving these problems, Schaeuble said.
That is not only about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits."
It's still early to sit the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as is the case in France.
The young people played a major role in the streets with the police in the north of Paris last night.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above the average.
There must be more vocational training posts.
Kolat points out: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", more than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
"The opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training more quickly needs to be given."
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with headlamps overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1000 police officers has been on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
On Monday night around 80 cops were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued the next night in Toulouse.
The riot started with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor ' s office, the death of young people was not due to the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The performance far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition on content reached its last point and that there is nothing more to be expected of it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate action, indifferent and contentless in the general debate of the Lower House it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be ruled by her.
As to the reproach he was given for having repeatedly devoted himself to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptive sentence.
He said that this would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he did not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House it was very clearly stated to all that that reproach was appropriate.
There could be no minimal interest, no sense of feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Ángela Wolke came forward in this way: a very high policy that flees to foreign policy and remains there without any concrete achievement.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it was very self-declared for the decisions made in Heiligendammm, but it says nothing about how these goals should be achieved here on climate issues.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, he's engaged in expressions so he can get a boost on people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the inner problems are low-value appearances.
The poverty of children and the concern of low-paid workers?
All he's dedicated to is talking about this subject using subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong to speak when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to make a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favourites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a heated debate of Republican presidential precadents from YouTube and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between candidates are already noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney criticized his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
He, for his part, responded with grave reproach: "I would like to say that his own house was a "door" for illegals." Giuliani answered the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who used illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans has no clear favorite, the eight presidential precadents take advantage of the debate at the CNN, especially in order to discredit their opponents.
The small videos of 30 seconds, shot by internet users that were sent to Youtube, do not have much content either.
"With this method of isolation we let Hitler come to power," that was John McCain's reproach on his opponent Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing the troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding ", a method of interrogation, by allowing a person to drown, to simulate his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important themes of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised the conservative values and denied the rise of taxes.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney, who apologized to the people and the television audience for being a advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what she thought about the Bible’s literal interpretation.
Musharraf rules for the first time without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president took an oath as president.
That's how the eight years of military rule end in Pakistan.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second term of 5 years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his army chief mandate to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he was made with power with an incrucible military coup, the former general ruled for the first time the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and of the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state Attorney General, after the Musharraf oath, will soon reverse the state of emergency and will meet the second condition of the west.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency at the Supreme Court there were many lawyers who supported Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all remedies before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
In the meantime, in an attack on a convoy of the military in the North Watt region, five soldiers died and four others were injured.
According to information from the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the Afghanistan border.
The founders of Krautrock return.
The most famous German band in the 1970s follows their activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a restreno was made a copy of "Live 1974" that was written at the best time of the band.
Already in those times they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the feeling.
Each one of them has before him his box, his cables and especially his buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with his sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's enthusiasts was the fact that the Harmonia band would make music again.
What we need to rebel here is the following: the questions accurately showed that the name of the band was clouding people's minds, but it was not as special as it was for the public to miss it so much after 32 years.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the Krautrock misconception was always more valued in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music prize to the members of the band Can 2003 from Cologne for their life work, in the room they could see the surprise faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band The Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouth with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio existed only two years and in those times it does not have a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Rodeelius had played music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in Berliner Schaubuehne's basement.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Dueseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Roth had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the Neu band! He improved the fame of this German band that at those times was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruins of the 16th century, lived as refugees in the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
As they say, one day an association banner of song Harmony of Ottenstein appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmony" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone recalls that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do some rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on issues of esotericism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster relived the 1980s and has since had more success than he had Harmony.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that must be thanking Groenemeyer.
Your Grenland music company set itself as a goal to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Snow! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place at the World Cultures House in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony took the position of a superband, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's sentence accompanied by the special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in black and white photo projections, where instruments with cables are seen.
At the bottom there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and the battery in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
At present electronic music is just like it had to be.
Three people who deepen in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical setting it is coughed, sweated and in a good moment of emphasis it is sung "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
It was not the origin of gender in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" he's right, too, but now Harmony keeps calm.
The scenario reflects very well on what is already obvious.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
That can break one's nerves or give you quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to war in the Balkans.
But they both didn't have much conviction.
Or the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can not help in this case either.
At the beginning there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the mountain of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the war of Bosnia, was discovered again actor Richard Gere.
Finally, we had lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why today the movie titles have to be so long and shot?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the sight: in the background, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destiny and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life had already passed, than as a monument of the ruin of his decadence had so far preserved most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, it turns out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about war in the Balkans.
You can narrate the film "Moerderischer Frieden" in a few words: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast, and that also leads to her falling in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented again as the only guilty ones.
The film is like the German series "Alarm be Cobra 11" without highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good movie about war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another script author (Richhard Shepard in two positions), the story about the American reporters in the war who went to detect a war criminal Serb called "Zorro", it could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go to the mountain twice to carry out something that the army cannot do and every time it turns out to be a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they introduce us to Simon Hunt, to him who they don't just let him be a cynic with hearts.
No, the script also provides for a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will then kill.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters, who went to capture the war criminal and leave them to the Muslim Bosnians in a fair way.
It is so bad that they want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, one deeply human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and points out that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem consists not only of the gender of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star goes through a region of crisis or the mining fields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Diaminantes sanguinantes" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to go through at least decades until Hollywood prays for a good film about the holocaust, with the example of the film "The Schindler List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not celebrated unanimously as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because script authors don't have the least repair (which is necessary for power) in telling good stories.
"Being or not" or "The great dictator" turned out to be so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know that the Nazi regime was in fact so bad.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you must be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic, distant look from an artist.
When asked him about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's just because some things never change."
Large cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympics as a response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms from politics and the economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust reminds us that we have to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, stated on Wednesday this resignation as "not good for the economic location".
In the last time no other project in the great city encouraged as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, political momentum could not be maintained, sporting at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Summer Olympics did not take place until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but decides on the request by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
It referred to the decision of the Sportbund Federation, which is expected in early December, on Munich's request for the Winter Olympics of 2028.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, we so far thought we had up to 2028, from a realistic point of view, we will have no opportunity."
Despite everything, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity go, if at this time the plans are ruined," said Günter Ploß, HSB's director on Wednesday.
A waiver of the request is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Sports Federation in the upper schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's request for universities in 2015 not as "a substitute" for the Olympics in Hamburg.
Only last week the sports Federation of higher schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Fraction of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) challenged the Senate that it did not take such valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small district of Grassbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the members of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required an integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the 2012 Summer Olympics gave rise to great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-Box "type" on this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" put the doubt about the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxes, Andy Warhol, the Modern Museum Museum in Stockholm carried out internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultten museum gave to the Modern Museum, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of "the Stockholm type", which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the boxes of red, blue and white wood, with the same sample that had soap powder cards "Brillo".
According to Warhol, at the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Museum of Modern Museum were exposed hundreds of Brillo-boxes of cardboard. These did not make them Warhol (because of expenses), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a brio-box of wood, but were not exposed at the Museum Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now talk about that almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of the "Stocolmo type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultten Museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes Warhol left to him.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died three years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Modern Museum, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968. First they printed and trimmed their silvers pressed and then painted them oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the year 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the silvers pressed. Furthermore, it is not the oil painting, but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo-Boxes," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museum Museum Museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exposure objects".
Already in Julio The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "severe accusations" in which it refers to boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment on, everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender to Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers had surrendered to a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Head Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
The government soldiers had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been chaining for a few hours in the building.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had the trial on Thursday for having tried a coup in 2003 that ended with a failure.
It took advantage of the negotiations, so that it could suddenly be deposited with about 30 supporters.
The military police who had to monitor him had evidently gone to their ranks and followed their motto.
They entered the hotel "Península" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent session of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Counsellor, condemned the behaviour of the soldiers.
"People are tired," Trillanes said.
"We invite people to come to our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite team Scouts, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The great critics of government called on Thursday for a great demonstration against the president.
For months your government has been reproaching for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention of the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts by the Philippines against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel's biggest shareholder.
United Internet has ensured more than 20 percent of Versatel’s telecommunications company’s actions.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for an action is 14, 46 euros.
You have only 20.05 percent of the social capital.
There were many speculations about the absorption of the company.
There are also options for increasing the financial share in Versailles.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to speed up the consolidation of the German DSL market (digital subscription line).
On Wednesday, the assumptions about entry into business were made, after the Brendenberg bank increased its participation in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, that means that the financial institution maintains the participation securities for a third-party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day made nearly 10 percent of the Dillisch telecommunications company participate.
Drillisch to the extent of capital expansion placed 17.4 million of new actions worth € 106.4 million.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares from them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies started negotiations on DSL-products marketing cooperation.
"We strengthen our collaboration," explained the spokesman for United Internet.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire the Freenet competitor.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the 10 percent stake in Freenet and do not use their right, that is, they make participation at 18.49 percent of Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially participation in the anonymous Freenet society.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the holding of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of Freenet participation.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
