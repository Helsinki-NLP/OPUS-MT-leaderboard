What is it? The ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the pastry
The new ČSSD councils in the capital are going to have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers for the members of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed colleagues in the ODS.
The Aksuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new Council of ČSSD to check their knowledge of the language marked slang that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's flower and political nata during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors almost do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
"I'm rather a novice in Prague politics," said the Culture Councillor Lukaš Kaucký during the terminology examination of "colegueo".
And with regard to the political veteran, Karel Březina reacted equally.
Maybe they know the concept of "golf-hoyo."
"Maybe it's the only expression of all you asked me to use from time to time."
"If not, usually in the slang job."
Of the glossary, whose definitions published in the newspaper Aksuálně.cz last June before the ODS polling congress, the writing selected six examples, in particular those that are particularly related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
Socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "greater Prague golf course", "go to the bakery", "the bull's nest", "the treason of the capital" and "blander".
Three council members agreed to take the test and one fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolinek, refused to do so directly.
"I don't get into these things, and I don't think I'm going to appreciate how the democratic civics have a good time."
"What I really care about is how we will understand ourselves in the execution of our programmes," he said.
As has been seen, Councillor Lukaš Kaucký was allegedly unaware that the earlier title is an expression about an influential employer and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not say anything to him; the only term that was correct in the exam is "the largest golf course in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I know about the news."
"I'm going to have to aim at a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf course the Blanka tunnel, but also the Councillor of Environment Lukeš Plachý.
Later, both socio-democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukaš Plachý even knows where to find that character; moreover, they suspect the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon it is revealed to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge has gained them from the news, but does not use such a vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-democrats there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really seems we don't have anything like it."
"Well, between us we use apode, sometimes abbreviations or we make word games with names," says the president of ČSSD, Petr Hulinský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
"At school I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that too," he confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aksuálně.cz tested the name and worked.
For his party colleagues, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), representative Miroslav Poche, with whom he was associated before the election of deceptions during the party's sponsorship, receives the award of "Igraček" ("playmobil") by some of his companions.
The apothecary are also the only expressions that socio-democratics tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulinský does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aksuálně.cz has also discovered other apodos for this pragênse president.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Mothers" apparently recalls that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "worsts", as published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an advanced age, they can't work, for example, for health reasons, they're single and they don't have children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the town.
"Men rarely suffer like that."
"It also does not isolate healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso is occupied in a special residence of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a stick.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," warns Die Standard on the disadvantages of written awareness.
The accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighboring country in Burkina Faso, last week Ammy Hemmah died, 72 years old, when three women and two men tortured her, they filled her with gasoline and burned her.
The news came on the BBC.
The authors state that it was due to a miserable cluster of circumstances.
According to its version, the woman was taken into the oil used for ritual anointings.
He was caught in flames when the group wanted to "exhale the bad spirits" from the woman.
Isolation of the "brides" supports people at all educational levels.
Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The devourers of human souls always posed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is trying to pacify the witch hunt, last year in Gambia the president still participated in it.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a broad hunt for witches who had allegedly been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help him bring shamans from nearby Guinea that, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, led to force men and women randomly chosen among the Gambian peoples to the President's property in Kanilai," noted the organization Amnesty International in his report.
At the farm, arrested people had to drink a pot of herbs with hallucinogen effects that also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people who had been arrested.
The Bakala tenant: warm with coal stoves and sign a higher rent
The man, aged and retiring, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of the "carbon magnet" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rentals in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried some documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his daughter's, and his son's, who is serving sentence.
The three of them have just caught the liberalisation of the rentals.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-room floor with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, there is no hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler", he shows with his finger the man in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry, half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Civil Association, which qualified the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends tenants who do not sign the new contracts and who wait until 7 December, the date on which it will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, before this, the man only makes a magnet.
"Anything says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large testing laboratory for liberalisation.
After New Year it will occur with the great majority of the apartments that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated lease.
That is why Aksuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG miner waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to you is a number pickup machine.
"To rent 2011", you can read in a light button of your touch screen.
When you pulsate it, a paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost doesn't give time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Shortly thereafter, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the tenants bozones of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the cards an increase in the rental of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window is opened at the customer service centre for the new rentals.
"It's been running for a week, so it's starting," the workers who are present in it, after having hesitated briefly, respond when the customer presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old floors for Bakala miners are the most delicate themes in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from ČSSD, had already dealt with them and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Fifty years later I want a new floor."
"I didn't even change the damn toilet dish," the man mentioned in the introduction was unburdened.
According to the workers, for the moment they come more than anything retired to check whether they receive a discount in the rental if they sign in time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
They shall also receive half of the rent discount in February of the remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" is certainly not able to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked for the rental in 2011 about forty-fifty people," says the employee of the window.
In the meantime, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts where necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on rental, the matter shall be settled by an independent judge.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed and completely in accordance with the law," warns RPG on its pages.
"Here no one will be judged," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him at least in part the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to the courts," she says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek informs you in the ways that they do not sign, so maybe people wait," he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rentals do not even cover the necessary amounts for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the company's residential portfolio RPG Byty, who adds that the neglected state of the community's fund that angers the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the rental.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments 4 billion, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.200 million.
The large screen that hangs from the roof, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of GDP properties."
"In addition, it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per square metre", it is indicated on the screen.
Only 38% increase the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low quantities of 19.66 crowns per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged the next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not affect rents at all, but will be scaled from four to eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the rental raise money (see graph) again on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Those who sign the lease agreement will have priority.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides in his interior a small nursery with everything itself at such facilities: colour walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of Arch.Design can come to her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, whose study came out of numerous known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guardy.
About 90 people work in the company, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Designs to his workers in the framework of his social programme.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with child care.
The mini-guard was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guard is financed through the European Social Fund within the framework of the operational programme on human resources and employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a provision of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mini-guardy running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the application for funding contributed to the Economy Rating.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The day-to-day day care centre currently welcomes children without age limit, although most of them are under three years of age.
Since it is a mini-guardian, it can only simultaneously accommodate a maximum of five children, even though with shifts more during the day.
The operation of the daycare facility is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the daycare centre, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
While it is an individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-guardian programme are comparable to the usual pre-school education programme.
In it, children not only play, but also receive a quality education: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach up to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their place of work.
Thus, parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is one of the sign companies that offers a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced the marketing of staff.
The bone house continues fascinating after 100 years. Watch Gaudí’s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remember the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the premises called it "the house of the bones."
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the innovative use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that recalls the scales and the omnipresent gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with unique lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, one sees a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thoughted order.
At night, the whole façade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illuminated so that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the twist of the forms continues to surprise us also inside it.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the balconies, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signs.
La Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district in number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, emerged from the remodeling of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on bringing down the previous building and starting from zero, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the House Batlló, made up of several apartments, did not design it by Antoni Gaudí alone.
In the design he collaborated with the architect Josep María Jujol.
In fact, in their plans of the project there were ornaments for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
In the façade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Park Güell de Gaudí, in which other parts of it are found.
Due to its organic form, the premises shortly after their completion called it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of the woods."
It is also said that, at the height of the construction, the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious reasons.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation ventilators and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange its inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not at all respect the building rules of the moment and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although clearly the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so impressed with the result it requested to be corrected.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public steel.
The arrangements were never done, rather, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the town council application, Josep Batlló requested (and got) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself was installed on the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented into a jewelry store.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the right angles and lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the salons and a larger group can thus communicate without any problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and slots.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light on all the floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that the white reflects more light than the dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb the rays of the sun.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and to the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí buildings into the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with your lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some residents of the neighboring houses and visit you at home.
How the mattress and the somier are chosen: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pumpy bed frame; what really confers its quality on a good bed is the surface to fall down, that is, the mattress and the somier.
First of all, they must be complementary to perfection in order to adapt to specific users.
Many elements, including weight, height, health status and owner's sex, come into play during the election.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the somier are placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them more frequently.
If the central canals are not properly aired and, above all, they are on a firm basis, keep in moisture. It can even appear wet below.
When choosing a bed, they also influence customs.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have problems to feel well on a lower and tougher surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they weren't sleeping as well here."
"For their macheted shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft coat of viscoelastics."
"This type of mattresses is also recommended for people with diabetes who have time problems of the nervous system, so they get bad information about the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadangcziková, who specializes in the covered furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have been spending time preferring viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there's no problem, because they have these right Tempur and the Magniflex Italians, but also the Czech Tropico brand."
You don't have to be a NHL player anymore to appreciate viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes your rigidity and forms depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn around as after a hard match.
Just sleep better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against lakes.
By choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, i.e., between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room of 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple norm can be applied to calculate the width: when lying face up, you should have your hands comfortably shuffled towards the elbows," recommends engineer Helena Prokoková, expert from Cechu čalouník, who has been working on the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a topic that teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each one needs his own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, you will need to mount the dreams at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with mesh interiors a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three cm are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and smoothness.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you sit on the mattress, you should certainly not notice the springs," warns Helena Prokoková.
Each mattress requires a certain type of somier.
The fully housed bedrooms, where the mattress and the base are like siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your bottom, which is often done today.
And since each night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will start to remind us of a large (and congested) samiz.
For this reason, experts reject slogans that speak of a bed life of up to 25 years or even a life guarantee.
However, everything has a hand.
Therefore, sellers give advice: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the bottom, but better add a mattress protector that can easily be removed and washed.
Although mattresses with zipper closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when opening them they are in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their manipulation in the larger models (and for one person) when raising the mattress may seem a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In the bed, instead of a somier, do you have a firm table?
Never!
How much for the beds designed for one night's visit.
However, it should make (if you don't already have) ventilating holes in the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulated sheets containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses may be used (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber), although it is always better a soyer with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the lumbar-zone sheets are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Articulated foils should not be used with a spring mattress, since they do not react to reclination.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the blades, shoulder protection may also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets so that "round" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very broad shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by the mattress manufacturers who, in the "male", began to use a softer area just around their shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are dreams with cross structure or tablets with the so-called multitortion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
It should also take into account that, even if you use the appropriate mattress and somier, if you use a bad pillow (large and "wet"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of them can relax.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
On the side cover, the pillow must be at the same level (when combined with the somier with reinforcement for shoulders or the softer area of the mattress) than the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which the polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils such as rice or soy.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biologically, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the bedbed, one of the first real aloe.
But you can also choose the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to the forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "refreshed" with vegetable extracts of breeze, so that the bottom of the mattress absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the bottom.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel warmer.
The favorite currently?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, making them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam stiffness allows you to make mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where your head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you from seven thousand crowns to the top.
Those performing a therapeutic function often have lower VAT, since they are considered to be health care.
The first one that gained this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and dreams.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the background for 11,990 crowns.
The second is achieved free of charge.
The age of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it appeared as material for NASA, because during the takeoffs astronaut loas they were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempor softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, has a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
It is therefore ideal to prevent lakes from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
Fear for children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a cell box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people feared the case of the missing Anička and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that it is not about spying, but about another means of reducing the potential for tragedy," considers Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that in certain cases such devices can be abused, for example if they get in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," said Pilin.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "cajita" is for and how it is used in case of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to take it, he will simply throw it away.
"Even younger children show great creativity when intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid control of them."
"Before that, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," Bočková says.
In his view, it is questionable whether in the event of an attack such a device is really useful.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will practically always check whether the child carries some type of electronic device that may reveal its location."
"Now's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is extended, it will also look for them, as their sale will certainly be made with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack of a pedophil.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which provides follow-up services for both vehicles and individuals, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence can be helpful.
"The device can be configured to regularly send the position after a given period."
"If you suffer damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices carry an tilt meter, so if the person simply turns over and remains motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigational navigation, where only special software must be installed.
The problem with the current tracking units is that at the moment they are dealing with devices with a size similar to a cell box or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that appear to be a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or that I identify you after some time, which can make the police take time," he adds.
Although tracking devices are carried in the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is a position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough stakes to surround all Chechia. But it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to catch explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added to its arsenal 224 kilometres of mecha.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the mecha is two years, four at the top.
The army bought the explosives match to the STV Group, a. s. 40 million crowns.
General staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometres of mecha per year.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnics of the army, with which MF DNES was contacted, it is decided that, in such a case, such maneuvers should be performed with frequent use of explosives each year, also all generals, senior officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want any exemption from the defence minister Alexandr Vondr and the military captain Vladimir Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend 60 kilometres of mecha.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional reaches a maximum of two meters of mecha, the army would have with the new purchase (including adding the consumption of the units of engineers or specialists) sufficient stocks for the 225 above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained in person recently to Minister Vondra because they say they only have ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices for money are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I can't even understand that I often buy such quantities of mecha."
"But it's your decision and you'll no doubt know why they act that way."
"For us, the army is a good client to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," STV Group's commercial director Jan Děcký admits.
The spokesperson of the Jan Pejšek Ministry of Defence defends hundreds of miles of mecha also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" at least for ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group indicates that the mecha only has a life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, because of the military's possible criticism, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that when buying 445 kilometers of mecha, he got a discount.
"We cost 60% less than last year's 244-kilometre order," says spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence shopping centre.
Just to compare: the annual mecha consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the World War II ammunition or leave it by the Soviet army, has not been more than 1,500 metres for years.
In addition, the police always demand only the fair amount to exhaust the ammunition before their useful life ends.
They decided it for security reasons for the pyrotechnics and, moreover, while more modern and reliable molds can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in completing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition of the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czech army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current one: hundreds of miles of old mecha will have to be eliminated, which is now being bought "shit".
So far I still live from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Employee of the Year" competition helped Lukaš Pytloun to sell the franchises of his hotel.
In the last edition, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukaš Pytloun of Liberec won the "Empreneur of the Year" competition.
His story of success seems to be drawn from a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings I gathered with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit bought a house that was half collapsed composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"Today, the price-quality relationship of the accommodation in our area has moved me to do something about it," says Lukaš Pytloun.
He started renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income I had gained from re-investment in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open four guesthouses in Liberec, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisse, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and others are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said entrepreneur number one last year.
"To this sale of licences for opening hotels helped greatly win the 'Empreneur of the Year' competition," added Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It certainly recommends that everyone try a company that participates in the competition.
But he does not consider it necessary to win, but participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he still lives from the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have begun to collaborate regularly."
The reputation associated with success, in his view, also included in employees,
Totally around seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It's not much less my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"It's only my name that appears in the foreground," says Luke, today modestly Pytloun.
To my successor I wish a year more quiet than we've had in Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated from the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have been past the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Ž.árský, received the first prize in the last edition of Vodafone's competition "Emprechain of the year", last year in the "Slave House" of Prague.
The jury valued its efforts, with which it managed to convert a small technical workshop into Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions of business.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight competition," said last year's winner.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to the father of Karel Ž. Ž.árský the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, it did not hesitate; it gave up its position in the company where she worked and, with a couple of companions, founded the company with its father of plastic stacks.
Shortly thereafter, they started to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest automatic press manufacturer in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialised public after achieving success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers begin to consider the Farmet brand as considerably better, but foreign partners also began to value the collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country," says Karel Ž ŽŽárský.
Last year it may not have been in Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
It also received recognition for commercial results until 2008 and partially from 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and to begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, are also free from such a situation."
"The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs," says Karel Ž. Ž árský.
A viable company must, at times, take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, although at lower levels than before the crisis.
However, where Farmet did not cut costs was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, we have reinforced the presence in the international market and we have obtained magnificent valuations at national fairs," says Žěárský.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and with them the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring about a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Ž.
A survey that reveals ridiculous standards
The Absurdez survey of the year is a fourth-time part of the business tournament.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring documents to the administration to which officials can access online.
The decision adopted more than a third of almost four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration asked for an extract from the commercial register, although its staff can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer request an extract from the trade register when it carries out a control over the taxes of the insured," stated ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the Absurdez survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that should be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in Chechnya and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year is a fourth-time part of the corporate tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and begins to create passion among the general public as well.
While last year's edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year reached almost four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several remaining legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of papers required for the tax declaration we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a stated objective of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Chechia is in position 74a, i.e. eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdez contest of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.sfirmaroku.cz. The contest organizer then selects seven candidates for the "anti-primary" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.sfirmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Wins the absurdity that gets more votes.
For this year's survey more than one hundred, in particular 105 rules and regulations that are meaningless.
The examples were sent by entrepreneurs as well as professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest were, for example, the requirement that vehicles for road and highway maintenance pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals for this year is published on the page of the invitation to tender.
The contest announcement, which is always held early in November in the Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which people from the political and social world often participate.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the contest Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continually disturbs employers, so my goal is to eliminate a minimum of thirty paragraphs every year that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in rubber water.
In 2007, what was most disturbing to people was the employer's obligation to communicate in a three-day advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was abolished in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the office by its foreign workers from work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third one's going to beat her.
The 2009 Absurd was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two soil scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to dispose of a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called Company responsible for the year 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way, we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their environmental activity and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel competition of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Company's main competition in 2010 companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between each other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example the disabled, in other cases the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the 14 finalists from across the Republic, for example, the commercial software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who later participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor of funds to sponsor children with disabilities for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a station that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70 per cent of the staff; therefore, it received the title of company responsible for the central area of Chechia and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the MiRyz Soft accounting company, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also given because it buys Czech manufacturers in priority, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible for our production and administration activities to produce the lowest possible impact on the environment," says entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit of the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and at its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Person's scholarship in trouble, which helps in particular the local Roma community," says the company representative Ondřej Suchý.
The Praní laundry company in čištění in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that affect their pension funds, is also well mentioned.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of the construction company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of company responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company contest were automatically appointed for the year which responded to the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
The organizers removed from the evaluation the forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition for the year, but are not disqualified from the "principal" Vodafone Company competition for the year."
"Individual applications for this contest are not allowed, since this is a subcategory of the main Business contest of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consulting.
Police arrested during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police carried out several arrests in the agricultural fund building over the past few days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land receives it by a precise interested person.
I had to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public auction," Právo told the chief of the Attorney General of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment he cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
The way it could influence the public auction, given the limited official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Lubomíra Agricultural Fund Černá answered Právo's questions by saying that the police actually arrested him at Pilsen headquarters and was during a public auction.
"It's a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocation for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the land law" and takes place when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a value greater than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and the Agricultural Fund then transfers the land to the person offering the highest bid" explained the spokesman of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information on who was to be submitted to the call and, given that he was both interested in acquiring a number of refund rights, he proposed to those interested in the field that would not participate in the auction.
For this reason, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on top.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund some planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly in the place where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Later, he changed them in a very beneficial way with the judge for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the municipality had to intervene because otherwise blocked land would prevent construction.
Families must pay additional costs of several hundred crowns per month
Homes will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating accessories and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to take several hundred crowns out of the portfolio from January onwards, more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas by about 2%, in some cities will have to pay up to 10% more for the supply of water, and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise of electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns more a year than now.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices due to increased support for the production of renewable energy sources, particularly photovoltaics.
However, gas is moderately increasing, especially at the time when heating is most used and, therefore, consumption is greater.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are high all over the country, the price change in central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the houses of Pardubice or Hradec Kralové will pay for the central heating from January about 50 crowns more a month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns a year.
Residents in Prague should also bear an increase of 9% in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructures.
If the rental does not vary, the pests will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rent prices of 450,000 floors rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which owns Ústí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase the rental from January to 100%.
The company will bring the courts to those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of about 300,000 floors, could increase the next year up to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer so, because it does effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are drinks that cause young drinkers to end up in medical care at a age of less than 15 years.
Children who end up in the hospital continually to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is based on the experience of doctors with such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Bever beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get them drunk."
"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages," says Právo, the pediatrician head of Hořvice Hospital in the center of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikan.
"When they get a bottle to their father from the alacena, it can be whisky, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of it being smooth with juice and not smelling so much," he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesman of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"Those are modern alcoholic beverages, especially among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use waiting that they took at home," says Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikan, 13 and 14-year-old drinkers usually appear in hospitals.
Prior to Hořvice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to go in maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when they brought it with 3.5 alcohol in the blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," said the department doctor on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at a dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother didn't even surprise him that his daughter was gone for 48 hours," the boss was surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of increased consumption of alcohol among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of dependence itself.
"Alcoholic means a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which is not produced in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a social or family environment systematically failed," explains Chief Pelikan.
According to the spokesperson Jurinová, this year at the pediatric clinic in Motol, 40 drunk children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics show only those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after medical recognition, go home with parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply meet after school and drink waiting, for Pelikan there are three seasonal heights that can be mentioned: the day of witches, End of Year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink for bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"On the day of witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunken children at once," says Pelikan.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a serum with glucose and the nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They take it much better, because after the harrowing night, they get up well and they don't hurt anything."
"Only they are confused about where they are," says Pelikan, adding that patients often lose the good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for severe patients cost a tens of thousands of crowns.
"I've often used the cost as a means of educating them, when in my visit I tell the children directly how much it cost to get drunk and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a job for young people to earn enough to pay that night," says Pelikan.
Medical insurance, in your opinion perhaps as a regression measure, that usually gives people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time a device like this is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad to make training or demonstration flights.
This is the two-way version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and which was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159 single.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales broker, Omnipol, has already taken over from them last week.
Jan Peješk, of the defence press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the aircraft will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single aircraft were, on the other hand, separated from the fixed aircraft long ago, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The two-way L-159T1 were exchanged in their present state," Právo Pejšek said.
He added that the army is not left without two-way aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for a sum of 200 million crowns for the construction of four non-necessary L-159 bi-season devices.
One of the new planes had already received it by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed to the addition of aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that the EADS company is the one that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and will serve for the practices of NATO pilots."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a home plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3,500 million crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for a bid for purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence leadership claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes is likely to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already notified the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by making a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the latter should arrive at Kbely airport in 14 days.
A longer index finger than anular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men with the longest rate than the annular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
They could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as Eeles indicates.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the left hand finger shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same chances of suffering prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men below 60 per cent, the reduction reached 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "extremely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czechia, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday snow-covered.
Roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and the machines left all night for many areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between the 89 and 93 kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several accidents in industrial vehicles and tourism, just like the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ústředního Automotoklubu (UAMK).
In the 91st mile, a truck was found, and in 93 it hit two industrial vehicles that caused injury.
A number of tourists also ended up in the kennel.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at 185 km to Prague.
There they hit two trucks.
Drivers must move slowly after Brno in the 190 km or cross Brno and join the 182 km in Kývalce.
It has been formed several kilometers.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 °C.
Sequencs, for example, are being formed in Prosek, although it is also congested Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams are running late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three quick.
The problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně airport closed from eleven o'clock in the night of Wednesday until five in the morning.
Currently, it can now be circulated by most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, Brněnska is forming snow languages, and Blanenska needs chains to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Connections are currently closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, millers will be required.
It cannot be said at the moment when the circulation will be opened.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region which, since it is a protected natural zone, should simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, as indicated by ČTK.
In Chechia they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reached 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, they fell about 15 centimeters of snow.
The snows are gradually rebounding in Chequia.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the moment only by the name coded XMMS-25.
The generals expect the new rifle to influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" to make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise tip.
His bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm-calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point that is found in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind obstacles, walls, or trenches.
Without a doubt, normal protection cannot be used, and when it launches its deadly rain from metal astillas, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses a "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun is loaded and the projectile is launched at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three metres," Audette points out.
400 jobs are being moved
Fujitsu consortium relocates its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu relocates his branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer industry giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad district, Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered by the region, will be housed there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection with the airport is currently very important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
The head of the Frankfurt economics section, Markus Frank (CDU) said that this has won a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent recognition of the location".
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great impulse for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger's mayor, Michael Korwisi (Green People) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The address first informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons led to the fall.
In this way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building show cooperatives."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining Marienbader Platz buildings for ten years of a controversial project for the construction of the seaside city.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive construction that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and the level of buildings.
In 2001 the investment consultancy and pricing companies, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was purchased by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Cancen-Grouppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, from Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest global IT provider.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and it also provides accurate services.
The branch office in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That's why they've rented 7,000 square meters in the office building of Astro Park.
The old complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnique and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Threats against Assange
Anxiety is becoming more and more seized by Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the Revelation platform from its server.
Possibly behind political pressure is found after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, apparently is detained in England.
Wikileaks' revelation platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are currently looking for an Internet country in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and businesses to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's search list, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations communicated through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Just before, the internet company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon Services website to address high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we will spend our dollars on hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its server through Wikileaks, after a Senator Joe Lieberman employee had requested investigations, reported the CNN chain as a call to Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with boycott, British "Guardian" reported.
"I had hoped that Amazon would take these measures before, before the previous information publications classified by Wikileaks," the Senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and reckless process of Wikileaks puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," he said in a statement by the independent senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to spread stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is wanted in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's search list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has consistently classified Sweden's research as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's security, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to North America's statements.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the person responsible for Wikileaks' revelations must be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, a councillor from the head of government Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange there is a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, American President Barack Obama's spokesman, called "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had requested the resignation of the Secretary of State, in case she was responsible for recently ordering diplomats involved in spying.
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The US government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of Distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed an exceptional manager, announced the White House.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks' filtration.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that in order to manage the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done all we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The college of ice cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream is prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice creamers has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice cream really come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The ice cream produces cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice cream spreads with a spatula the ice cream of the counter, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, there is no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice creams, should not visit the "Gelat University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream college with the freezer in 2003 to ensure that ice cream from his machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice creamers has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more days-long special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in the home's ice cream.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk in the gentle iced their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries across the continent, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this California art, loves the slow food movement and in the future wants to offer a quality European product on the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of his own in a few years in an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an iceberg in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams of his bars, and a Canadian housewife Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice creams.
The ice-cream master Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not just his good taste but also his silky softness and his good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation nor the cream cover of the national superior house and mostly of the south of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why each ball has something romantic."
The first step in the process seems very easy.
Luciano casts the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powder milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large beater, which warms everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine tap and come out a pasteurized white basic cream, the base for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without stilizers?
How can you give free rein to some tastes of experimenting?
Luciano advises to be rid of the trends of the time.
He who speaks of ice cream "not only natural ingredients", has used better stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar rubber, of guar beans.
Of course it can be made ice cream without stabilizer, only one day have to buy it, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite iced sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
They use aromas.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweets section of the supermarket.
Plus, there's dust and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavoured ingredients in their merchandise."
"But you must try it once."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the cream of ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the participants in the course can use the ice creamers.
Luciano lets you develop four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
It doesn't necessarily depend on it to have more toffe aroma or more fruit purée.
There is no need for hazelnut ice cream to be known to dry fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group elaborates the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is an artichoke problem: Melocoton pure is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar ratio of the basic recipe must be lowered.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano pulls out a tool that sets the amount of sugar of the fruit types (medition of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the account.
Illustrating ice cream requires only physical application, as before.
Not only does it help the tool for the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, which simultaneously beats the ice mixture prepared and cools at temperature below zero.
In spite of everything, all automation is left out as to the small paste.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puré, as if it were a giant miniprimar without control.
"In all the courses," says Master Luciano, "it's only a matter of time that passes something like this."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experiencing transgenic plants.
The Group of Experts Testbiotech, which is now considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology, formulates this matter.
"It seems a conspiracy theory but we have not documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa's group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert has also been engaged for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the standards for the verification of Efsa of genetically modified plants, which places it in a clear conflict of interest, critical Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the company's writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa was without the support or the transition time to Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and he has changed with that his band.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which took place at the General Environment Office as well as a clear EU parliamentary leader.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, including for the risk assessment of biotechnology without Lobby's responsibility.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, does genetically modified corn in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice consists of verifying only isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you're not looking for risks, how are you going to find them?" he asked, the accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, both in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
So there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a rule.
"Industry controls security investigation," Hilbeck maintains.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell has got some, in total, 400 kilos.
On Monday he was at Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on his back.
There were demonstrations
Snow.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to take down a large piece of the northern wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Miles and thousands manifested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was strapped, most of the wing was made of debris.
Rotates 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He is excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he's forgotten the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The Stone Trail of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in a previous French Navy ammunition warehouse, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, trouble the gravel or send it to the trash," says a house of wood in his office, which once was a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explained, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing to the wreckage company.
He talked to the 21S enemies for several days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about the fall.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80 kilograms cut, with a price per Slice from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a reminder but also in the hope of being able to restore it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Gardening owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from all over and took what they could carry in the trunk and on.
Stuttgart's stone of impulse has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
Go to his turret, take a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
It carries its treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones carved.
"They belonged to Dresden Marienbrücke's bridge," he explains.
Caliza alba, yellow, warm, excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Sign a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Goodly translated."
In ancient times, the massives belonged to the gallery of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the Stuttgart police chief, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, toba of Heilbronner's hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he carved the stones first and moved them with a simple apparatus and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something destroyed."
It has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people had to do the stone dealer, in addition to singers, a sculptor, asmith, a glass maker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the man in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Battle of talents around great potentials
Queens an active influx in the buffet.
16 students flock around the pans, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Vokswagen car manufacturer have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, you have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
By reevaluating and in the same way, many companies, like VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Their mission: To hire more talented students from universities as soon as possible before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on their students' skills, they try to challenge exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady in the staff department distributes pens, rubbers and folders with the VW logo.
It explains to young talents the training programmes and the work for students and shows them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
It has advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, watch interesting candidates more closely and consider them as possible future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point earlier was in the technical projects," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
If they do not have to be announced and, above all, to obtain a highly qualified workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacancies in October.
And, according to the VDI forecasts, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for the hunting of talent.
Organize expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a modern type of yincan, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US the following year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG’s subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the cream cream of many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and clean up the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the mass."
"The simple journey itself was only a short one."
For the Dykta Zattalents the notes give results.
"Today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some are near their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also on hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classics with their job fairs.
"We're trying to get students at the specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sita Stübe, in charge of staff for Solarworld Solar Technology Manufacturer.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacant posts appear on the company's website.
"It's being very complicated to fill the vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter road is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that they can practice with us or carry out their thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: Personal environment, plain hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium can't normally offer it," says Stübe, the staff officer.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance for children or good opportunities for promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld holds square 55 out of the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute prepares an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what you ask the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff member also expects extra points in his classification for his applicants to work.
"I think the applicant is particularly focused on the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from Deutschen Employment Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy that earns a good reputation as employers.
It advises its customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer goes through the employees themselves," he says.
The company's business is called Internal Branding, also promoting corporate identity within its own staff.
"A satisfied employee is the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get direct promotion for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drills
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thus annulled its previous plans unappropriately.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new drillings for the moment remain.
This announced the interior minister, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What caused this strict prohibition, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the misfortune that cost eleven workers their lives and caused the biggest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings to the west of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce the dependence of the US on new foreign oil supplies.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A research commission commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, raised the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various petroleum consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to discard a new catastrophe by using harder controls and stricter safety regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which, after being charged with charges of corruption, has fallen into disrepute, is reformed from the root.
Obama announces in parallel that the lucrative tax gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total gulf extraction will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, so far.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey carried out by the counseling company BDO - before the prohibition of extraction of Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows what changes exactly with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects will soon be extended to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marble, smells like a gas station: Millions of crudely poured liters have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on the theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist calms the journalists: "You'll pass enough oil today in front of your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys walking in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulences on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not seen that on the surface brown oil stains float.
He used to grab leg-to-legs here, explains Esther Badom on the edge of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small city of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the world's most appetizing regions.
On the road to the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown broth, which dives its hand into the water, will bring out a few full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark royal trees, sad to isolate the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain they look for bird bands, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside is shut, a kind of phantom calm of an anterior paradise with smell of gasolinera expands in it.
"What's happening here is an ecological struggle," says Ouraño, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The war compares.
The area of the ogoni settlement is a resounding battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke out more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to put his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil workers.
Even today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is forbidden: While pumping more than two million black gold barrels daily from the entire delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters exceled steel platforms like water carvings: "Nativity trees" affectionately called the heads of the drilling machines.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At every moment a head is missing, says Akpobari, then sends a constant rush of oil in the water.
According to experts, over two billion liters have been poured into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrated, as in the wreckage of the "Exxon Valdez" ship 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see the heads to break and the pipes with leaks as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mostly low safety standards normally in the world the conventional, reputed scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the fault indices of the pipes are "about a larger multiple than elsewhere".
In one place, which from far away seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil under the free sky appears, figures from among mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Between one of the many barrels, which are sometimes linked to perforations, sometimes scattered arbitrarily on the ground, fires a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil is warmed in the fire for hours, Michael, the group leader.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drips and eventually comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees daily produce up to four 300-litre diesel barrels: "We bring about 34,000 naira", about $22.
Delta inhabitants exploit fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of just EUR 40-cent per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which called the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this stage at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military positions, keep the best part in ajibes and sell it cheap in the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academic on whether the environmental catastrophe is due more to the management of the population or the weak way of production.
"If the oil tankers did not behave like invaders and would not have completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the ogoni are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that only a deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like China."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear," says Muscle Ömann.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If the special army unit takes illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, but with a painful blow.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This condemned invention has completely cut our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Airbus passengers in Qantas who made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than you can imagine: Australian air security authorities perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and alert a possible factory defect.
The defect potential has complicated impacts: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft in the A380 series.
Among them is Qantas-Airbus who had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal means against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit at the Sidney Federal Court, which made it possible for more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the early November incident.
In the engine brand have lost parts and its wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will carry out more safety tests for superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman of ATSB.
The security problem has become sufficiently important to inform all affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas device, the airline kept its fleet A380 on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three out of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa rejected the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada all over the country causes traffic chaos
Total white Germany: From one day to another has snowed in almost all the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter ice Germany: Nearly the whole country reached freezing temperatures on Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 cm thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and many streets.
In the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the chitanyes are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects living tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on highways and on national roads.
According to Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds take care of it.
There they were trapped during the night many trucks and cars.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported important street messes.
In the A2, the snow and the wind paralyzed traffic and created jams.
In Turingia the snows affected A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the trees fallen on the roads or the ruined chainry and the holes are the main problems.
In Saxony the interurban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Turingia a train ICE had to stop his trip to Munich.
The firefighters and rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
The snowy winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, the snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesman of the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The discharges are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers parked at the airport, despite that there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker died on a collision with a train at a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered mild injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow streets: Here too a truck was reached on a road crossing because the vehicle was trapped.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the trip from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after giving her car a ride near Aschaffenburg on a rocky road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and dusty and will therefore be held in soft cracks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will surely continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deoche Bank wants a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could provide up to EUR 500 million.
Recently Deutschen Bank settled its headquarters: The twin towers were modernized in the Banking district of Frankfurt; as the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium wants in appearance to profit from the costs of relaunch, and seeks a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland states, based on a spokesperson.
The spokesman does not appoint the reasons for the sale on the project.
"We always check whether we should own the properties or sell them and then rent them back," he said.
That is why the largest credit institution in Germany renouncing its company’s headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a fund of the house and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached some EUR 200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
The experts in this field calculate the value of the towers of the renowned newspaper as "Greentowers" in about 500 million euros.
If the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or an independent investor has not been revealed at present, the spokesman said.
Thousands of mourning persons by the miners who have died
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought about buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not been found, however, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between 17 and 62 years of age were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced into the place of misfortune, but no sign of survival was discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue equipment could drop for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts argued that there was no possibility that the miners would have survived.
They have not been able to recover the bodies to date.
Family and friends today remind the deceased of a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright sunlight in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also personal pictures and objects, under clothes and surfboards.
The flags waved on average even to the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative act.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Together with the president of the government and the family members of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
The rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the island of southern New Zealand.
As soon as explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures inside the mine will begin to descend, Gary Knowles, the police superior, told journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
The gore fits in the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn again explores the borders of the genre with his epic battles "Walhalla Rising".
What audience would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought about when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior arrested with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and tear up his enemies the chips of his living bodies when he is in bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is called in reality, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters get carried away by a lot of one or two phrases or a couple of painful death cries.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the builders offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown filmmakers and interested in existentialism and in very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a shame that they cannot rule out each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and trilogy about the drug dealer hair "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he is essentially denied to make his works for all the public with something more humorous in the main current or something less of the brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and a bunch of shoots that sprout can't deter most followers of the artistic cinema.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons, and an eternity is stuck in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shut up again there.
It's a shame that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a movie distributor in Germany and is only posted on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the alleged and bloody facade, it hides a piece of cinema sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film does not deal with dialogues or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into a film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is just a moment of relaxation and its glacial images and the lugure trance soundtrack make him a nude in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, that from the hearts of the characters goes toward him.
Only a young blonde, who supports Unojo faithfully, retains something like innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of a single eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, to change and to be surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Land Movements
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to take an opinion on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the average night of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the nearest and largest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it deals with a reactor that appeared to have been built by Syrians with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley emerging from the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA of late April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the proximity of El-Kibar very suitable for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are constructed.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from nearby or inside.
The reactor had been running for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later from the bombing, it is hardly more known than at that time, the riddles became bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that prior to the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in El-Kibar, but that he had just seen signs that there was a "nuclear weapons programme" in the country.
In Europe, a number of secret service officers prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "sub-reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation to be "appreciable".
They lack solid evidence, as well as IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat replied in summer in a stoning manner that IAEA has "sufficient material to have questions."
The Syrians quickly stripped themselves of the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and spread the ground to consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinnonen found uranium tracks in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, IAEA has obtained satellite images about a Member State, of commercial sellers at the moment following the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA submitted.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always realized that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium proceeded from Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
IAEA rejected it as an inverse after analysis of the particles.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss it, as well as with regard to satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited from a second inspection in el-Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombarded building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and “proceeds progressively to a serious problem of credibility for the authorities”, as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious breach is finally pending against the non-proliferation treaty for atomic weapons, under which IAEA operates.
IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not made public until the time the teams are treated, or what functions they have, or if they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the proximity of the cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is likely to be on or immediately next to a military base, Syria prohibits the entry into the IAEA for this reason.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear a record that the United States has requested IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment through U.S. Secret Service warnings.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three locations and the cube on the shore of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams can be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "significance of sensitive activities", no enrichment of uranium or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should then be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargo from the ground trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the debris remains.
OIAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine unlikely, located within the few kilometres from el-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for their ability as a radioactive waste area.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the photographs from orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected sites and removed large containers after IAEA requested entry.
It may be random, but it just helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has used a few months to develop a inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, in order to maintain the possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
In the meantime, Damascus is also critical of this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, which is why the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador, has been crying out for exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Vietnamese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who has to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still wavers.
This road is very risky: To do so, most of the IAEA's governing council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for a climb.
On the other hand, as one diplomat thought, "What if they find nothing?"
Love in Times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her debut still unnamed.
She herself wrote the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
You don't know much more about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, is in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have protested rapidly, so at last they have moved a few days of planned shooting in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hassecic of the female war victim organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She's not diplomatic, women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hassecic.
There are no stories of love in the fields of rape, and Jolie's position in this regard tells the victims enough about the script.
His organization in accordance with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture that read the script, granted a strip and loosens a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not quite clear why Jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, is very hard into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give voice to all the parties involved.
Its contents are still inaccurate.
On the network there is a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian field in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the "victim of rape is in love with torturers".
It is certain that Jolie's film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, like many others previously.
Nothing like far from here
This afternoon is finally good again for the Irish.
No sign of distress
On the other hand, the household team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout for joy while retumbling loud music, beat the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in the Sudanese Cork, because the players are launching, and they find, pingong balls to the beer vessels from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the winner's prize is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this strange drinking game and the discreet computer actually don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with that, to distract himself from the fulminating question, what the future will look like.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's far from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from one shot he got the job of his dreams as event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, his brother Colin currently works as IT advisor in Londrés.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and the ESRI Social Research Institute in Dublin.
Until 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The predictions are confirmed, a migratory wave is coming comparable to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great well-being to the Irish people, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis mainly confuses young, well-trained Irish people, for whom up to now everything is costing.
Loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are in unemployment.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
"There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it a whole generation."
"The last that closes the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future appear because the government is only dedicated to assembly and no longer offers future prospects for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have strategies to get new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Notice how your peers go from unremunerated practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career," says the manager.
On its website you will find photos of a boy practicing surf in Australia and another practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, but it involves freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan knows what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing more to be done for the 29-year-old engineer, I now work with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they raise a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, Hannover or Berlin will go to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only few times because he works extra hours to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, because it's been a long time since he first stepped on the threshold of his house.
"They make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes for ice-cream rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parking large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house along with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a credit.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," she says.
Are you afraid of failing credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, it serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in past times here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and tells himself about his father, who in the last big economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and simply see what life is like elsewhere.
He already worked a couple of years in London and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend in New Zealand go well?
But in these days, there is one thing that concerns you about it: the celebration of your 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid he can degenerate into a farewell party.
"Only not too many emotions," she says and gives a big drink to her beer.
"Goodbye, it sounds very distressing."
"Better we call her a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private enterprises.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a country that is more influential than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows for monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related issues are highlighted in the results of this year's survey in September and early October.
The first is the relatively animated mood reigning in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Graph 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but significantly higher than 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but significantly higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is probably because many Latin American countries have only been affected by a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in conditions of poverty is only marginally increasing in 2009 and has declined again this year to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the start of the surveys, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, such as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
About 31 per cent claims that they or a close relative have been the victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has been reduced since 38% last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see Figure 6).
About 58 per cent agrees that the market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, compared with 47 per cent last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% supports private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country that has greater leadership in the region, as it indicates 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, same as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by the respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela bears this title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Waste Elections
No one expected the general elections held in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
However, they went far worse than the foreigners who were afraid of trying to help the country to go back to their problems.
Votings were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, paperwork thrown in the sewers, destroyed electoral schools and intimidation.
Election schools opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, were wandering around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community warned that "we do not think that these irregularities, however serious they are, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular president, and with his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The deployment is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for the elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, an old first lady, have withdrawn their initial request requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who hardly has support, if any, has moved to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is raging in the country and more than one million earthquake survivors are still living in shops, a great abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity papers, required to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the choice of a popular and legitimate government to be an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has become clear, Haitians also think so.
Moving forward from stitches to center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public who has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, up to more than 50%, the highest level that she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite all this, which can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández puts aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the extra income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs Fernández's government lost most of her in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after the death of Kirchner due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the peronist movement in power have faced Mrs. Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which a member punched each other in his face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply next year, which will provide the President with an even greater margin of action when it is spent.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1 per cent, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the labor requirements of the trade unions, are about 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction their priorities rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández modify these policies now?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, their officials claim that they want to limit wage increases by around 18 per cent in the year.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a high devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bond holders who had refused a prior forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped into the Paris Club, which is owed about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve supervision of the IMF, as it is usually customary.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for domestic consumption, which appears to be the prelude to the cleaning of INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics at the end of her term of office, bearing in mind that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If you do, you will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has become tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether you reject or not, calmly, many of your husband's policies.
Half Scream by China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What do Taiwan think about her big brother on the other side of the street?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the eligible, arrived on 27 November to choose mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what seems to be a broad assessment by the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a defender of feelings across the continent, forging innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but little by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PDD), which has tended to be completely independent of Taiwan, had almost 50% of all votes against 45 per cent of KMT.
If they were the presidents, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote ratio has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD drew on the KMT in the municipalities.
The elections saw the typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with flag and light girls dancing clothes.
Nor did it miss the mysterious attempt to murder rigor.
Sean Lien, Lien Chan's son, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young man straight into the face, wounding him and killing a transecent.
Curiously, it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or avenge the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PPD leader, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean on the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it was not the continent's issue itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public accommodation plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging feelings against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma said that his policy with regard to China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese people.
It is expected that the Beijing Government will continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to get Taiwan to return to the ground.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing will be to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to pass.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
The President was openly instigating explicit independence between 2000 and 2008.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is working to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who has served under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced the plans for the establishment of a group of experts acting as a focal point between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Mrs. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustful alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to appear to the presidents.
Even without Mr Chen interceding, the PPD will have difficulty in choosing among its potential candidates.
KMT must also conduct a conscientious examination.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman claims that he will restructure his cabinet, as well as local teams.
The large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan's support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese feel that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has been crossed."
Grammy nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist Revelation.
It acts at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer personally selected by President Obama to act in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, assumed one of the Grammys surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Taking into account that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since its 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but it respects the rules of the Grammys according to which it must be an artist who has not taken out more than three albums before recording what "determins the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly made a big move and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great ability with influence of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, can at least set a distinction between Spalding and the path to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have recently concentrated on the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and techlist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite star in New Orleans and usual guest in "Treme", HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, which, for the rest, leans considerably toward fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained a well-deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the great camera jazz of the Billy Children Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with its octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bassist on his band.
Grammy Awards Nominations: Michael Daughterty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
The nominations in the area of classical music for the 53rd edition of Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by "God Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for an eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with ties to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also appointed by his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra albums, opera, coral and solo.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical music album are Bruckner for the Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughterty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No 4, Daughterty for "God Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionally Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Grafiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, of approximately 30 minutes, is supported by "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concert" of Dorman is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for her to be played in Avi Avivital mandolina, which played the concert with the Ensemble Metropolis, based in New York.
"The composition with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms in North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was appointed in the category of orchestra function, by directing the Chicago Symphonic Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.
Among the appointed instrumental soloists are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The appointed vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains approval from the Board of Directors
The temecula mosque project has received unanimous support from the local commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying that it promotes terrorism and stalemates.
However, the members of the committee decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews and the Bahaites, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"Shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loudly."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting started at six in the afternoon and lasted almost until half a night; most of the time was dedicated to people who interceded for or against the centre, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the journal ' s website.
"United States no longer exists", read in one of the comments.
"It's another Planet of the Seeds with Mrs. Libertad dying in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The construction plans of Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including close to the zero area, the New York area where the attacks on 11 September 2011 took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmous has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living safely in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a water filter system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4,32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents are still able to turn the project to the City Council.
A microbio resistant to arsenic poses the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients broadened the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers have discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say that it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it a very peculiar thing, although little is missing to be a really 'alien' way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of Thursday of the publication Science.
For a long time, there have been six major elements that are essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what more is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
As Anbar pointed out, finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbio discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "shows it is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider essential for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, at Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for another in the biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's astrobiology institute, which led the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so it speculated that a microbes exposed to both could replace one by another.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, it can be complicated for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, the arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work as well as the phosphorus, so it comes in and, in some ways, it calls the biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
Researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing arsenic concentrations, which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbial grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that it can exist naturally a form of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an auxiliary professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but there has never been an example that proves it works.
The arsenic was more common in the early Earth's eras, he said, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have used it.
"Yes, he suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," Foster said, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The stolen dogs have been found missing in Compton
The two dogs that were missing from the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel were found, according to the sheriffs of Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi Welsh Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, according to the authorities.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found on Wednesday, late at night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff's department.
"The good news is that dogs find themselves well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They have returned with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were, what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't mean anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following a few clues."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make some comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a village animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis who Rickard and Peek intended to show in the competitions of the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukauba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and had the intention of exhibiting Trace.
The other dogs were going to show them in other scheduled competitions for the days prior to the AKC/Eukauuba championship, as indicated to The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the nearly two-month tour that the couple performs participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
Usually they stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of your room.
They took three other dogs (a boxer's brood, a parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a very thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported theft of the van on Tuesday at six o'clock in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM achieves the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally obtained green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to eliminate approximately $5 billion in debt, leading the 86-year entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of films and television programs.
The decision on Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relaunch under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned credit instrument of $500 million to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which is on its own contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management needed to order their finances, while fighting to be able to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in recovering bankrupt businesses, known for his work at Krypy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussion, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and disagreement, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM is officially out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-millionaire bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper's companies, who have been collecting $375,5,000 a month for their company's management services, will receive a $4 million "successful fees".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which released only one film this year, and gathered an annual slate of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to make a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of your gift budget
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant mile in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five 99-dollar BMX bicycles each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jumpstrings decorated with accounts, or about 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for balanced gifts.
I recently visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known ones, Webkins and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys powered by button batteries are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and over) are toys of stuffed with the size of a guinea pig singing a note when its barrels are tightened.
A squeezer is equivalent to a note, and a second squeezer begins to set up a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For song combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking the Elmo Live technology of last year, the 14-inch animatronic wrist plays shift change games like Simóm Dece, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with locking device.
Children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, even though his parents complained about lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and over), with a backpack full of letters of questions designed to convert a car ride into a session with a notebook of autocorrection exercises occurring.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smart phone, here you will encounter three independent alternatives.
MobiGo VTech (60 dollars, from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, from 3 to 12 years old), it is the first important point on the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes type system to present games and ebooks, and has a slot for SD cards that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a box of glasses, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to set words by placing the blocks in line before time runs out; it is formidable for an improvised word-arming competition.
They are increasingly toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on its presence in toys, the two largest are Webkins and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, from 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include skates on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
It is slightly larger than the pig in its toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and over) is the last in a microbot line powered by button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly over 12 silicone legs that vibrate, in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside our dog's mouth.
Promoting a more moderate side of order maintenance in China
As an urban sergeant, Tang Shenbin took the step in a square of the city, inspecting the nervous people in his charge severely, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chegwan, the corrupt police of the city order of China, feared and despised by their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Sign up!"
"Be careful!"
Show them, whisper, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with white gloves and identical green olive jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, disgracefully.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of the urban inspectors in China.
A city ordered all new recruits to have a degree degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grey green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a snack cart, and observed it with the whipped belt constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women, specifically elected by their appearance, proportion and youth, to their urban police.
The idea is to give the police cough a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's minimal respect for these squadrons in the city.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city orders, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, the Hubei Province inspectors hit a transecent after using their cell phone to film them while disbanding a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it was described how to effectively whip criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai sledge salesman suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents Chinese trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chenguan has left a scar on the government," China Daily, a national publication, was lamented last year after another tactical controversy.
The newspaper demanded "a truly meticulous cleaning."
The sceptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district applied for eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Eventing News asked whether women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's notice called for female candidates from 18 to 22 years old, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial traits".
They should have a height above the average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a nearly governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
Women's Chegguans are like florists, he said, and he added, "Besides being florists, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not looking forward to supporting that description.
But he noted that the height requirements were standard in many Chinese labor notices for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means betting, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, the disabled or disfigured must not appear.
"We can't let a person take or a jorobado come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Plaza Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His workmate, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said, "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also do not oppose their work on time, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply jostling sellers on the streets where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen street vendors who walk on foot or bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu pans or cups as possible before being released.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We have told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his car pulled by bicycle with noodles.
The officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his free hours.
Very routine.
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to denounce the offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, were mutiny after the false rumor that a vendor had been murdered by Chegguan officials was spread.
More than a dozen police or police officers were injured in the nighttime; 14 government vehicles were thrown or set on fire.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is barely guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people met in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The motorcycle owner screamed loudly.
The situation stopped for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened their way to their cars and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, aged 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, 40-year-olds or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li naturally.
"Most of the time is the public who starts fighting."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
The Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice have excused Senator John Ensign from the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to ensure work through lobbying for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat Ensign faced, the Republican of Nevada who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate by 2012, until the scandal over his business had national headlines last year and had damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he felt "surely happy" for the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plans to raise charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said that there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have been repugnant to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that first appeared in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, about the Senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded according to the law of lobbying for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict that former state employees use their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy in order to substantially violate the status revolting door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious when accepting political proceedings after several important reviews for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges for misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the following day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted according to the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable getting into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an inquiry into a complaint separated from the ethics group, which claims that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to Hamptons violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was no more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who obtained work through lobbying thanks to Ensign's assistance to Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's head of cabinet, John Lopez, he communicated with Hampton and told him that he was "maching" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called on the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to do lobbying.
When first news of the affair appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, Ensign told journalists two weeks ago that he planned to apply for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude his investigation.
" Senator Ensign has a desire to continue with his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There was half a dozen of them chatting in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minutes a minute, they sent reports of the amazing testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were over 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the process largely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have written in the court setting out the arguments of appeals that will probably be in court for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "an atmosphere of circus", and such a widespread and immediate saturation with exciting details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appeals judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I have experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief advocate of Mr. Hayes' defense.
Trial Judge Jon C. Blue of the State High Court categorically rejected the claims in a judgement last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been led by passion.
But it's probably not the last word on the subject.
For decades, the appeals courts have recognized that the coverage of famous cases may generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historic ruling in 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television program and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be necessary to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of the new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford's School of Laws, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report stating that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials more fair.
Twitter's issue is just one of many of the themes outlined by Hayes lawyers, who will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes might have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the jurors' reactions, showing them spooky photographs of the crime scene during the jury's selection.
Some jurors have said that they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, Hayley, 17-and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury who had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had wrongly pressured a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to act for a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But its arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media constantly cast firewood from emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," lawyers wrote, "it was something that was never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in the whole state."
Your attention to Tweeter's coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly, was a ludicrous vision that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the appeals courts often felt attracted by the arguments about the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In its writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which repeals Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would require the new means to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the twenty-first century."
Can the civic hold a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invectiveness and negativity, this week a little civilism has been unleashed in Washington.
Is it an ominous predance of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
The meeting of Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not make any progress on the major issues to be dealt with during the outgoing session.
But as they all say, it was at least a short discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to rule, rather than being another empty episode to win partisan points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the president's deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is just enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a period of testing, and each other is being examined to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while attempting to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent evaluations by the participants was made was with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid change in the climate that existed over the past two years.
Whether they are taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are in the opposite poles.
However, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to how to say things," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections awaken passionate passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
On some issues, in particular those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions are won at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich by denying unemployment subsidies for the unemployed.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, there is greater optimism for possible treatment of these issues during the outgoing session, together with the ratification of the new START Nuclear Disarmament Pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation in the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
On the contrary, he stated that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement begins.
"After the things that have to be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will revert the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civilism can lead to genuine cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the creation of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who contributed decisively to their creation.
Despite their awareness of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they should try to fulfill their promises to cut the state's expenses and nullify the new health law.
These lines of support are already clearly reflected in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase of certain taxes and the retirement age, and the cut of expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forced the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected to the panel, suggesting that there are at least few bases or wishes for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will take place next year in the form of positive shocks, when the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bi-partisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will observe with attention the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks he's losing will probably change course and look for compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
partisanism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans of Congress than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental choice in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points on matters that still divide them.
A leaked American document depicts Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that it collects directly to the Kremlin, according to the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle enormous blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal groups.
Every step of the bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority", takes its part as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it was largely the fault of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleansing ever since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied the charges of corruption over the years, and he has won several demands per libel on such charges.
In September, when on a Russian television channel he was asked about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, it's a gang, it's a mess."
According to polls, the Russians believe in an overwhelming way that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy's report, and it is unheard that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to affirm that the government works more like a cleptocracy than a government," the note states.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means "the roof" or protection) that passes over the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"The analysts identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"SFS, MVD and militia are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects the money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, said the report, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that the best thing is to get the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that, while the collection of money is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed by one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that it has achieved little progress.
The embassy's note reports about men taking bags, probably full of cash, within the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of India's group of experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no more a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, said corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified as 154 (the countries are classified at least as the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur until late in the night Moscow's hour, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and despite that Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that claimed that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was made in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemeres forced to face the past
In a concrete, dimly lit classroom, with spotted and peeled walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man that he had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemeres Ta Mok.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the administration of the Red Jemeres, the commander continues to be popular in this remote former fortress of the Red Jemeres in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemeres surrender to the government, the long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation enabled victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Jemeres to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations-Cambodia mixed court issued the first conviction of a former member of the Red Jemeres, condemning the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Twins of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate to Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Twins was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the Cambodian Red Jemeres government, between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork, approximately 1.7 million people.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and defeated the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and their military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that occurred in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemers combatants began to desert to the government, culminating in the returns of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Red Jemeres fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few red Jemeres elite officials kept their local administrative posts in exchange for their weapons, the foot soldiers remained poor and unqualified farmers.
"These people have gained little benefit after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept to do business."
Sor Lim, aged 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemeres was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok gave him food for everyone."
"But now life is difficult because we have to self-sufficient."
The current court of the Red Jemeres has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin processing Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemeres.
The mandate of the court is to prosecute major leaders and those with greater responsibility for crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This didn't serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district head in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the administration of the Red Jemeres in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had supervised the construction of Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent bochornosa afternoon, Im Chaem again worked in the fields at his house on wooden pilots on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the rice pasture, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She stated that if the court called her, she would not be presented.
"Cambodia is in peace and stability," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted Red Jemeres in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, even if experts and historians question him.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to rejoin the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first book of text approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Red Jemeres, despite the link between the city and the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted sceptically when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the text book and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people who will prosecute the court."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Anyway, the Red Jemeres here keep a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a black holliny rectangle covered by a oxidized roof of leafy.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tires after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, aged 31, a cell vendor on the edge of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray him," he said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas hoping to have good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its qualified uranium reserve for arms
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without returning last spring.
But the U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations classified with Belarus in the last two months were conducted to withdraw 84.82 kg of uranium qualified to arm a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for the Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the topic.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And by the way, it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I really felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This demonstrates that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundred kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for weapons) and low enrichment uranium," said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our raw material... we're not gonna manufacture dirty bombs, and we're not gonna sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, showing an interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials stated that the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, since the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said he was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to the officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out on a plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of research with low enrichment uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an officer of the Department of Energy working in the Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was carefully coordinated and orchestrated to strengthen trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation towards 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of the harsh repression of Lukashenko of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential distraction.
It was stated that "while the progress in these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repair the CIA's flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda headed to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, as the US Ambassador in Madrid stated on a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents filtered by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercise appropriate monitoring of foreign planes crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe in which it accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting took place between former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"From Vega stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights across Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "prevented caught," says Aguirre on a cable.
Also the then foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence."
For its part, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to seek the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any criminal elements or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. has reflected its concern at the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the disclassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case quietly between governments," Aguirre laments.
In March 2007 at a lunch between US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he was told that "although the Spanish judges are horribly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of rhetorical inflamed, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the performance of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero Government has deliberately tolerated or ignored US actions that could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government," he points out.
The priestly confession complained on the net of the "agobio" of being a mother
The young woman spoke about the child when she was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which she used since childhood, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natural of Noia, the corrupt people of which she is from.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know your sentimental life, which ABC rebuilds through testimonies from his relatives.
The young Galician, aged 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tuñez, an industrialist.
It lasted a year.
When they left him, soon she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never lets him do the DNA test.
He soon got to know another novice.
The elect was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to test the labour market, the young woman stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her to Palma for a week.
But by the contents of the communications, it is seen that their romance broke, which broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca alone, and he writes, "Alberto is very weird and musqueated, because I've come to work."
"When I said so, it seemed good to him, but of course, he now realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not have freedom to do what he wants."
Then, he talks about a message to the mobile that he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me a direction to send you to the child."
She complains, "If you don't like me leaving my mother to the baby, I'll pick it up when I get back," she claims.
In May, he speaks of the return to his people: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm only going to be until 19, because 20 I have to introduce myself to a job not to lose it."
Clearly, if everything goes well with him, he takes his firstborn.
"He will be with whom he must, i.e. with me, and I will never be left again with anyone other than my mother," a questionable intention given his bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on 1st of that month, is supposed to be killed on 10th of the month, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
It's about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He will go there (the child) to some summer classes, and so I save some kangaroo paste."
On 17, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss of Caesar, which asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you, I don't know what videos to the email, see how when he wants to find me, he's got to screw up."
On the 30th, another, "The boy's fine, he's going to summer classes to learn Catalan."
De Víctor, his current partner, is one: "He's making money for me."
On the Internet there are your messages in blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the universe MySpace, now intervened, where he was called "Muki the excarculator."
"Terror in the cock (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, sworn guard, declares his grief for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe everything happened because he didn't tell him he was a single mother.
Monica joined the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the Menorca judicial detention centre.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "not having intended to cause harm to the minor."
He did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and MPs experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the view of the generals, because, whether it has progressed or not, prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes that this training obtains in these committees usually doubles what it receives in Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics, the figure was 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
To maintain this upward trend, which has been nurtured by a vote of the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts in this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CIU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (then 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member - now he has three - while ICV would stay with a Member or win one.
But, if the electoral timetable is to be maintained, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the people can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in its relevance to the head of the Barcelona Deputy, one of the most budgeted administrations that handles - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and people agree on the possibility that the CSP will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be surprising that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistio - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can lead the return to the Tarraconian capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Populars have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistani and the Nigerian officers of the General Police Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups in Al Qaida, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the last author of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Kampai operation" the Al Qaida falsification apparatus has been "weaked" internationally and therefore its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrate the Al Qaida criminal galaxy so that their "combatants" can cross European borders and from other Western countries with total impunity.
The remarkable cell is not the only one that the jihadist network operated in Europe, so that investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory in the next few days similar blows to that developed on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained, another took place in Thailand with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones that led from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passport tourists that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents should be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without visas.
In the media, it is stressed that at the moment no data has been found linking the arrested in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the receiving groups of stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "inverted" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by members of the "command" that ended with the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
PP requires Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had an opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur But his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to the absence of philosophical-sovereignist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people came to the meeting of Artur Mas with the assurance that he had obtained 18 Members in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make himself wanted, as the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will be carried out by the opposition is abstained in the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but for the time being the talks that are held these days but with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "will have to park all the sovereign and independent discourses", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a very inflated self-government and the elimination of inheritance tax and donations.
Details of the Mas investment negotiation will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICRC) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot don't rule out their captor killing more than 11 elders.
The managers of the administration La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while employed there killed at least eleven elders in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by counsel from the center, counsel Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to make the accusation against the responsible person" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to take up the procedural situation of civilian officials".
And it is that, in addition to the social defiance that the entity may suffer from the fact that it did not detect in time the criminal activities of the concealer, the great threat to the Caritat now assumes a substantive form of compensation that is already calculating the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and since then has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - who in many cases suspected that no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was issued by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, strongly denied yesterday this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures can at no time have been the cause of what has happened."
Counsel for La Caritat added that "there is no single indication that there has been an reckless action on the part of any other person other than the defendant himself."
He already baptized as "Angel de la Morte" confessed yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime committed him on August 29, 2009 for, a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by throwing an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to medicines.
Insulin dripping and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her attempt to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to put them to death.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify whether Vila is not lying and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, whether she hugged them inside, giving them read as she has already confessed that she did with the three women who killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the cello's manifestations, not even to the number of confessed murders, that they do not rule out being superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after he has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to the Trichet threat that warned "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
Peripheral differentials have strongly closed and the actions of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake and the euro has hardly re-calculated what is a worrying sign.
What has happened yesterday is the property of a liquid market that as it unfolds is recovered but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will delay in losing fear.
One month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and tomorrow will have to be retracted for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the long run and leaving just unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis we hope that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" will continue and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, may God assist us!
Just as at their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazouca on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the letter auction a year in Portugal has been very poor.
Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal dropped 30 basic points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures are some 10 billion short-term and another 15,000 potential and have up to February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
While Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get the parliamentary approval of its new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to prove that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been rapid and powerful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain asking for a Help Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, Treasury has more than 40 billion in available liquidity the triple that in March, at expensive rates and closes your access to the sine die markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's woman, "in addition to being, to say so."
Let's go, we can.
President of Eulen will challenge Vega Sicilia's board requested by their children
The time does not heal in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge it, considering it "full-right" the El Enebro judicial board of the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and be made with the management bodies of the signature holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesus David and Mary Joseph are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute for control by the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
Of his board of directors, five of his seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Market Registry.
The El Enebro judicial board for the next day 16, convened by the Mercantil Judge No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the Trunes box within the Alvarez family.
The use of the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is called by David Álvarez as a "despaired resort of the applicants' five children to, through procedural arguments, in clear law fraud and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null meeting of 18 January", according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the meeting, once it has been held, to challenge it by considering it to be "full-fledged".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already attempted to prevent the magistrate from convening a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a company owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims that the profit of 51 per cent of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This issue is the issue of substance that the judge must decide once the view on the demand for appeal is celebrated, for which there is not yet a particular date.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software design improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull broke out in the Formula 1 world in 2004, his story in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived scudery and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final line of the championship all waged for the triumph of the Ferrari del Fernando Alonso.
Without undermining the ability as a driver of the final champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor of the capacity of the Renault engine that propelles his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that Germany put on the market in 2007 for very long-distance ends of high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The goal is to play, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding errors and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the excavations in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their equipment who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-quality professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of changes in the boulders.
The manager of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull’s bolidays with the exception of the engine, which is Renault’s full responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can lead from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its balls in a locality about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The staff for this task is up to 580 people, including their two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero, no doubt, is the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists are hidden whose contest is invaluable and their notoriety is null.
The factory head of technology, Steve Nevey, said five years ago it could be claimed that the advances of R & D in cart cars contributed 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology amounts to 85% of success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer since they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive shop in collaboration are his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plan to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP España, Helena Herrero, set as an example the remodeled shop located in the Grand Via Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom he has been working for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being Barcelona's third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The HP director also assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trading network aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, care, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a worldwide pioneer pilot program to solve the potential problems of HP computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies have already hired technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bet a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell's CEO, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially discards a new crisis of liquidity and viticates the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it provides for a collapse of the margins of interest, which will try to compensate in part with increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to pick up a million private customers in three years, his pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years so that he can survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new master plan that will have a three-year operation.
The aim, in addition to surviving without the need to make use of FROB's public aid, is to gain market share with the uptake of one million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can get out of the bank are discounted, their large outstanding subject, since so far it has meddled more to SMEs and businesses than to retail customers.
This year has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its private market share is 3.5%, while in companies it is more than 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment by productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduced costs as an objective, and whose challenges the bank will expose them when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare at this time to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has overturned all plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year his Master Plan Optima, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made it expand one more exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardianiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," which is essential for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the liability war - which penalizes margins - is decreasing, the price of the risk premiums that are paying banks and boxes for their emissions for liquidity are already being transferred to the credit price to compensate for the margin drop.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already commanded his network Thursdays to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials -see FiveDays of November 22 and 27.
He also recognized that the bank's trend now "is to go to commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says in Spain "they're going to require larger sizes."
"The next year is going to move everything," he said.
It asserts that capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial entity enters red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can supply the market with funds for new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it remained important to what some bankers have already foretold as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC rejects a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers of savings boxes and insisted again on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the concentration process of Spanish savings boxes was started, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Boxes (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled yesterday that this new surge of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol to the Civic Bank group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
"The majority is completely done; it may be that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and backed up by the Banco de España, which has been very helpful too," the manager pointed out.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is taking place "at the greatest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied of how it is occurring within the deadlines that, in its day, were not now, marked in business plans with the Banco de España", he emphasized.
"To move from 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to fulfill Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense," because "what the Banco de España does is to remember that we have to be within the time frame before the end of the year."
The general director of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who put it into the fabric of trial a "lack of knowledge".
The Director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "it goes to as fast as possible".
It also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well stopped from stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Sapphire and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has established the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a double governmental response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies for placement or removal of 426 euros of aid to unemployed, up to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of airports in Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former president Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in discouraging the current crisis.
How do we interpret these movements?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another blowback in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashs with maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany begins to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, composed of itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, would leave the monetary zone in the south.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favourable flow of opinion, is close to 50 per cent of the population.
The third, a redrawal of the euro, in line with the proposals of the Germans of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments of any of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now they have no excuse.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government took out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (tax rigor plans and stability in public finances), and what its European partners were practicing, including France.
The second in the front gave it to the Central European country when Merkel pensibly extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was then the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the publication were very opposed to Greece's rescue.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, to make possible the saving of a country and at the same time to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should assist the Union reform process to enable those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn up a red line that does not plan to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree very much, from that date the old functioning of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the infringing countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The guest is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that today's turbulence will move towards greater tranquillity.
And that we take advantage of the window of opportunity that they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the the thesis of putting order at home has been opened.
But the red line Germany has traced there is, and it doesn't seem like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, to leave a monetary zone too steeped in less serious countries, cannot be excluded.
So Germany will always be able to tell us that you have already warned us.
Sport and law fraud
Such bullshit as Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax prove ingenious but not the will to escape a penalty.
The expulsion allegedly triggered by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party fought against Ajax on 23 November in the League of Champions has caused ink rivers to be written about whether such behaviour is anti-sportal and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As you well know, in a few minutes' time to finish the game (which your team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time to make mistakes to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction of the next party of the ligilla, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass cards clean at the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned two parties to the team coach, José Mourinho, and with various economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case reported is due to the fact that he has been led by a team of the Real Madrid entity (who in his hymn boasts of nobility and honor, and that he has sometimes fined his players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, apparently by Mourinho, who adds a more episode to his dilated history of his his histrionic and provocative technique.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour that is not expressly prohibited by the rules of procedure contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are committed by law fraud, because they are, in fact, respectful actions by the sports regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The issue is about examining the type of damage that causes the sports spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, something that with these actions was not put at risk, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is referred to in the clean game is to prevent the team of violators from taking unfair advantage of the opposite equipment, which did not happen either.
However, the paradox of the action of the players in Real Madrid is that it did not suit what we usually characterized as a trap or a fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid the punishment, but precisely its action sought to be the most evident in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders gain from the intended misdeeds examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that it is not put in a disadvantageous position for the rival or benefits in the same party, since the result of the action is obviously to leave the team with fewer players themselves.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next party either, because the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that may threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the equipment can be eliminated at first exchange rates, and also with this performance the players perform a penalty party and pass the second round of cards, in which the suspension for accumulating cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go around, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
Finally, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In the case in question, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is widespread, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises by two factors: because it was two self-expulsiones and the way in which the transmission of the guideline was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive of bids to capture Christmas dinners from groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for 16 and 17.
They proliferate self-sufficient celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turron and the lottery, with the arrival of December, the group dinners prior to Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloons for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which have resulted in a price offensive set to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, match the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed.
In order to end the accounting process, this year's calendar (when the Nochevieja falls on Friday) has concentrated the petitions on the week of December 13, with the result to the date of an avalanche of dinner reserves for peak days (16 and 17) and just movement for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the phase of weak cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners by budgetary question.
In order not to disregard tradition, many workers keep her paying for her own pocket.
Whatever the situation, some demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restoration de Barcelona, Gaiteàtà Farrás.
The employer's representative, to this day, does not hesitate to vacate what this month's festivities will be.
"People think about it long before they book."
"He wants to go out but has the alerts on the subject of prices," he points out.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to drop a step with the crisis, so that the fringe around the 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A survey of various central establishments shows the collapse of petitions by the night of 17.
In the Soteras group, there is a real boost of applications for Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulae of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has brought more advance booking, even since early November.
"We have done what is impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they say.
In AN Group, which banners El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locals, they remain optimistic after detecting a rise in billing from the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends that precede the parties.
The six group menus have added a Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that invite their employees back and feel that the volume of the groups is a little bigger.
By the patronal Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars Association, Restaurants and Leisure Barcelona), his vice president, Enric Gomà, hoped to start seeing the end of the tunnel and argues that as a whole the reservations are "animated", even though the customers "negotiate at most".
Yes, the illusion of parties has not come down, pay whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks' filtrations confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Alongside the enlightening and juicy details that they offer on the content of the talks and the thoughts of American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, rather than rising, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but are stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for developing in Washington.
This is listed by the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Counsellor, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the noisy dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and reason for keeping the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strong religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The most innovative of the documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the growing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani rate of nuclear weapons production.
A dispatch from the embassy in May, which calls "fructrating" the communication with Pakistan, says: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups".
In the hunt of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high leader in the anti-terrorist struggle to avoid new filtrations.
Interpol emits a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow Assange's movements."
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but date of November 20.
And it does not have to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents, but with the accusations of sexual abuse faced by the Australian in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator lawyer Mark Stephens states that "the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at Sweden's request, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as the organization has explained, do consider the so-called free-way notice network to proceed with a arrest -- which must involve the national police body, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter stating that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, has been willing to respond by videoconference to the Swedish authorities' questions.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden of the prosecutor's case, which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the chief of security of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal pursuit," the mission denounces.
As the world seeks him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence-- Assange remains in unknown whereabouts, but not shut up.
On Monday, an interview was given to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats spying on the UN by violating international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign," he said.
His opinion was expressed yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," CNN said.
Obama himself has entrusted a senior anti-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt of President Barack Obama's spokesman to remain important to Assange contrasts with the views that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House in January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue any contribution or aid."
Farther away, Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has had to retreat after saying that Assange should "be murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, ex- governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Whoever in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he said in the Fox chain.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with tails to the Achilles to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the endless internal revolt in the ERC ranks, without north by the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party's president is aware that his resignation oyster is insufficient for the apex by exleading Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as his mentor and that he can at all cause the headbreakers he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the left leader will try to win the new critics with guns that allow him to shield himself to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national advisers will be able to speak about their continuity in secret.
By paper, not by hand.
If the caradists want to drive a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do it without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the row wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered ratified by one-half more of the votes, but he added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be good a result "to Bulgaria".
The next to Carod requires the president something more than to make his position available to the militia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But if you don't have enough majority to force resignations, you'll try to agree with the executive a road map from here to May.
To that end, they look forward to participating in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will put to the vote by the national council on the 18th day.
His intention is to evaluate Puigcercós in return for this promise to advance the convention in the fall of 2011, something that the dome already gives in fact.
The leader of ERC recognized that "polyphony" damages stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, capable of washing the dirty door-to-doors.
In this line, the article that the post advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovation gave for the fact that the leader will be cooled "in exchange of various goals".
And he listed five, of those that stand out two.
The first, "recomposing" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, that is, to include new faces coming from the sector towards Carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that CER liquid once and for all assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it proposes a reform of the statutes allowing the congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
To end the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, who has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 convulsus conclave left the management responsible for reviewing assemblyism at a specific statute reform congress.
This date is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years was disenfranchised to deal with the matter.
Now, without sectors that are critical to obedience, it can be a good time to get it back and try to close it forever.
23 implemented in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the contents of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are the three women and the finding of a couple of bodies circled in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year there are 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gun shots and the funny shot at his head in addition to his feet and hands tied with cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the box of an abandoned vehicle on the street Mixtecs, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the municipality of Naucalpan.
On the morning of Thursday, four emissaries found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shootings in the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan motorway of the Sal, on the stretch that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Family Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman, was killed of eight bullets after leaving his house to start garbage collection work.
On the 7th of November, two 30-year-olds were completed with a bullet impact on their heads each in the colony San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shot on the front, a man's body was found on a lonely path of the Colony El Naranjo and underneath the body found a beaten helmet of firearm caliber 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Tepotzotlán's neighbors warned about the finding of a corpse that was in the Parje Peña Colorada, which was tied from the hands back and with the head bandaged.
The man had a gunshot wound in the neck.
Half a month later the execution of two men, who were wrapped in cobijas and abandoned in the box of a vehicle in streets of the fractionation Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17, wrapped in cobijas, two women were found lifeless in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning was located the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow cobija with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Ríos according to a message that his executioners left with him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots on the neck, was found the lifeless body of a woman in the village of San Francisco Aquautla.
In the woman's skin tattoos were detected from the Holy Death, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, the corpse of a man was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantpec with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with their head tied and a message were found in the community of Piedra Bridge, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This is what happens to those who don't align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tie of feet and hands, two bodies were found inside a abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín colony's Center of Justice.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them was decapitated in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him the agents found a cartridge with a message.
It maintains China's objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The country's representative at COP16 said that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and had detailed its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he stated that over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that regard.
He noted that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; building capacities; building institutions and supporting pilot programmes.
In all these areas progress has been made, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which reflects the objectives of reducing emissions of gases, explained.
On the other hand, it stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in a coordinated way with the state and local authorities to achieve energy savings objectives, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multi-year plans, funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries, are under way, or have already been concluded.
For example, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for the change of incandescent focus for savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and planning to do so both by 2020.
Pastes the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP's national leader stated that the former pastry leader is entitled to come to the National Order Commission to claim what his right is to do.
The NAP national leader, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former food manager was in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what his right would suit.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest taking as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the National Council's Order Commission, in his case, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that there was never an alliance at the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action will be strengthened by the internal election of the next 4th and 5th December, in which he will have to choose his successor.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The bread manager said that the NAP supports it for 71 years of dialogue, so "it does not scare us from internal competition; to the counter, "we enjoy and strengthen ourselves," he said.
He said that the council would certainly be able to choose the best or the best leader to require National Action for the next three years, so he would hand over the scam "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute calmness and openness, any of the five would be proud to deliver the office of the party's president."
He predicted that the repoint that the party recorded in the past elections of 4 July will be reflected in the next clashes, although "it's not yet time to think in 2012."
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be an observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will meet expectations."
As he was questioned about PRI's criticisms to President Felipe Calderon for his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called on the prisoners to reflect on the genders of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; let them begin to defend; let them come out of the cluster," he said.
He was of the view that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he did in his address at the National Auditorium, because there is no bite or much less censorship in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act law is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass it is legislation," the US president tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization today in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in their personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act law is the right thing, call your senators and urge them to pass it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link with a wider document that calls on the public to communicate immediately with the senators, as the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected soon, now is the time for your voice to be heard," he points out.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding was approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican embargo to the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable may be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a long time..."
"We all agree that we have to settle the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," she said.
The leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote of debate" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and have entered a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, at times when organizations that support the project play an intense role in ensuring the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
Therefore, the supporters of the Dream Act require the addition of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to back the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are the Senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but have declared that they will not back it up on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position right now.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put finger on the lake
The second round of Language Pleasures was a walk where the participants made the story lesson
"That sex in the tongue I understand but... the finger in the lake? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela to open the second round of Language Pleasures, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of his question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, he explained).
The finger in the lake... "puts us in apriests", gently played the Argentine writer to the public, mostly young, who was quoted at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate round table by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "Laga" is, it goes from doctor to doctor, from those who do not get answers even if they are clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiousologist comes convinced: "patience isn't my strength, maybe it's my laga."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the hall, but who makes it clear that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the lake is the open real, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the lake I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very undisturbed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narration entitled Elogio of the invention, where the finger in the lake is not named but in a moment of discovery.
With brushes of magical realism, a famous spell, which the same touched the clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that had lost a maid, narration that came to speak later America, the great novel that they did not miss from the beginning their own chronists who told her and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what was told by the conqueror captains.
"Cervants who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the pretense witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that he was missing to the very smell."
However, he pointed out that "the madmen and the brusters are the ones who best imagine" and that is where they converge reality and lie, where we no longer know that the story belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
It actually calls it the "cervantine tradition."
"By your inheritance we are what is told."
In turn, writer Mayra Montero waved and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with his round table The finger in the lake.
Cuban-Pirricina pointed out hers to the great lake of social violence that goes through her country - and shares Latin America - the product of drug trafficking and sale disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs close a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, after mentioning that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening closed the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the lake of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of the consciences that result in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind each assertion there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be owners of our thought and to be owners of reality we have to nuance: and nuance often means to put your finger on the pond and bother those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also bother the powers that prefer a black and white world," he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats at the end, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are also two different styles marked by their technicians, who encounter each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats at the end, he has had uplifts in his career, but he has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although he has so far gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special to him.
Argentinian has ended up in comfort with the medal of the sub-field, has stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive end.
The Sanctuary strategist strategist came to its first end as a coach at the opening Tournament 2002, when he carried the reins of the Morelia with which he fell overall of 4-2 to Toluca; later, in the Closure 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a global of 3-1 and was precisely before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again before the Devils, Rubén once again suffered a setback, as his team finished tie 2-2 to the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but on the penalty sign it was put in advantage of 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players theirs failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 turnout.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the misfortune and can celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important is the institution.
"I want to go champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an amateur I owe myself to, and therefore will come the title for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the Timonel when he was questioned about the numbers he has against playing final.
Very effective has the previous end, of which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee silences the end we cannot celebrate, we are ready on the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two criminals to draw we were already ready to run out and I think that is a teaching, until the party is finished we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that doesn't bother you, because it trusts its players: "One never seeks to get to the penalty sign, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there's nothing else and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately it made us a bad move the fate, sometimes by the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it left us, that left us something for this end that we hope will not get to that instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-fielder and to prove for the first time the glory that gives the titles.
EU changes rules to get visas
People should go to Visa Applicants Service centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedure to process a visa at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will be changed.
Under the new procedure, most applicants should attend Visa Applicants Service (ASC) centres before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff shall take biometric information from the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer will be necessary to make a payment to make the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the messaging service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for trade and investor visas.
People wishing to renew their visas will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest AUC where they will present their documents and take their tracks.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken at the AUC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain at this time less than in the past.
Also, those applying for visas in the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.

You'll announce NASA finding extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will reveal tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is an extraterrestrial life.
The findings will be presented in a press conference on Thursday morning at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the task of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA stated that it will present "a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life," prompting speculations from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures at our side and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and of this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "if there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will reveal the true scope of the findings at the press conference on Thursday morning.
The conference will participate in the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon in Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD gesture, PT, Convergence and Block Pattern opponent
With reforms to the Orgánica Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of the 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when an opposing bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of the 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, del PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, del PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tronavan' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it starts the 'bipartisanism', because now there will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will be in control of Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau of the Directive, headed by the Salvador López Brito paternalist and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo explained that with these reforms institutionally, it constitutes political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He stated that in the coming days they will speak with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not, they will be rebounded by both parties and the opposition coalition ended.
"Even here came (the opposition coalition), that's what I look at, because we're excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, it continued, that the Congress after it was monopolitical, now be "duopic".
"It is not the spirit to reform the law that has an eternal bipathism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other colleagues and companions to make them more, the convergent grew.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that today Congress has become a 'botin' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're sharing it between two."
Patron Montalvo, requested respect for the personality of the Member, was given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by doubling agreements, it's left out to 5 that we're probably going to make 9 deputies, it ahorites the five who see us, separated in different fractions, we've decided to unify ourselves to look for a place at the negotiating table, that's the issue that in the reform they made that they agreed, we're out and we don't agree with that reform."
Out $200,000 more for "the supplier"
Pay Mazatlan City Council another check to the questioned owner of company of electrical material.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the company of electrical material, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, by the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "requirement of accounts to be paid".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that he would raise more money from the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit Office for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and, therefore, how many more cheques are missing from being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you are simply paying for what is due, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "recovered" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Act marks when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using their services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after the 25th of July, Northwest published a review of the cheques issued by the City Council to its suppliers, which revealed that, from March 2008 to 9th of July 2010, in the Triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to attend tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs complain of foreign tourist accidents due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the Mazatlán tourist sector asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and to project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on several occasions they have denounced that the image of fate is taken care of and reversed the evil that tourists encounter with new activities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and the banquets has affected because the tourists come to walk and see the mess and take the back to the nearby businesses.
"Politicals do not know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or otherwise do not do the works in this way in such a time and without proper planning."
Hoteler José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the town hall's lack of prevention and maintenance.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, as it does, by giving preventive maintenance and not just falling into corrective action," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other places that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and the Venadite of Mazatlan.
"Today, in order for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance on what the tourist attractions are," he said.
"There has been no due attention and this kind of fact indicates something that is notorious for all, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under-Secretary for Tourism Promotion, said that rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be priority to have the city a day, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Thankfully Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that will have to be ordered first, clean up and put in line to make them attractive to add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A law of decent and free work between parties and the state executive calls for the Mazatlan business sector, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature, composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and one more of the PVEM, has been installed, summarizing a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they come to achieve clean and commitment management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and do not repeat the same patterns of partisanism or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly-extended 40 state Congress deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary to make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival pares of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
Hence, he spoke of making the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move on to the Ruler in turn.
"We take care that they come to do a decent job and especially committed to society and the sectors because it was the signoese who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, which generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage job generation."
As regards tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the weight he has in the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that directly competes with agro-industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for detonating tourist projects and to assist in providing security to the state and updating the Alcohols Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
A Magician King Is Seeked
Dogs, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For his parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please his illusions, as his home is made up of nothing but 12 people and a key.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and the clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home of the Colonia Salvador Allende and lives a day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn't have chamba, but we sell mandarin and papa... I'm already going out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo aspires for a long time to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothes cut for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said to him, 'Let's see son,' because he was very expensive,' he recalls with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, those in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11-year-old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10-year-old, is size 10, while Michael, 8-year-old, uses size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela can take part in the campaign You are looking for a Mago King, giving a toy or cash in the reception of Northwest.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a decade of persecution has been carried out in connection with the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the production of drugs was carried out.
"They have seized about 750 Cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the security of Quebec.
In total, eleven men and three women, including the two supposed network leaders, two Sherbrooke men, have been arrested.
The detainees had to appear in Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of Cannabis production, possession with the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have been carried out following a long investigation which has lasted for about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out arrests," said Mr.Ruel.
In this police operation, approximately seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie Research Module, Sherbrooke Police Service and Memphremagog Police Department participated.
Can be fought against clandestine migration without problems
The Conservatives' bill that, according to the Government, should solve the problem of fathers loaded with illegal migrants, would surely face great opposition, since the three opposition parties had announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created granite that weighs," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals defend that the bill in its present form, which would allow for a one-year detention of anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants, infringes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against and, it seems, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
The NPD’s immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that indicate that its party is not strong enough with clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree that measures are taken against the leaders of the clandestine fathers, and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least one year," says Mrs Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and of ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians say to Members that they do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as a falpudo."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," says Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, one conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was to request a vote to be held so that each Member who opposes is later explained to his constituents.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Research in New York since January last year.
Metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday’s announcement has caught up with more than one surprise.
It can be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Quebec Police Services held on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
That was enough for the Quebec Party critic who dealt with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of the chistera" and as "a last-minute chapucera solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You will see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest is obsessed with avoiding the creation of this committee of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have an investigation commission is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead spot, suggest Quebec to give a special mandate to the general intervener to conduct a survey on collision and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervener," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent quadrangle is not the only wax project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be from the Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed on his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
During the spring 2001 operation related to motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons had been arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the law on gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to the heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a land course in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, they have evacuated from homes.
In the evening, another land course took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions had severe rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
In addition, an additional 20 to 40 millimetres are expected from now to Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these rainfall is added to the snow-drill that had already accumulated in certain sectors, several rivers are feared to overflow.
On Wednesday night, the civil security unit of Quebec issued alerts for the Ouareau and Acigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the strong rains have dragged a provisional bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civilian security unit remains alert and monitors the situation closely, as Annik Bouchard has indicated, security adviser.
The Centre for the Prevention of the Growth of Quebec, for its part, issued on Wednesday announcements communicating the strong growth of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partly blame Dupont
The Radio Presenter of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback to the Canadian Council of Radiotelevision Standards (CNR) by controversial statements on social assistance and on Haitians, as well as its crude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians and rough language that should not be used in the broadcasts during the day".
The Council also indicated that the debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints in relation to comments made on broadcast emissions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the common Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must report reliable and not misleading data.
In relation to suicide, the presenter Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most Committee members have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes questioned by "Dupont le midi" have treated a delicate issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
Consequently, any guilt has been disposed of in this regard.
The last dispute referred to the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been involved in a media confrontation that had triggered many reactions.
The presenter of CHOI stated that he had not made any donation to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already fulfilled my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of rough language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio channel has collaborated "including more than what is required".
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which will, inter alia, have to announce the decisions once at the highest hearing hours within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian watchtower Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, goes up to the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I seek fights everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security officer and employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the Amateur World Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shu World Cup in China."
"They will invite sportsmen who have finished between the first four positions in the world's last championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended up in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I won the third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this step, I will be the first time or next year!"
The "san shoo" or "sand" is a discipline from China in which it is allowed to hit with fists and feet, as well as throw the opponents to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only have a competition in his career, he will no doubt go to the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the sympathetic boy.
"It's like the equivalent to the Lumbinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand). "
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost at the end.
"He who has won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face at the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts of $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy Management, was created in 2004 following the decision by Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important five billion-dollar hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy management consortium obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and provoke a rise in prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and of eliminating competition."
"I mean, people, instead of doing it in secret, now they do it openly," the Quebec Party deputy Sylvain Simard said yesterday in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question in the National Assembly because he said he did not understand how it could benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there has been a collision with this contract.
"I'm getting tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a "denominated" manner and "with a lack of rigor."
He noted that "minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, this is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been granted without any competition being involved; it has been dealt with a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortia in the technical advisory sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's trade register allows to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche and Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Managed Consortium, Minister Normandeau has highlighted that "the territory of the James Bay responds to a particular work force dynamics and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s".
The Chief Chief of the Eastmain Project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and at a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract granted to the Energy Management consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Genivar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account his participation in Energy management.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy management contract of $295,131,31,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has let it happen that the PQ is also linked to these companies, that they "finance it", before he needs to know that it is more about their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer from Quebec only trusts the players of sustainable development, as well as fair trade marks and ecological certificates to guide their elections.
According to the responsible consumption barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where they propagate messages that defend more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even hinders its commitment.
Even if the consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's responsible Consumer Observatory.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "corresponsible", says Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the speeches of politicians on this issue seriously.
In any case, the information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the questionable nature of information make 46% of consumers reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also say they are suspicious of the supposed yields of ecological products or services that they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61 per cent has given priority to shopping in the shops in their neighborhood and has preferred to buy food grown in their region, reports Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the rate of responsible consumption has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumerus of Quebec loves to occupy the place of the king of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness seems to be from doors (of its car) outside: in 2010, only 28 per cent of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behaviour survey, which has just completed their first edition, supports the use of bicycles and on foot displacements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to which they have requested to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who were expecting a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois back the eXcentris cinematographic complex in the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and return his true cinematographic vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to become involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, which would actually be lower than the initial expectations; it could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million last spring, but since then applications have been reviewed on the ground.
The President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, submitted a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent her a last report a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counter proposal from the Cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have deadline until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation must be completely discarded.
Let us recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives from the sector do demand considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has for ten years carried the burden of the author's cinema on his premises, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent film rooms was evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyalty to his clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open the way for acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on the next 27th of February, projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des deux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not once again contacted Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group of proposals at the bottom they have received.
The veil of Canada's completed...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to the Americans, but at the same time reflect their sense of superiority toward Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think of Canada-United States relations when they are going to vote and believe President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government get their budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy of Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, offer more juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, reports to what extent the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This brought great surprise to the U.S. ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of almost inherent inferiority to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), " she writes.
It concludes, therefore, that the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "insurgent silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party, and, more importantly, of the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which voters should think about voting."
This sense of importance can also be seen from the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will contribute to ensuring the government's survival during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will first record deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion," says Mr. Breese.
Nowhere does it mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties conditioned its survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image of the dramatic series broadcast in the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable reports that during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to host some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but he depended on "each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have been warmed in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on CBC's radio that the responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
Mike Huckabee echoes in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancún a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEI) in almost one third of the additional decrease to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is framed in the whole of major concrete projects that the UN expects to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by bulbs of electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1,800 million tons (Gt) of GEI emitted on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary automobile park.
In Copenhagen, last year, large issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 gt of this quantity should still be reduced to stabilize by 2020 the increase in temperatures by two degrees centigrade to prevent it from being out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced by twice as much.
The fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80 per cent less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the saving that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with resotes and emit very little heat.
Above all, they contain nothing of mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not fluocompact bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity falling with incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States do these plants issue 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2,500 million.
Côte d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the announcement of electoral results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the interim results immediately," a spokesperson from the UN chief stressed.
"Ask all the Côte d'Ivoire parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left the deadline of Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days since Sunday's polling.
About 40 minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the CIS had commented on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the requests that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and its opponent Alassane Ouattara have been multiplied in the world.
However, the Gbagbo band has the Constitutional Council's annulment of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Côte d'Ivoire, said that the intimidation maneuvers of the voters carried out by the FNs in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who demeans any relationship with the former rebels, has judged "unacceptable" the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from spreading the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidents, on Sunday, should have led to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations has warned the Costa de Marfil political class that they could be considered responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25 per cent in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent in the light of overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by temporary seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in continental France.
Data for the second quarter have been confirmed, with 9.3 per cent of the working population in continental territory and 9.7 per cent with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Generally, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, are available within two weeks to work and seek or not work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), and 25% including the DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older people, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, up to 6.6% with the DOMs.
There has only been a stability of unemployment among people aged between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Since 2006 Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53-year-old, head of waste-processing companies and brother-in-law of the President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for the abuse of social goods, misappropriation of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influences and possession of ammunition, as his lawyer indicates.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all questions raised by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue him through a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," he told the AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before the appearance of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of their nearby people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been to deal with the landfills that he has to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their implementation, he knows nothing about it, according to counsel Simon.
As part of this file, it is also being investigated since Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but has left him on parole and has prohibited meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been rebutted to him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken into account the explanations and has released him," explained his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night on Wednesday, four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of the Property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged with "trafficking of passive influences and corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier have been questioned for "substracting and misappropriating public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion Jeannie Peretti is being investigated by "covering the abuse of social goods".
Among the people who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to whiten the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the research indicates that the research focuses especially on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseilles (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, Clotilde Reiss's destination, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionaje", has been in public rage in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the watchful gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
Describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "rehens" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They showed how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought by the U.S. justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
The Councilor of Eliseo for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with American diplomat Kathleen Alllegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens detained for force in Iran.
"Haced noise," they say, "sold continually" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "inocence", "immediate liberation".
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because, once attempts to negotiate by discreet channels have been exhausted, "silentness will not solve anything," Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers."
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day on which he will take refuge at the French embassy) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (€230,000 of reward).
In addition, he points out that Eliseo anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that will "increase".
Iranians could "in the near future stop another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is requesting for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of nuclear material, Majid Khakavand's exile is bad news.
Did France accept an exchange?
To free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Alllegrone, on September 4, François Richier assured us that it was not so.
El Elisha, says, not only "he has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but he has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot annul the decision", he comments.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand is still under the "close" surveillance of French information services.
Eliseo's counselor marks a telephone number, hangs up and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss's detention in Iran, Eliseo does not spare any effort, uses media-organized communiqués and "fugas" to make Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad believe that he plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and check that manipulation brings its fruits, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions the media 'blitz' of French officials.
What is the "gratitude" due to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that have led Elisha to stand up to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been marked with premature and demerited".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries to "show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows that from good sources.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we've thanked him."
"At least this should cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Eliseo.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played an "active role in the liberation of our country".
From midnight, Korean youth cannot play online
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called Cinderella that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, as indicated by government officials.
In December a bill will be submitted to Parliament to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as indicated by representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Family.
"Many children play all night, and then it's hard for them to study in school and live a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, a ministerial officer in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, which is precise.
The government is also asking companies to limit their daily access time to these games when young people’s parents so request, the manager added.
It will also make it available to those who request free software to limit the internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online games competitions.
In November, South Korea obtained four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by the suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee designates Thursday to the World Cups countries of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political choice where the fights of influence and lobbying can come to prevail over the technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional base of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons who were members of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of the Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests at stake in a World.
The transactions between behindrs, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Tetrii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of their country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has exposed three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the English officials, who have launched to intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron in the head.
The Chief of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup taken by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the JJO.O. 2012.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain the shine of England to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Duo España-Portugal also has many strong points thanks to its already ready stadiums, its experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Copa de Europa in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could lower their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they can do is give points to Russia, converted into a weight outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stations, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced a "illegal competence in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
"They're getting their dirty rags off, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favorite.
First world economic power and headquarters of the major sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have jointly organized the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the World 2026 to China, strongly desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to remain without possibility for 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of TV rights paid (as a function of time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the FIFA war.
Second mandate: proof
De Gaulle had really doubted it.
Mitterrand had come to understand that he was doubting.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had neither the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be re-elected in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear to be doubting.
On one side and on the other.
In 2006, even if they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends said that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in autumn 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the MPU's deputies, on Tuesday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some riot.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not at all.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the five-year mandate number to two.
He was simply transmitting the facts, not an ad.
This is not the first time you talk about the presidents, with a playful tone, in encounters of this type.
"In the worst, or rather, cases, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't wonder what will come next."
His claims of yesterday no longer approach the candidacy, nor any less.
They raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the career by applying for PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the fact that Segolène Royal has gone up to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is organized before what is anticipated.
On the other hand, the bad probes.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidature of François Filon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," the Prime Minister immediately and prudently responded.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"You will always think you can win," says Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for the exit of the crisis or at least to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Emission Institute will certainly not be allowed to be so perennial if it does not want to risk aggravating a more complicated situation in European bond markets today.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the active role played by the ECB in the resolution of the debt crisis of the European States.
He did not want to say whether he felt that the central bank should do more, e.g. by increasing its purchase programme for state obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
On the eve in Brussels, during its hearing with the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, showed no more eloquentness as to his intentions, only indicating that the State's purchasing programme on the "continued" secondary market and that "we will see what we decided" at the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will maintain its main invariable rate at 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury obligations by the ECB has doubled last week to about EUR 1,350 million.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet marketers, yesterday it would have purchased Irish and Portuguese titles again.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities for an amount of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt as little as possible that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists do not foresee any significant change in course either.
Although loan operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still carries out unlimited liquidity allocations on beneficial and lasting terms ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I can't imagine you're going to change your program considerably."
"If not, it would be at risk for new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a gradual release announced during the first quarter of 2011," said Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of those obligations to keep the market stable," Norbert Bräms added.
Taking into account the importance of European bank exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"You must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked increase in the yields paid by the weaker States," he said yesterday as an important obligation manager.
Because, if the rates of interest are set in the clouds, States will have even more problems in reducing or stabilizing their debt.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government caps the temporal
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation slightly improved yesterday with the decline of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the beginning of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have stated that Giulio Tremonti heard the situation of "undeservable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any event, on Tuesday, the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had been shot up to 263 points, causing a certain revolution in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was manifested "deeply concerned" by "market turbulences" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of being unable to meet its funding needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts have been a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on a figure of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3 per cent of GDP next year (compared to 3.9 per cent of government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (instead of 2.7 per cent).
That is why the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the parties, for a sum of EUR 7. billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures should be taken," says Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of your economy are in order and your accounts in good condition, as we have said for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator in the Italian International Monetary Fund responsible for the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested to Italy are smaller than those required to other countries," says Pier Carlo Paduan, head economist of the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of crisis control mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe we have already demonstrated Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday's relaxation in the types of European States' obligations has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower the debt rating of Portugal, the most common target at the moment of speculation.
"As in May, political clarity and transparency are really lacking, which weighs significantly on banking systems," economists of Exane BNP Paribas say.
Especially because "political rhythm is much slower than the pace of markets".
Aware of this hiatus and of the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying the debates to strengthen the mechanisms for exiting the existing crisis.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
This also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market-filler (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has launched a trip to Singapore on Tuesday in Asia to inform investors in the Far East of the developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
It is expected that the first EFF securities issues will be issued next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative has entrusted the Reuters agency that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
With regard to the first-line countries, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path to which Greece and Ireland followed.
Both of them want to avoid all costs for international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and to decide the structural reforms that they consider necessary to build confidence in a lasting manner.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European Funds have the options available to accelerate the process of normalising public bond markets.
Passing through Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750,000 million mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to return to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe that an additional amount of about EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, which currently has EUR 60 billion.
A council which could certainly examine European capital in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snows continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to mid-day and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although they also snow slightly on the island of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, at times between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Baja Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosín.
The snows are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, alert to Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited for heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Landion and Saint-Brieuc-Ludeac axes.
According to gendarmes, traffic in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it is not conducted except in case of need and that certain TER vehicles have been banned during the day.
During Thursday, school transport in Picardía has been banned.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "insites all drivers to drive with the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The General Directorate for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Parisian Roissy airport and 10% at Orly due to the planned snows.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, South London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro of Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the island of France has reached its high point, billions have reached.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we speak of the 23 billion for the Grand Paris subway that the Société du Grand Paris must build.
In order to start this GSP, the State has announced a funding allocation of EUR 4 billion.
At the theoretical level, this amount will later enable the GSP to obtain market loans to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Law on Corrigendum Finance, which was discussed at the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in office tax on France's Island.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a change in a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from 4,000 million.
"The tax resources must be added to the EUR 4 billion of the allocation of funds to be mobilised by the State and granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP doesn't surprise this system.
"As soon as income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explain."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The GSP estimates that it will begin to receive the 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4,000 million are not included in the credit, can cause a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Avengant hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy governing relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound international changes and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (independently from the nation to which it belongs) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records should only be formed by news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for new facts about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to the occult not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret records.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, editor of the Liberation), which only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sending the U.S. embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same as that published the Newsweek the week before.
Why, then, have the revelations of these records caused such a revolution?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that the embassies, at least since World War II and since the heads of States can call themselves by phone or catch the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have become spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows perfectly, we just pretend we don't know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both victims and "verdugues".
But we enter the true nature of what has happened.
Previously, in Orwell's day, he could be conceived of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The prophecy of Orwell has come true since, having been able to control each movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction performed, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as now happens, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the vengeful citizen) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that cannot even retain its own secrets be endured?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to take away all power from him.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, as it would be like to publish it on a road map.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, confidential telephone conversations cannot be expected.
Nothing is easier than discovering whether and when a Head of State has moved on a plane and has contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they maintain in the future private and confidential relations?
I know perfectly well that for the time being, my prediction is science fiction and, therefore, newscast, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, as much, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
This information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked boxes: in the end, the spy attempt of Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is now advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
Video tapes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digital) only allow to advance or retreat from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travels it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that communication policies and techniques bring us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly going on in the embassies.
The embassies are currently asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s caps on its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider whether the fast-tracked funding promises (called fast start or early ones) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French carpets have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to providing EUR 7.200 million in three years and France EUR 1.260 million (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was a remarkable result and was appreciated for what really was worth: the developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2010 EUR 2.2 billion, which puts it on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment to EUR 7.200 million in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the most appropriate reference.
For example, the European Commission has made reference to 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years in terms of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or at the level of official development aid.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" for 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the costs of previous years or the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of aid from France to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the split between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no norm and each one chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, consider each euro to be equivalent to a euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on the most effective technologies), it is a mistake to present a euro which is going to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, only the cost of the loan to the country that grants the loan (i.e. the equivalent to a interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find this reasoning useful: "respect" its commitment of EUR 420 million making 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (EUR 36.1 million); see the EU document to see it for its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union which uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it in 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to meet its commitment, France only gives ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Good trick!
In short, in its fast start funding, France commits double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
By spending just €36.1 million, you can give the impression that you spend 420 million "new and additional", as you promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems to be Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give when they can simply lend?) as in the negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid...
The early financing chapter is a minute, relative to the short-term, in relation to the whole climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra sand grain in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could move forward discussions on betting in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister of Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive at Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning on pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests on a day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Association Generations Futures (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "are not of significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with," acquired food that is usually consumed by a child in four meals and a daily snack in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These meals taken as a model, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as golosins, were examined in laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as possible or likely carcinogens and five substances classified as safe cancers, as well as 37 substances capable of acting as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although almost all cases do not exceed the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually, our study clearly shows that exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying," the association noted.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain only more than a decade of possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe cancers, as well as about twenty wastes that may harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, which is intended to be attempted for school, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a forbidden fungicide in France.
The same applies to the green Jews in Kenya, including in food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian steak, tuna in can and even the bread bar or chicle were fitted with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon roll was the most "nutrient" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these "pollution cocktails" for the consumer "probably underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europa Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "against the seriousness of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
